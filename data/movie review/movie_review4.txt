I walked into the screening theatre with a bit of apprehension. I confess I am a big Matt Damon fan. He did a tremendous job as Jason Bourne in the previous three episodes. However Jeremy Renner is a refreshingly pleasant surprise as the new agent. He is a great actor who has tremendous screen presence and energy. Rachel Weisz as Dr. Snyder is outstanding. Ed Norton as Byer does not have too many lines but his expressions show why he is such a great actor. The story is excellent and so is Tony Gilroy's direction. The action scenes will keep you at the edge of your seats. The finale on the streets of Manila is aligned with the previous three Bourne movies. The locations chosen are perfect. The cinematography is grabbing especially the scenes which were shot in Alberta, Canada. The Bourne Legacy is a must see not only for the Bourne fans but also for those who love a good story and good action movies. I am going to watch it again and pay for it when it is released in August. It's well worth it!

Just saw the Bourne Legacy at a screening in NY and is the newest chapter in the bourne franchisee.I was not quite sure how the movie would be as there is no Matt Damon, no Paul Greengrass. But I have to admit it the movie was a awesome. I am a huge fan of Bourne series and this movie lives up to its expectations.The action is kick-ass, also shot in Philippines, and has a powerful performance from Renner, Norton and Rachel Weisz.The movie is great, watch it if you like action movies. To sum it up it is AWESOMETACULAR.

Boise was lucky enough to get an early look at 'The Bourne Legacy' hosted by producer Frank Marshall. So, 'The Bourne Legacy' isn't a continuation of the previous 3 movies. In fact, 'Legacy' runs concurrently with 'Ultimatum'. Though they are separate movies, some of 'Ultimatum' finds its way into this film. Alex Cross (Jeremy Renner) is a new breed of super soldier from the Outcome program. The action sequences are top notch. Like the previous 3 movies, there is an awesome chase scene...this time on motorcycles through the streets of Manilla!For those looking for their Bourne fix, this movie delivers. While Matt Damon's character isn't in this film, Jeremy Renner's performance is a great reboot to this franchise. One negative, if I have to call it a negative, is that the ending of this movie is way too abrupt. I felt like there was more to this movie to come when the ending music hit and the credits rolled. I felt like I had just watched half of a movie.It's obvious there will be another installment.

That new hero is Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner, an intelligence agent who is part of a secret government program called Outcome that uses pharmacology to enhance soldiers' brains and bodies. After the events in "Ultimatum," in which Jason Bourne tears up New York City evading his former handlers, Outcome's head (Ed Norton) decides to shut down his program and kill all its members.The movie is much more then what I expected, It is high octane, contains all the state-of-art action and Renner is amazing in his new role. This new movie certainly contains the element that were in the original trilogy. There's great action and a wonderful chemistry between the leads.Yeah, first, my thoughts of a "Bourne" movie without the real Bourne were quiet apprehensive, but it's much better then i thought And for those who think that this is not a good movie, without Matt Damon...Never judge a book bye it's cover

Questionable follow up to the Bourne trilogy that has the right pieces in place but lacks the conviction to justify its existence. Taking place almost at the same time of the climax of the third Bourne film (Ultimatum), this film deals with the fall out of the exposure of "Operation Blackbriar" and how an another agency with in the government is trying to cover up their program in order not to be caught up with the coming scandal create by Jason Bourne. "Outcome", the program in question is an offshoot of both "Treadstone" and "Blackbriar" but with a huge difference, they are tabbing into science to create super agents that are faster and stronger than any other agent before them. In order for me to tell you what is good about this movie, I have to explain what is wrong with it and that is the fact that you get the feeling fifteen minutes into the film that there is no reason for it to exist. The last film (Bourne Ultimatum) pretty much closed the book on the series, with little to no wiggle room for an encore. This movie feels like a studio trying to milk dried what was good from the original trilogy in order to make more sequels. The bad part is that they did it in the most unbelievable way, so much so that you really need to forget what you saw in the last three films in order to believe what was going on in this movie. Tony Gilroy (Who wrote the first three movies) directs and writes this one but falls flat on his face with halfhearted explanations that try to justify this movie's existence. Not to mention the fact that the villain of the movie is a lightweight compared to what came before him plus the glaring fact that Edward Norton's performance as the heavy is pretty much phoned in. He does not have the confidant arrogant swagger that Chris Cooper's character had in the first film nor the desperate menace of that Brain Cox's character brought to the second. Norton's character is more in line with the villain of the third, who was played by David Strathaim (who has a cameo in this film). However, Strathaim's character had a sense of justifiable menace that drove him, while Norton's character just seems like a man trying to justify his actions for the greater good, making him more of a government shill than a villain. The science fiction angle that comes up is insulting to what the last three films were, not to mention the fact that the direction here lacks the kinetic energy that Paul Greengrass brought to the last two movies of the series. Say what you may about the shaky camera work but he knew how to stage a thrilling action piece of pop art. Gilroy's motorcycle chase towards the climax is decent but lacks kinetic spark. He is however very good in staging small intimate moments within this movie but that is more a compliment to the A + cast (Mainly his two lead actors) than the terrible script that they are forced to working with.Jeremy Renner is a talented actor with serious range and complexity. However, the character he plays is not much of a character and the script that he has to work with is riddled with cliché after cliché. He can do anything a secret agent can do but better but the character is not very compelling or interesting to say the least. Jason Bourne was a compelling character that needed to find himself and through that journey in the original trilogy, we saw complexities that were compelling and thoughtful. He was a conflicted man whose drive was dictated by an inner sense of redemption. The character of Aaron Cross is a cartoon character compared to Jason and that is the main problem of the script for this movie. It is though Renner's efforts as an actor that we care about the character of Aaron Cross and that is one of the few bright spots this film has. Renner injects likability and vulnerability to this character and because of it, we want him to succeed in beating the bad guy and save the girl but Renner is working with a script that goes against itself and we are left with a half fast story that deals with supermen than a human story about survival. It is through Renner's efforts as an actor that we see humanity and conflict in this character while the script itself does not give that sort of detail and Renner is working overtime to accomplish that. Renner would have done wonders with a compelling character like Jason Bourne, unfortunately that is not found with the character of Aaron Cross.Rachel Weisz is one of the most versatile, gifted and complex actors working today. An actor's actor in every sense of word but like Renner, she does not have much of a character thanks to the cliché script they both have to work with. Her character is on the run with Cross through out the film and acts as his doctor and object of protection. It is through Weisz's amazing strength and range as an actor that we are able to witness levels of complexity and humanity in the character of Dr Marta Shearing that we really do not get from the script. Because of that, we are not only able to care and identify with her but Weisz actually makes her character more complex and interesting than Aaron Cross himself. You can tell that Weisz was working overtime in achieving that and her efforts pay off ten fold, which is a blessing considering that most of the characters outside of her and Renner come across as cardboard cutouts.It is a shame because Renner and Weisz try their best and for the most part succeed despite all odds but they like the fans deserved better.

Saw a Sneak Preview tonight and it is an awesome suspense/action flick. The movie grabs you from the beginning scenes and never lets up. Jeremey Renner is a Grade A replacement for Matt Damon. He has become a first rate star for roles like this. The direction by Tony Gilroy is superb. This mans knows how to direct films like this! The supporting cast (including a very fine Rachel Weisz) are very good also. Edward Norton in particular stands out in his role, which you would expect from a fine actor like Norton. In addition the stunts and the special effects were all first rate. Can't wait for the sequel that is surely going to be made.......

At first I didn't think I would like this movie when I saw the trailer for the first time. Then I continued to see the trailer in other movies I went to see and I thought OK, maybe I will go see this. Thankfully I did not pay to see this. My friends won passes so we were able to go see it. My friend Meka summed it up best "At least it was free because I wouldn't even go see it for $1" This movie took too much time to get things started and then when it got started it ended. They jumped around too much and tried to fit too much of the 3rd movie while trying to show something different in this one. The was not enough action and it just fell flat and doesn't even feel like it should be in the Bourne franchise. Save your money and wait to see this one.

The last movie that this reviewer saw was the remake of Total Recall, and films like that one would make one think: "do we really need another Bourne movie – let alone one that doesn't even have Jason Bourne in it?" Paul Greengrass, director of the later two Bourne films in the original trilogy, jokingly suggested making a fourth one named The Bourne Redundancy, and its star Matt Damon similarly expressed a degree of disdain for a new film. The whole concept of a franchise spin-off does seem to reek of Hollywood cash grab. However, rest assured – Bourne's legacy remains completely untarnished, because, boy, is this a good one.The Bourne Legacy is, unfortunately, a movie people haven't really been excited about. It's been lost in the shuffle of late-Summer blockbusters, and its premise has been met with indifference. Well, Tony Gilroy and co. have to be given their due. This was intended to be a straight sequel to The Bourne Ultimatum, with Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass set to reprise their roles as star and director respectively, but it eventually fell through. It's safe to say that Gilroy, who co-wrote all three of the Bourne films and who co-wrote this one with his brother Dan, has more than salvaged the situation.The Bourne Legacy is taut, intelligent, bristling with tension and excitement and is an overall harrowing ride from start to finish. Gilroy finds a near-perfect blend of smarts and action such that one never drowns out the other, and, thankfully, he's less of a shaky-cam proponent than his predecessor Greengrass was. The story is coherent, the characters reasonably well-defined, and just like the first three Bourne films there's always an undercurrent of credibility, and the realism that The Bourne Identity reinvigorated the espionage film genre with is in good form here. While some bits, particularly the "super-soldier" angle, are a bit of a stretch, it's never ridiculous and always absorbing. There's a sense of continuity established by the inclusion of some footage from Ultimatum as well as Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn and Albert Finney reprising their roles in briefer parts, and it's used just enough so the connection doesn't feel contrived.One of the primary challenges this film faced was making Aaron Cross a well-defined character and distinct enough from Jason Bourne. This challenge is mostly overcome, in that while Cross isn't as complex and intriguing as Bourne, he's still great fun to watch. Jason Bourne was a confused and disoriented man who had to come to terms with his muddled past, make sense of the remarkable skills he possessed and preserve whatever new relationships he formed. Aaron Cross on the other hand knows full well what he's doing, and is a little more idealistic and fresh-faced than Bourne was. With the help of those special pills, he gains incredible physical and mental skills, shuffling between martial artistry, official documents forgery and resourceful Mac-Gyvering with ease. In an early scene, he outfoxes a pack of wolves and bests a military drone sent to kill him at the same time. That's pretty badass. Of course, there's a little of the inner conflict Bourne had so much of, but Renner makes sure to keep the angst perfectly in check.Dr Marta Shearing, as played by Rachel Weisz, is a lot more than the token action movie chick. It's a clever move to have the female lead be a scientist indirectly involved in the protagonist's predicament, who is as integral to the plot as he is. Sure, Rachel Weisz probably doesn't quite look like a genetic scientist, but she's a lot more believable than the boatload of hotties Hollywood has been trying to pass off as geniuses for years (Denise Richards and Jessica Alba, anyone?) – and a much better actress too. She's the frightened woman jolted out of her everyday existence as much as she is an intelligent and level-headed scientist, and this isn't one of those films with a romantic subplot crowbarred in for no reason.The antagonists in this film, much as in the first three films, aren't cackling, maniacal megalomaniacs – they're intelligence officers, analysts and bureaucrats acting under orders, efficient, quietly menacing and dangerously amoral, with a frightening wealth of resources at their fingertips. Edward Norton plays the main bad guy – which, for the geeks out there, means Hawkeye is pitted against the (other) Incredible Hulk. He's undoubtedly a brilliant actor, and doesn't let the fact that his character is mostly confined to mission control hinder his performance. For the most part though, he never comes face-to-face with Cross, but he and his team always feel like a menace. It's an exciting game of cat and mouse to watch, with Cross half a step ahead of his pursuers, but never for long.The Bourne Legacy pulls through, retaining much of that Bourne spirit yet nary a sense of been-there-done-that or, God forbid, a direct-to-video feel. It turns out to be quite a bit more than a decently-written piece of fan-fiction – it's a clever, high-energy espionage thriller that could have easily felt slapped-together or cheap, but is instead well-conceived, well-crafted and well-acted. We certainly hope Matt Damon will be tempted to return to the series to team up with Renner should a sequel materialise.

To find an actor in place of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne was going to be close to impossible, so series writer Tony Gilroy did the next best thing – he created a Bourne-like agent in the form of Aaron Cross, and cast character actor Jeremy Renner in that role. Not only that, to leave room for the possibility of Matt Damon's return, Gilroy created what we would call a 'side-quel' – in other words, a movie whose events unfold in parallel with that in the last Bourne movie with Damon, 'The Bourne Ultimatum'.It's a good premise we'd have to admit, but Gilroy here makes one misstep – he decided to take over the reins from Paul Greengrass as director. Oh don't get us wrong, the veteran writer who first ventured into the director's seat with the critically acclaimed 'Michael Clayton' and then the playful 'Duplicity' is a capable director in his own right, but his inclination for exposition as well as his lack of experience in crafting the sort of tense action that audiences have come to expect from any respectable Bourne film prove to be this 'Legacy's' weakest spots. Indeed, one of the key reasons why the Bourne films have been so compelling was Doug Liman's (who directed the first 'Bourne Identity') and Greengrass' ability to tell an intriguing espionage story within the context of a traditional action movie, paring down the narrative to its essentials so the overall film moves at a lean brisk pace. Gilroy however clearly favours plot over action, and while that isn't a bad thing in itself, it becomes so when it's clear what story (scripted by Tony Gilroy together with his brother Dan) there is has little to add to the Bourne universe beyond what was already established in the earlier films. So once again, Cross goes on the defensive as the CIA tries to shut down one of its programmes, fearing the backlash that will no doubt follow if it were leaked to the public. The connection to Bourne? 'Outcome' was a companion programme to 'Treadstone', though genetic modification was applied only on the former. Narrowly escaping a drone attack ordered by the Agency on a remote Alaskan bunker, Cross returns to the United States to find his genetic meds he believes are crucial to his survival – blue for brain functioning and green for athletic performance. Help once again lies in a lady whom he will develop a connection towards by the end of the film – a certain Dr Marta Shearing (Rachel Wesiz), who herself had a harrowing escape from her ex-colleague programmed to kill all scientists with knowledge of 'Outcome' (and a word of caution that this particular shooting scene might offend some sensitivities given the two recent real-life shootings in the United States). Beneath a lot of talk about how super-soldiers like Cross can be created by the interaction of viruses, chromosomes and mitochondria is really a straight-forward chase film where Cross and Shearing have to stay one step ahead of his former boss Eric (Edward Norton). If 'Bourne Legacy' feels familiar every step of the way, it's because you've actually seen parts of it in different Bourne films before. The crisis room dealings ring smack of 'Bourne Supremacy' and 'Bourne Ultimatum', the slow-burning relationship between Cross and Shearing is reminiscent of that between Damon and Franka Potente in 'Bourne Identity' and even the extended climax featuring a parkour-like chase through the rooftops of the shantytowns of Manila followed by a motorbike chase sequence through its busy streets reminds one of two similar sequences in 'Ultimatum'. Alongside a distinct lack of originality, Gilroy also never gives his audience much reason to care about his central character Cross. The first three 'Bourne' movies were told primarily through the eyes of Bourne, allowing their audience to experience his confusion, determination, perseverance, and thirst for justice. Here, Cross is on a mission to find his pills, and while that is well and dandy, it just seems trivial and uninvolving compared to Bourne's mission. Gilroy's choice of giving more screen time to Shearing and Byer without the presence of Cross also renders the latter a hazy blur, difficult to identify let alone empathise with. And that is despite the best efforts of Renner, who cannot be faulted for not trying his best to fill Damon's shoes. Renner does his best with a thinly written part – you can see his dedication to making the hand- to-hand combat sequences thrilling – but without a compelling backstory, his Cross never quite becomes more than a stock type. Those looking for the same level of adrenaline-kicking excitement as 'Ultimatum' will be severely let down – the action sequences here pack less oomph, take too long to get from one to the other, and are often over too quickly. The one and only sequence worth mentioning is the climax earlier described, and derivative as it is, it is the closest that the film comes to matching the same white-knuckle thrills that the previous movie packed in generous amounts. Of course, 'The Bourne Legacy' is also an unfortunate victim of its predecessor's expectations. Yes, the past three films were definitive in shaking (and we do mean this literally) up the espionage genre with pulse-pounding action, in no small part thanks to Greengrass' fast-cut hand-held camera-work that has since been copied ad infinitum. Coming after the legacy of these films, this serviceable action thriller is a letdown, with little of the exhilaration nor the intelligence that made its predecessors so iconic. Truly, it says a lot when you realise how much you miss Bourne every time a picture or reference to him is made in this movie.

Since Matt Damon decided not to reprise his role as Jason Bourne the filmmakers decided to continue the Bourne franchise without him- the result is the Bourne Legacy. Although it has less action than Damon's earlier trilogy it is still quite entertaining and proceeds along a breakneck pace, never slowing down to be boring and is a welcome addition to the Bourne franchise.Jeremy Renner takes over as lead protagonist Aaron Cross but Damon's presence is constantly being reminded to us since the previous supporting cast from the Bourne Ultimatum (Albert Finney, Scott Glenn, David Strathairn and Joan Allen) all make cameos to make sure that we are firmly within the same universe. In fact the whole movie's timeline takes place at roughly the same time as the Bourne Ultimatum and the constant narrative shifts makes one even anticipate a Matt Damon cameo.So what's the story about? Well it seems that Jason Bourne wasn't the only assassin in the Treadstone project but now it is revealed that there were other projects beside that one too. Because of the public fallout with the Jason Bourne expose the powers that be decide to shut down these other projects by killing everyone involved. Naturally Renner survives and with the help of surviving scientist Rachel Weisz tries to make sense of it all before they themselves are killed.Renner's assassin is slightly different than Damon's since he is neither conflicted nor does he have amnesia but is instead addicted to some sort of blue pills that makes him more deadly. Jeremy Renner does an able job filling in for Matt Damon and the plot and action whirls fast enough to satisfy most moviegoers (though a workplace shooting may hit too close to home for some) but the younger crowd might bemoan the lack of constant massive explosions. For everyone else, its good enough to warrant more. The only weakness is that the ending is somewhat abrupt and seems to hint at a sequel due to a number of unresolved plot and character issues.Here's to hoping Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner teams up in the future with another Bourne movie!

I went to go see an early screening last night and I walked out the cinema confused, not a the plot, but what the entire point of the movie was.It seemed to me that the director didn't put much thought into the film, which lacked depth and another typical action thriller with a poor ending.I would give this a 5 rating but I'm not rounding up. Jeremy Renner is a decent actor and I think the film let him down, the sequel, prequel etc etc has run its course and killed off. But I'm sure it won't be as they've tried so hard to kill Jason Bourne and now this new guy and it'll never happen.Enjoy the movie!...

It takes a bit to get on-track, but once it does, it takes off. I thought the pacing of the screenplay was quite good. The slow spots had plenty of tension, there are plenty of twists in the plot line (maybe a bit too much at times), but once the pedal hit the metal, you're in for a great ride. Great editing during the chase scenes. It's tough to replace Matt Damon, but Jeremy Renner does a good job, along with a surprisingly fine acting performance by Rachel Weisz. I wasn't sure what to expect, considering The Bourne Ultimatum seemed to wrap everything up into a bow, but this one surprised me and left me satisfied (and exhausted).

I had real doubts about the making of a Bourne film without Matt Damon , & worried seriously that the trilogy that I loved so much (miles better than Bond) would be tarnished. Then I saw the cast the trailers & read some early reviews so thought hang on this might not be as bad as I thought. My wife who hasn't seen any of the previous three went with me to a free screening & obviously didn't understand many of the references to Jason Bourne or the links to previous films , but stuck with it anyway. The cast gave it a reasonable go on what was at best an average script that was like a recycled version of the previous films. It was very muddled at the beginning hoping around trying to establish a plot. The action felt rehashed for example the big chase in Manila at the end of the film has been done before & much better as in the Moscow chase in the Bourne supremacy. The same applies for the assassin sent to kill Cross , done better in all the previous films. It is hopefully time to close the Bourne franchise unless Matt can be talked out for one last go. Jeremy Renner & Rachel Weisz gave it their best but this ain't no legacy , & whilst not a bad movie its not in the same league as the previous three.

Wasn't sure what to expect from this one at all? Didn't initially see the need for another Bourne film after the trilogy with Matt Damon but I read that there was a fourth book and my curiosity was piqued. I wasn't at all familiar with Jeremy Renner at this time so it seemed like a clean slate to me. I've subsequently seen Renner in both Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol and The Avengers and loved both movies and his performance in them.Even arriving at the cinema and sitting down to watch this I had literally no idea what to expect. I was, I am relieved to say, pleasantly surprised. Renner's Aaron Cross is a fine new character and the plot is good, there are a few clever moments.There isn't as much action as there is in Ultimatum , the action quota is higher than Supremacy and Identity and the action scenes are, as to be expected, excellent.Never been a huge fan of Rachel Weisz but she was good in this. The irony that she is married to Daniel Craig is quite amusing.In short I enjoyed this and hope for a fifth film in the series.

The first Bourne trilogy transcends the action movie genre. They are fast and clever. Showing us the intense fist fights and exciting car chases in a new way. It's a remarkable thing. It's so remarkable, many action films intends to copy its style. This fourth movie, The Bourne Legacy, may not have Matt Damon in it but we are expecting it to have the legacy of the first three. Unfortunately, we don't get to see a lot of it, but by its slick direction, great performances, and thrilling set pieces, it made the film worth a ride.The Bourne Legacy is straightforward to its storytelling, but unlike the first three, this is not quite swift. The exposition mostly leans on the dialogue. Disappointingly, it is not as action packed as the usual Bourne films. The action only shows up in some parts, but when it goes there, it becomes a lot more entertaining. They may be few but all of them are thrillingly exciting.It could have been a little shorter, though. The runtime feels like a stretch. But thanks to the director and the actors for making sure that things won't go dull. Jeremy Renner has the looks of an action hero. Some will say he's just a generic bland actor but they didn't realize that there is a hidden talent in him. He can do more than just physicality. He actually gave more personality to his role. The director seem to slow things down, but he keeps the non-action scenarios gripping.It's practically reasonable why some did not like The Bourne Legacy. The major reason is the element that made the series remarkable is rare in this film. We didn't see anything fast and ridiculous until the third act. But if you have more desire to know the other story behind The Bourne Ultimatum then this will keep you interested. In general, The Bourne Legacy is as gripping as the others. It's true that the main legacy of the series is little here, but if you are not concern about it then you'll think this as a decent blockbuster.

Four years after the release of the original trilogy, the Bourne franchise paves its way to the silver screen once again. Admittedly, I too as with most fans was unsure whether the film would be able to stand up to its predecessors but indeed, it was a very immediate and immature response.  The opening shot made it seem that it would start where 'The Bourne Ultimatum' left of, a brilliant trick to say the least. The setting of the film is actually in coherence to that of the previous film, it actually used some of its segments to displace the time of the events occurring in 'Legacy'. Jeremy Renner, did what he does best, as we can remember him from his most recent movie 'Mission: Impossible' as a more lively and dynamic counterpart for Matt Damon's Jason Bourne. Renner was flawless in his character proving the original assumptions as whether he could pull it off completely wrong. Rachel Wiesz and Edward Norton with a piece of the whole film dedicated to them and the structuring of their characters were as crucial and pivotal to the development of the entire narrative.The film stays true to its roots as to its narrative structure, the government, the lead female character, and the car chase scene, in this case, a motorbike race in the busy, crowded streets of Manila. Robert Elswit made the most out of the film to showcase the intensity of the story with the wonderful cinematography, living in Manila myself, I could only imagine the work and imagination it took for him and the whole crew to device the film's trademark chase scene. Kudos as well to Tony Gilroy, for not succumbing to the generic-one way story films these days rely on.'The Bourne Legacy' is not as character driven as the previous trilogy rather, it mainly dedicates itself to the completion and delivery of the whole concept of the Bourne franchise. The issue regarding the fact that there were too many characters, too many actors to focus on is essential in building the while story. In the end, as it delivers  the bittersweet closure for the original trilogy, it opens up a new and fresh chapter for itself.

Not as exciting as any of the first three films. Even though Jeremy Renner gave a fine performance that for me is still considered below Matt Damon's, the whole movie is lesser, in the plot, in the writing, in style, in wit, and in almost every way you look at it. The second part of the movie became totally different, and it was packed by chase scenes that just wanted to fill in for the last few minutes of the movie. For me it didn't felt like a "Bourne" movie. I was really looking up for Tony Gilroy who had brilliantly written the three films, they wanted to equal the first Bourne films but they fell short. In my opinion, the weakest in the series. Please no more unnecessary sequels.

Written by the Gilroy brothers Dan and director Tony, with the latter having screenplay responsibilities for the earlier Bourne films as well, they had set up Legacy to tangent off from Ultimatum, with the beginning here taking place some 6 weeks before Ultimatum's, and running in a parallel timeline. The return of characters both major and minor in cameo appearances convince we're still in the same universe, and dealing with similar shady secret operatives who are hell bent at containing the damage that Jason Bourne is out to do through his expose of all the clandestine projects under the CIA. Rather than close the doors revolving round the possibility of Jason Bourne's return, Legacy had set it up so that the next film, if it happens, has more doors opened up for the narrative to move forward.But for now the first hour can be extremely dry, as we take many steps back to see the earlier stages of the programme that Jason Bourne was put under, with the guinea pigs at various stages of experimentation, who remain dependent on the regular drug doses they have to take to maintain their super soldier abilities with heightened senses and physicality. We get introduced to Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross, who's also on the project, and learn of the existence of many others, who are all on the crosshairs of the agencies they serve, in order to kill them off for the longevity of the programmes they are put under. Led by Edward Norton's Retired Col. Eric Byer who's brought in to contain the situation and threat that Jason Bourne is posing, Aaron Cross outwits them through an episode taken a leaf out of Grey, allowing us some man versus drone plane action sequences that set up Cross to be quite a formidable Bourne clone.The introduction of Rachel Weisz' Dr Marta Shearing was in essence to provide for a Marie type character whom Cross can run around cities with in escape from their hunters, but more importantly to serve as a link to the drug formulation used to turn those in the programme into formidable assassins, being one of many scientists involved in genetic research, which as usual, comes with the deliberate weaponization from new research. To add to the story, how anyone can get to the level of Jason Bourne's expertise is given an explanation here, which is something yet to be explored in detail until now. One thing's for sure, the role is not one that's the typical damsel in distress, although being involved in a deliberate massacre may trigger some negative reactions in light of what had happened in the USA. It's one of the better stand out, though more harrowing scene in the movie, which may undoubtedly strike too close to home for the Americans, and the box office.Jeremy Renner's stock had risen in recent years after The Hurt Locker, with involvement in steady franchises such as Mission: Impossible, and Marvel's comic book films, and whether or not he'll take over Tom Cruise for further M:I adventures remain to be seen. But he's already cementing his role as Aaron Cross, and looks set to take the Bourne movies forward, even if there are rumours of a pairing with Damon for the next film. Renner worked the action sequences with aplomb, whether it calls for fisticuffs, rooftop chases or spectacularly weaving dangerously through Manila's traffic on a motorbike, and is convincing as an ex- army operative turned guinea pig who now has to bite the hand that fed it, constantly on the move in order to stay alive. It's early in his story arc, and it may seem Cross is on the backtrack for the most parts, so it would be interesting if, like Bourne, he's allowed to take the fight back to his hunters.It took about 60 minutes before The Bourne Legacy exploded into life, and swung into the high gear formula its predecessors have been known for, but without the shaky cam cinematography that alienated and irritated some. Tony Gilroy decided to go for traditional techniques without being too flashy, which served well. Familiar ingredients defining the Bourne movies continue here, with the jet-setting, cat and mouse chases, and battle of wits. Protocol also comes in the form of the hunt being commanded from a control room setting in which Norton's Eric barks orders, and the multitude of ground work and effort going into tracking the needle in the haystack which is Cross and Marta. It's the hunter who becomes the prey, and vice versa reversal of roles, that has Legacy continue the good work set up by the initial trilogy.If you'd take a step back, The Bourne Legacy had really kept it simple by introducing a slightly different premise than we're already familiar with, which in tongue and cheek fashion, went on to have the patient seek out his doctor for more medication, only to be brought to the factory for the drugs he requires, and an effort made to be weaned off. All these, with their employers hot on their tracks in order to finish them off, and keep their clandestine projects under wraps. It may not be the best film of the franchise given that it's the beginning of another, and had dwelled a little longer to have everything set up, but once it got its act together, the adrenaline never stopped pumping. It's also interesting to note how many variations of Extreme Ways can Moby come up with! Highly recommended!

The good news is that there's another sequel in the exciting hit espionage series that starred Matt Damon as the superspy who didn't know he was one, based on widely-read novels by genre master Robert Ludlum. The bad news is that neither the author nor the star had anything to do with this production. Instead we get Jeremy Renner as the next generation of chemically-enhanced operatives after Mr. Bourne, working from a story written and directed by Tony Gilroy. Based on this evidence, it's hard to believe Gilroy adapted the first three novels into such successful screenplays, since this spin off is, above all else, so dull.The hush-hush program our intelligence services devised to create agents like Bourne is under fire, with leaks about its sordid activities about to cause a storm of backlash. The honchos scramble to destroy all evidence of what they did and how they did it, including silencing the unveilers with, as they supposedly say in the biz, extreme prejudice. Renner is the one who gets away, threatening international disgrace, and a whole bunch of careers. Those with power rarely give it up willingly. So Renner's on the run through a globe-trotting series of action scenes that never manage to add up to the thrillfest we've come to expect from this franchise.The first hour is confusing, with so many players briefly shown in so many parts of the world, and far too much dialog for the amount of action. Renner is even stiffer than usual. Some of that is consistent with his character's training, but it still makes a less compelling bond with viewers than the norm for heroes in such flicks. Gilroy is also wanting as a director (his first high-octane venture, after the relatively cerebral Duplicity and Michael Clayton), deriving less payoff in the chases and fights than he should have wrung from the budget and assets on his sets. Among the big summer action epics thus far, this one ranks as the most disappointing.

"The Bourne Legacy" has so much hype in my country not only because it rides on the coattails of the amazing Bourne Trilogy starring Matt Damon. Even more significantly, it is due to the fact that a considerable number of scenes had been shot right here locally, in such places as the San Andres Market, the Pasay Rotonda, the Navotas Fishport and Palawan. The shooting of the movie was front page news and was on the daily evening news shows. When the trailer showing the Manila scenes was released, it trended massively on online social networking sites. Everything pointed to a widely successful August 8, 2012 opening date. Unfortunately though, Mother Nature had other ideas, as one of the metropolis' worst monsoon flooding which inundated many parts of the city happened before and right on that day. All of a sudden, "The Bourne Legacy" did not seem that important anymore.I personally felt that this movie, while very exciting at parts, did not really live up to the quality of the first three Bourne movies. The lead actors Jeremy Renner (as Treadstone Agent Aaron Cross) and Rachel Weiss (as geneticist-virologist Dr. Marta Shearer) did very well in the acting department to keep the scenes vital. However, the story (for a Bourne movie) was uncharacteristically sketchy and really, barely there.This film follows the aftermath of the third Bourne film when his agency Treadstone was already being investigated and threatened with exposure. All remaining Treadstone agents were being systematically eradicated. Cross and Shearer have to evade the government counter forces led by Eric Byer (Edward Norton), who did not really feel like a real danger for our heroes. We learn the "scientific" reason why Treadstone agents have super-human abilities, which was too incredible. The Manila connection was weak and unbelievable. The street chase scenes in Manila were a big blur, and basically what we already saw in the trailer. The ending felt rushed and too convenient. If you knew Philippine geography, the final scenes would be funny.I don't know, but I think I simply expected too much from this movie. It has all the Bourne elements there, but it felt lacking. It was only the charisma and talent of the stars that carried the film. I was disappointed that it did not really show anything iconically Filipino to represent the country. I don't think the "jeepney" really counts. The slums used could have been any slum in the world. Nothing really positive about the Manila or its people was shown, which was a letdown. If ever there is a sequel though, I would still watch if only for Renner and Weisz, and maybe to find out what else can be done to liven up this series. I would not really count on that sequel too soon though.

AARON Cross is one tough guy. We know that because the flick shows us freezing his ass out in some godforsaken part of the US. We know that he can jump, climb and shoot with great skill, which make me wonder if he should have been an Olympic athlete instead of an assassin.The movie then abruptly shifts to office politics and discursive yak-yak that should not predominate an action flick. Viewers won't care for that. They come to a Bourne flick for the action.That said, the first movie showed a great romance between Bourne and his girlfriend. In this flick, it's forced and contrived.The doctor killing his colleagues brings back memories of last month's Colorado theater shooting and this week's massacre of 6 people in a US Sikh temple. The scene may have been an inadvertent one, but that's what viewers will think about when they are watching the movie.Cross may have the same killing talent as Jason Bourne, but he definitely doesn't share the latter's enigma, coolness and debonair quality.We get to see lots of shootings, driving, making fake ID cards and breaking into a Manila installation. Nothing new.The flick's piece de resistance is the chase across rooftops in a Manila slum, running in narrow alleys, jumping off bridges and a motorcycle chase.Is this a Bourne flick or another run of the mill flick?This movie doesn't bode well for the Bourne franchise. Where art thou, Matt Damon?

Been there and done that.You basically have a buncha Pamela Landy types walking around a bunker somewhere talking spy, while you have another Bourne type character being chased around by yet another nemesis assassin? Seem a little familiar? This is the same soup, but with different mixins.With that said though, the acting was good enough, and the fight scenes and chase scene at the end were good.Come into this movie with a mindset that you are looking for a Bourne/Spy type movie that brings something new to the table, you will leave disappointed, but if you aren't picky and just need a weekend spy thriller, then this will do the trick.

The Bourne Legacy comes five years after Ultimatum: Bourne has exposed Blackbriar and it starts crumbling at the seems. Enter Aaron Cross, another agent from Operation Outcome attempts to outrun those who created him. Cross is, unfortunately, boring. Jeremy Renner attempts to make do with what he's given, but Bourne would kill Cross if they ever met face to face.The project attracted big names such as Renner, Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton, as well as returning cast Joan Allen and David Strathairn, but they only appear in 5 minute long cameos. The glaring issue is Jason Bourne is not in this, something i knew wouldn't work. With Bourne, it feels forced, and it was.Another missing attribute was John Powell's power surged score, Oliver Wood's realistic cinematography and Christopher Rouse's sharp editing. Everything about the film feels uninspired, with the only intention being "gotta cash in, gotta cash in."To it's credit, it maintains it action grit and slick car chases, but outside of that, Legacy falls flat and fails to make people believe Cross is better than Jason Bourne. Then again, that was a crazy idea to begin with.Perhaps this convinces Greengrass and Damon to return to their respected posts. And maybe squeeze Aaron Cross in.The Bourne Legacy 5/10

Apparently Jason Bourne really isn't special enough to make another quality movie about him, as the story telling takes off in too many directions. True it was only last week, but not since the Total Recall have I been so disappointed in a movie. With these two examples, Hollywood is presently destroying some perfectly good concepts. Probably trying to pull a slick one, the writer(s) tried to use the spirit of the Bourne story, to plant lots of Easter Eggs, which simply exploded in the viewers face. As if in covert style, this effort harms the franchise from which it is trying to escape. While there is some of it throughout, the action sequence (the absence of an 's' to end the last word is not by mistake), which the regular fan is used to, doesn't happen until much too late in the movie. If you want to accept this as Jason Bourne's legacy, this movie leaves too many things undone, and in my opinion The Bourne Legacy should not include any reference to Jason Bourne in the title.

Set on the backdrop of the search for Jason Bourne, Aaron Cross and his group of drug enhanced secret operatives are put on a hit list when their programme is closed down. Thought dead and dependant on experimental drugs he seeks the assistance of marked for death lab doctor who knows of the governments operations.Jeremy Renner despite being type cast yet again as a crack shot (28 Days Later, Avengers Assemble, The Hurt Locker) holds the lead as Aaron Cross well. With a smudge of James Belushi and intensity and execution of Daniel Craig's 007 Renner handles the drama and fight scenes of the former soldier, now super operative superbly with ease. The opening scene carry much of the tension and suspense as Cross meets up with his counterpart and tries to escape wolves and a bombing drone. There's breathtaking action, notably a bike chase, which is fast paced and wonderfully shot by director/writer Tony Gilroy.Continuing the series tradition with a cast of heavy weights, Edward Norton and the marvellous Stacy Keach put in first-rate appearances. Rachel Weisz is on form as Marta Shearing and carries the emotion during the events of Legacy, her arc feels genuine especially as her and Cross' friendship develops. While former cast members including Scott Glenn, Albert Finney and Joan Allen are reduced to cameos, video footage and photos which link the series. These connections are significant as the story runs parallel to Bourne's conclusion.Nevertheless, Legacy follows The Bourne Identity's format a little much to the letter, scenes are reminiscent of the first outing. It lacks the intrigue of the others and is less than subtle in referencing Damon's outings. The ending feels abrupt but welcoming as it sets up an inevitable sequel that hopefully won't follow the retread the same ground as The Bourne Supremacy.There's less espionage, more action with enough surprises to keep the legacy alive although it does tread some same stones.

Either I'm insane, or I saw a different movie from the one that so many reviewers seem to like, especially on IMDb. This was easily the most boring and intensely stupid action film I've seen since Total Recall a week before. Take every spy film cliché you can think of, take every absurdly terrible and confusing action scene you can picture, and combine it with an awkward and hilariously poorly-thought-out sci- fi twist about pills and drugs, and 'viralling-off' the pills Aaron need to take. Seriously, the best shot of the film due to its incredible comedic value, was probably the one where the top secret agency guys figure out what the main characters are doing in Manila. The stereotypical nerd looks shocked and says, "The stem cells..." his eyes widening in disbelief, turning to his buddy who says, "They're going to try and viral him off!" Dun dun dun! Viral ... him ... off. Oookay. Did I mention that at the beginning of EVERY scene they find it necessary to include a hugely intense bass-heavy musical score, and usually a long distance tracking-over-the-city shot? Every scene.The plot is about as interesting as a dead cat on the street. A dead cat that was run over and then beaten to pulp by a tyrannical three-year-old with a baseball bat. The big bad bosses -- who are actually trying to save the USA and their own asses -- in their top secret rooms decide to shut down the program. They kill everyone, particularly brutal in the only scene that made me feel anything other than amusement: the cold-blooded lab murder scene which is particularly disturbing because it's so heavy and out of place in such a silly, light-hearted film. And then Aaron survives the program-wide killings, as does the Doc. And then they find him chemicals/viral him off in Manila with the help of the hot Doc. The End. For real. That's it. The only thing that consoled me in the terrible trail-off cliff-hanger ending was that the film was FINALLY over. Because despite the awful, short plot they find it necessary to drag every scene out, including a god-awfully long scene in the hot Doc's big house. The bad- guys had machine guns, for Christ's sake. Why the hell would they need to search the house for her handgun, and then try and wrestle her down before killing her? Just f***ing shoot her once you've found out that she didn't tell anybody, for the love of God! I could be a better hit-squad. By myself. With a normal pistol.And again, despite the relative simplicity of the plot at its core, the script tries to cover it up with layer after layer of complex and intense scenes, which makes it seem a whole lot more complicated than it really is. It doesn't change anything, it makes it worse. Oh, and suddenly at the end some Thai guy out of nowhere, who's actually also a super agent without all the bad stuff like empathy removed, decides to join in the fray. As if they threw it in afterward just to give Aaron a tangible antagonist that he could shoot. I think the Thai agent says about 0 words, and has the personality of a stick or rock with a painted face on.A lot of people have spoken about how the actor for the two lead characters salvaged the film. Sure, they're fine actors. They don't salvage the film. They just make their own intensity seem clichéd and cheesy. Their characters are about as transparent as an exceedingly clean window, so that doesn't help them.And the action scenes. Fair enough, there's some decent martial arts and all that stuff with the drones, blah blah. The scene in the house was OK. What really angered me, what made me dizzy with annoyance and frustration that the film was still happening, was the terribly filmed action scenes with the vehicles. I'm young, and my eyes are OK. I think I might be slightly mentally retarded though, because I can't follow the fast-paced action scenes in Manila for my life. They gave a two-year old who could just about walk, an HD camera on the end of a piece of string, and told him to waddle around swinging the camera. That's what the filming is like. I'm surprised I didn't see a toothless mouth try and eat the lens. All that movement, all that action, it's supposed to make you feel intensely INTO the film, like you're part of the action. It makes me feel like I have no idea what is going on and I'm not supposed to, because the action scene is excessively long and has no point, and the film-makers are just trying to cover it up with terrible shots. Yes, some scenes were intelligible, probably (I switched off after a while so I can't be sure).Oh, and in the End, like I said, they get away just fine and dandy. The End. See you next time in part 5 of whatever we can milk out of you suckers next.

I went into the Bourne Legacy with no expectations whatsoever. The critics' review of the film were so all over the place that I had no idea whether I would be royally entertained or bitterly disappointed. In the event, I was royally entertained. I loved the intricate backstory explaining how Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) came to be such a super warrior and the complications that came with it. I thought Renner's work here was the best he has done since his memorable performance in The Hurt Locker. The film's production values could hardly have been higher. I gave high marks to its colorful locations, fine cinematography, and brilliant ensemble cast. The producers took care to cast fine actors such as David Strathairn and Elizabeth Marvel in small roles. As usual, Rachel Weisz was marvelous, although I barely recognized her at first. It appears that she has had some cosmetic surgery, which, while leaving her still beautiful, changed her looks. No matter, she was still fine. After the, to me at least, very interesting exposition of the background of the Outcome subjects, the movie shifted into high gear, with heart stopping chases, on both foot and motorcycle, through the streets of Manilla.Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross in The Bourne Legacy is a worthy successor to Matt Damon's Jason Bourne in The Bourne Trilogy. 8 Stars out of 10.

I left from my office and decided to watch first show at night with my friends. When I entered Movie hall, I had high expectation from movie and from Tony Gilroy as Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are new additions to series but as movie went on I started searching for that "Bourne" factor and never found it.Pros: Good acting by both lead. Good cinematographyCons: Fails to keep expectations Character of Aron Cross is not portrayed well.Background music is dull (earlier movies had good music) While Jason Bourne tries to take down CIA, Aron Cross is trying to run away from it (Why?)You will never feel like watching a Bourne series movie (except when they mention news about Jason Bourne and Pam Landy in middle)

Jason Bourne is one of the more intriguing film characters of the past decade. He methodically and purposefully found out who he was, who was responsible for his condition, and attempted to bring everything back together again. Even better, he was not a superhero; Jason was just a guy who went through a lot of training. He is elite, but deep down he is still one of us. Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), on the other hand, has been tweaked a little bit. He pops pills to up his physical and mental skills. Yes, he is still human too, but perhaps a bit genetically modified. This splash of sci/fi does not help an audience tuned in to the adventures of Jason Bourne connect with the new guy.When I first heard there was another Bourne installment, this time without Matt Damon, I figured someone either wrote a good script to carry on a new story line, or the studio wanted to churn out a guaranteed cash cow under the title of a proved and successful action series. Writer/director Tony Gilroy wrote the scripts for the first three Bourne films, but this is his first time behind the camera in the series. He successfully directed Michael Clayton and the under- appreciated Duplicity, but now the magic is gone. The Bourne Legacy is stale. Enduring a painfully slow beginning, The Bourne Legacy reveals it is set at the same point in time as The Bourne Ultimatum. In fact, if you have forgotten the plot points and supporting characters of the previous film, take the time to either watch it again or read about it online before heading into the new feature. Jason Bourne's escapades have thrown multiple CIA operations out in the open and the shadowy powers are frantically trying to sweep them under the rug before either Congress or the press start asking questions. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) orders the termination of Project Outcome, the new series of super agent represented by Aaron Cross. Instead of telling the agents to pack up and go home, the CIA chooses to assassinate them instead. Oh, and they try to wipe out all of the scientists who made them so super in the first place.Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) is one of those scientists seeking ways to alter chromosomes to make a more perfect human. After surviving annihilation himself, Aaron conveniently scoops the good Dr. out of harms way which sets up an 'us against them' theme quite similar to the one you remember from The Bourne Identity. Unfortunately, The Bourne Legacy noticeably lacks the quality script and thrilling action sequences of that first film. The chase scenes in the new film are edited so atrociously, especially during motorcycle elements, that they are almost impossible to logically follow. You know they are weaving in and out of traffic, there are near misses, and flying bullets; but there are only quick glimpses of that on the screen in the midst of the unsteady camera work and split-second jump cuts.The Bourne Identity also had a mystery to unravel and wandered around the world trying to find out who was behind the curtain. There is no curtain now, Edward Norton is pulling the strings in plain sight using all of the means in the intelligence community he can lay his hands on. There are armed Predator drones, devious mop-up CIA killing squads, and even a possible super- duper agent; imagine the Schwarzenegger Terminator battling the new T-1000. Renner and Weisz do their best to remake a film which was already pretty great. Yes, they have new names and faces, but they are running from the same agency, dodging the same bullets, but this time they have a higher chromosomal level on their side. The Bourne Legacy will be known as that film which derailed the very respectable Bourne franchise. Paul Greengrass, the director of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, was correct when he said any further film would feel like The Bourne Redundancy.

..just got back from seeing this one...I've enjoyed all of the previous Bourne films, but went into this one with some lowered expectations due to the August release date (this is usually trash time). I have to say i came out thoroughly impressed with the effort that was put forward. It's a very solid entry in the Bourne series.The action sequences are intense and top notch, one sequence in particular that takes place in a science lab was actually fairly harrowing.. You could hear a pin drop in the theatre. There's some very good acting from Rachel Weisz there. Jeremy Renner does a solid job stepping into the lead (though this is a different character from Jason Bourne.) Edward Norton, as always, gives a great performance as the government head hounding our heroes.Overall, a very solid summer flick. Worth checking out if you enjoyed the previous films.

Ouch. I wish Greengrass directed this film, because to me it felt like a mess. Had a good idea with a solid backing, but it failed to take advantage of it. I like that they intertwined the story within the Ultimatum storyline like you see in the preview as well as playing homage to the original series, but the execution sucked not to mention that the Bourne events had no influence on Cross' character - something that "Legacy" would suggest. The storytelling felt disjointed, and the action sequences had way too much camera shake to enjoy them (the first trilogy wasn't so bad). Other than Manila, and the solitude of Alaska, location is one trademark of the legacy that just wasn't there. In the first three films, the assassins didn't need to speak to have personality and character - this film's assassin was just a ghost in your memory.Even though not directly stated, I think most people would understand by watching this film what MAY have actually happened to Jason Bourne. The only way this film will have any more meaning is if they continue the new trilogy.

Going to the midnight showing of The Bourne Legacy I wasn't expecting much, but was hoping to be pleasantly surprised like I had with other movies I've had doubts with. Like I had doubts with when I went to see the Bourne Identity, but before I get to my opinion of the film I must first talk about the films that came before. After all Legacy is a continuation and a direct sequel to the Bourne films, so I must first talk about the previous films a little first. Back in 2001 and 2002 leading up to the Bourne Identity I had only remembered seeing Matt Damon in Saving Private Ryan and Good Will Hunting nor had I heard of the books Identity was based off of, so I had my doubts about the film. Still I took a chance and was happily surprised. The Bourne Identity was a great film. The action wasn't over the top like much of the action films of the 1980's and 1990's. It had a unique story, which at the time I don't remember it having been done like it had with this film. The characters were interesting, and the music was great. The film led me to Robert Ludlum novels the film was based off of. I read his three Bourne novels and I must admit I enjoyed the Identity and the rest of the films more then I like the novels. Right now I can only think of one other time that has happened, and it was with The Lord of the Ring series. I enjoyed the novels, but they were truly great books. The films on the other hand were great especially the first two. When The Bourne Supremacy came out in 2004 I had no doubts about the film or Mat Damon this time. It was a great film, and that was even with them killing of Marie an important character from the books and a character I liked. That's how good Supremacy was for me, and who could forget the car chase seen in Moscow with Karl Urban. It's one of the best car chases scenes of all time along with the likes of Bullitt, The French Connection, Ronin and The Road Warrior. When The Bourne Ultimatum came out in 2007 it had a lot to live up to, and through I thought it would be good I didn't think it could surpass Supremacy, but again I was wrong. Ultimatum was as good if not better than its predecessor. That's a rarity in films and franchises for a third sequel to be as good if not better than the film that came before. Right now I can only think of a few films like The Revenge of the Sith, The Dark Knight Rises and Alien 3. Ultimatum was a great film and had a good ending. I know the studio and director left an opening for another film, but in my opinion they should had let sleeping dogs lie. Robert Ludlum had stopped writing Bourne novels back in 1990. I know Eric Van Lustbader is a capable writer, but Ludlum had finished Bourne's journey and the novels feel forced. Matt Damon was moving on, and so was Paul Greengrass. If Universal really wanted to continue with the franchise it should have gotten down on its hands and knees and begged those two to come back, and pay them whatever they wanted. You can see why I had my doubts about Legacy. Still with that being said I'd still gave it a chance like I had with Matt Damon and Identity back in 2002, which leads us to Bourne Legacy.Where to begin? Where to begin? I could start with the lackluster action, the uninteresting characters. No I'll start with the forced story. When I saw the trailers it looked like they were trying to turn Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) into some kind of super soldier. If I want to see a movie with super heroes in it I'd go to see any of the super hero films that come out every few months now a days. That was what was so good about the Bourne films. Sure Jason Bourne was government trained killer, but he was still human, and could get hurt. It's one of the reason's the films were so good. In Legacy they tried to destroy what was so good about the previous films with the story about genetics and drugs turning people into super soldiers. Then there is Gilory trying to force his failed story into the Bourne universe. It's like a child trying to force a square peg into a round opening it just isn't going to work. That's what it feels like in this film as director and writer Gilory tries to force his story with Bourne's. Sure Gilory was the writer for the previous films, but he had inspiration from Ludlum's books. If he created this screenplay on his own then he needs to stick to adapting screenplays from novels, because he can't do it on his own. Maybe Universal forced him to do it this way after all I know they were desperate to keep this franchise going. If so then I can forgive him for his lackluster to bad screen play. The only thing or person that truly saves the story is Aaron Cross. His story is compelling especially how he came to be part of the program and who he was before it. The character kept me interested in the film.Sorry I'm not posting my full review, but IMDb doesn't let users post reviews with more then a thousand words for some reason.

CONTAINS SPOILERS The original Bourne flick starts with Jason Bourne suffering amnesia and seeking hi identity, such search leading him to question his ethics and morals prior to the amnesia. Kind of cliché, but it works.The Bourne Legacy has no such deep meaning: Aaron Cross isn't searching for "reasons why". He's simply trying to stay a step or two ahead of the spy masters.On the other hand the lack of Raison d'être did not occur to me until after I left the theater. The movie is well thought out, well acted, & well shot. It really does have everything except deeper meaning. The fight scenes are good and the chase scene at the end is fantastic (a hallmark of the Bourne series). The spy masters are portrayed as true believers of their cause, which somewhat removes them from 'obvious bad guys' as we are often accustomed in movies, but does provide a fuller characterization of why the hard choices are made than was attempted in previous Bourne films. Edward Norton and Rachel Weisz both deliver excellent support performances.I recommend this film.

Went to the midnight premier with four buddies. When the movie ended we all looked at each other with surprised confused looks. We were like, WHAT?If this movie was called, "Government Conspiracy" and not "The Bourne Legacy", and all the names were different, and if you did not compare it to the first two Bourne movies; it would be a pretty good movie. I liked the acting in it and the cinematography was much better then the "Hand Held video cam" style of the Ultimatum.Paul Greengrass hit the nail on the head when he said that a fourth Bourne movie should be called "The Bourne Redundancy". Honestly, I know I could write a better story line for a Bourne squeal. One that at least adds some redeeming value to the Bourne story and that does not leave you feeling like you just watched a spy version of Alice versus the Evil Umbrella Corporation in Resident Evil.The bottom line is this movie beats the same dead horse of a story line that died in The Bourne Supremacy and it starts more story lines then it ends. It was just made to lead in to a sequel. Unfortunately, I don't think it will do well enough to justify making a sequel and we will be left forever wondering how the story ends.

Film: The Bourne Legacy Studio: Relativity Media, The Kennedy /Marshall Company Cast: Jeremy Renner, Edward Norton, Rachel Weisz Rating: PG-13 Running Time:135 minutesIn 2002 Jason Bourne the amnesiac spy/assassin loosely based off of the Robert Ludlem novels made his way to the big screen. Played magnificently by Matt Damon, The Bourne Identity was a breath of fresh air in the action-thriller genre which had been dominated by movies like "Mission: Impossible" and the James Bond series. In the following years, two sequels (The Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum) also starring Damon came along, each tolerable in their own right, both feeding off of the previous story but neither as good as the first.Eventually the quality of the of the scripts were of such poor quality that even Matt Damon distanced himself and moved on from the franchise.  If only the studio made the same move. Supposedly Paul Greengrass, the director of the first three Bourne installments joked about a forth film being titled "The Bourne Redundancy"which turns out to be ironically appropriate. I submit the even more appropriate "The Boring Legacy".Directed by Tony Gilroy, writer of the first three Bourne films, The Bourne Legacy struggles to introduce new characters and attach them to the established narrative. In a nutshell, we learn that the covert program that created Jason Bourne has a sister program run by another clandestine government agency like the CIA. The head of that agency (The Incredible Hulk's Edward Norton) is positive that the events of "Supremacy" have created an infection which needs to be"cleaned up" - a euphemism for killing all agents involved in the "Outcome" program. Aaron Cross (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner) is the last of these Bourne-like agents who are  dependent on a combination of pills to maintain their amazing physical and mental skills. He's knows he's being hunted but desperately wants to obtain a refill so not to lose his lethal abilities. Bored yet?  I felt the same way watching. He teams up with a reluctant biologist (Rachel Wiesz) who helped engineer and administrate the "Outcome" agents and program who is also marked for "cleansing" as the rest of her team is massacred in a workplace shooting that was frankly, extremely uncomfortable to watch in light of the recent real-life mass murders in Colorado and Wisconsin. What made the first Bourne film so captivating was the intriguing plot that accompanied Bourne's amnesia laced with the action sequences that showcased his innate abilities to assess a situation and appropriately and effortlessly kick ass. And that's precisely where the Bourne Legacy fails. The plot is nothing more than boring and the action scenes not only pale on comparison to and in intensity to Bourne's, Bond's and Hawke's(of Mission: Impossible) they happen so late in the film that they hardly matter since you have literally already seen all of them in the film's trailers. Ironically the tagline to this installment is  "There was never just one." There probably should've been.

Another weekend ,another movie and this time I'm reviewing none other than the latest additions to the Bourne series, the Bourne Legacy. Now while I am a fan of the original trilogy, I had my doubts that a fourth installment would be able to fit in with its predecessors. However, the action I've seen in the trailers for the last few months held some promise that the same adrenaline rushing scenes would be in this movie. So is this Matt Damon lacking sequel worth the hype, or should the series have stayed concluded as was promised years ago? I hope to answer that question below. I guess the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the Bourne series is Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. Well aside from a few photo ideas, and a brief shot of his gun, there is little to do with the agent who caused so much chaos. Although his actions are the cause for the plot of this movie, the movie instead focuses on Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) an agent who has been deemed one of the best agents in his project. Although he has been complacent in his training and missions, the head of the department and new villain Eric Byer (Edward Norton) has decided to clean up their mistakes by eliminating the other Bourne agents. Cross however, manages to elude his captors and soon becomes the prey of the organization alongside one of his creators Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz). Despite what you might be thinking, Cross was a fitting character to enter the series. Like many of his roles, Renner did his homework for this movie and settled into the spy occupation just fine. However, instead of being the elite, stoic, plays by the book agent we saw in Mission Impossible 4 and goes into the rather clever and improvising killer. Renner uses his calm demeanor to ruthlessly execute his victims, which adds a layer of terror and threat to an already dangerous position. The fact that he knows how to deliver his lines with a deep intensity also makes him a little more bad-a$$ than Bourne. Unfortunately the directors decided to also make Cross a drug addict in this movie, so Renner had to practice being a little psychotic dependency as well. Unlike Nicholas Cage's acid trip in Ghost Rider though, Renner happens to act dependent without going overboard. The dependency just makes his mission more urgent and gives his character a weakness to his otherwise superman persona instead of making him do stupid antics that mimic the entire Project X movie. It's a good character development skill, but there could have been other weakness Bourne could have had. As for Weisz, well the actress still has her moves down and still looks stunning in just about every scene with her element withstanding hair. Fans of hers will be happy to see her return in full glory; essentially she is a non-British Evie minus the ancient Egyptian weapons. As for the action of the movie, well there have been some cutbacks in that department. Legacy is a bit slower pace at the beginning focusing on more back story and catch up than actual action. A few shots of Cross' training are interspersed through an opening dialog of readouts, medications, statistics, and of course how deadly Bourne is. The background information that was missing from the first installments was nice to hear as it explained a lot about the political games involved in this project. Even the science made some sense, though a lot of it was Hollywood magic at its finest, but those who don't like the biochemistry jargon and techniques will find it boring. Despite the interesting information though, there was no reason editing couldn't have tightened up the dialog and made some cuts to the two hours and fifteen minute film. You may even find yourself dozing off here or there as you count the minutes until the hunt begins. However once the prolonged introduction is done and the wheels are set into motion, the pace of the film picks up. Cross' skills are even more creative than Bourne's as he uses his superior ingenuity to outsmart his superiors. Those who have seen the trailer may remember the nail trap, but that is just the tip of the iceberg, as Cross has more moves than a DDR dancer. Combine his ingenuity with fast paced kung fu, expert wielding of high powered guns, and a fitting soundtrack to add some depth, and you get some decent action scenes that the world has missed. Perhaps the only thing that could have made the action better was to extend the fight scenes a little longer than they were. What they lacked in fights though they made in chase. Renner and Weisz must have practiced their sprinting techniques for this film since most of the action was involved in navigating streets at top speed. A few of these chases were exciting, most likely due to the use of vehicles and loud instrument music, yet some just felt a little over-dramatic or pointless. I guess when you up the skill level of the enemies, i.e. replacing an army of civilian cops with some elite members of the squad, you have to know your limits. Regardless fans are sure to enjoy Cross's moves and be satisfied with where the series is going. Bourne Legacy is a decent sequel that helps fill in some gaps while opening new uncertainties. The writing staff has some questions to answer in the next film, which there is sure to be, and also needs to do more with what they introduced in this film. Perhaps then my wishes for action scenes will come true, but until then this is satisfying enough. My scores for this film are the following: Action/Adventure/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5

As a fan of the Bourne franchise, I enjoyed this deeper look in to that universe. The movie really does feel like one giant glorified DVD extra for that trilogy and I mean that in a good way. Deeper layers are revealed and the intrigue is as good as what we've seen before even though the character motivation isn't as strong across the board. Renner is fabulous as the second generation super spy. My only real complaint about this installment (because it does feel like they are blatantly building for three more films) is that the resolution has no real teeth. Still, it's a very good effort from a very good cast with hints and touches to the Bourne films of the past.Overall, a thumbs up and a very enjoyable time at the cinema.

OK so I saw Bourne Legacy earlier today and I'll admit, I was disappointed. It's easily the worst of the series. It wasn't bad, there were actually some pretty tense parts in the movie, but there were some things that really bothered me as well.A plus about the movie is the action (even though there isn't much of it). I thought the lab shooting scene was very tense for a PG-13 film and got me interested in the movie again because before that, the movie was very slow. The chase at the end was pretty good as well. The acting is pretty good as well.Now something that really bother me was the plot. It felt like after a 2 hour movie, nothing was accomplished. The film feels unfinished because of this. As I said earlier, the film is very slow paced, especially the first hour. And with there only being three maybe four action scenes in the whole movie, you really got bored while waiting for the action to start up again. Gilroy doesn't develop any of the characters at all, even though the movie hints at Cross' origin, most likely setting up a plot point for the sequel.Even though it sounds like I hate the film, I actually enjoyed it, just nowhere near as much as I wanted too, making it a disappointment for me.6/10

I feel that it is my duty to take some time to write a review on this movie; I had to create an IMDb account just to write it. I'm not going to spend a long time writing a cute review because I've already spent $50 and 2 hours of my life in this endeavor. I saw each previous Bourne movie in theaters and own two of them; they were unbelievable with awesomely choreographed fight scenes, Jason Bourne ingenuity, and heart-racing and stopping action and suspense! HOWEVER, this Bourne Legacy movie somehow does have the same artistry of the others; there is significantly more dialog; many of the action scenes were so fast that I could not determine what had just happened; the pursuer team was so impotent that they were laughable; the musical score was sub-par in comparison; etc. There are only a hand full of movies that I've seen in my life that it has crossed my mind to leave while watching, and this was one of them. The best part of the movie was the first 30 minutes, and then the story just got lost. To add insult to injury, they play the hip and edgy Bourne them song when the credits rolled as in the other Bourne movies. Unfortunately, this just reminded me of how far the movie had missed the mark. Due to the unneeded complication of the story, I cannot even recommend this movie as one to rent when it arrives as a video rental; I wish that I could. I'm very disappointed.

On the contrary to most reviews available online now, my feeling is that the first half is actually more content-compacted than the second half. Literally, there's no subtitle on the screen for the last 20 min -- they don't need it cuz there's no talking, only fighting, motorbike chasing, parkouring, etc. So what's next after the pair get rid of a hunter and find some temporary peace? Oh yes, we are expecting sequel...I like the first half because it's full of drama, wisdom (on both the "good" and the "bad" sides), and emotions gradually grow, as well as audience' awareness of what is happening. Forget about Jason Bourne, there are much more going on there, compared to which, an amnesic agent who is fighting to regain his identity looks just trivial. Aaron Cross actually got "profit" from the Outcome program -- his less-than-average intelligence got improved. And he doesn't want to lose it, which makes him not look so "moral" -- he stays in the program just to stay away from a even worse life, while his recruiter, Byer, and even Dr. Shearing, believe(d) that they are serving their country, at least. I feel that Cross started some casually romantic feeling towards Doc during the repeated visits for examinations. I mean, you don't really count the times you meet a certain doctor in a few years, unless you have some special feeling for him/her. And that near "harassing" lines inside the examination room. While Doc started to look at No.5 in a different way when he was focusing on preparing a fake passport for her. Maybe that was the first time that she saw one of her "participants" really working in the field. There's the saying that "Man who is seriously working is the sexiest" (or some line like that), absolutely true.The script is really "wide-open", in the sense that now anyone can add in another new program at any time. So there can be endless hunting, endless new agents/opponents, therefore endless sequels, if fans buy it. James Bond must get envious, cuz he cannot even kill a bad guy too fast sometimes but has to keep that for a future sequel. My only concerns are, first, now they've used up the idea of high-speed chasing and chaotic parkour in a crowded city, what other fresh things they can come up with next time? And second, since Aaron Cross has got permanently "infected", he needs the pills NO MORE, so the story actually needs the Doc NO MORE? hmmm that's a dangerous sign for a hero's lady in such a franchise... P.S. An interesting finding: Outcome had 6 remaining agents when it started to be burned down to ground. We've known that 4 were killed (1 in Pakistan, 1 in Seoul which I believe is the one under-covered into N-Korea intelligence network, the lonely ranger who got "demoted" for falling love, and No.6 who is the black guy), No.5 a.k.a Aaron Cross managed to escape, so who and where is the last one? A thread for sequel? Hope they didn't miscount...

After "The Bourne Ultimatum" became the most successful and critically praised film of a trilogy considered the consummate modern spy series, it was only a matter of time before the saga continued. With that film's director, Paul Greengrass, interested in pursuing other projects, and star Matt Damon uninterested in returning without Greengrass, Universal has been forced to expand the "Bourne" universe, and the result is "The Bourne Legacy."For those up in arms over the continuing of the franchise without Damon front and center, fast-rising action star Jeremy Renner assumes the new face of of the series without skipping a beat as Aaron Cross, the product of another CIA program offshoot of Treadstone called Outcome. Backed by the talents of Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton — and co-written and directed by longtime series scribe Tony Gilroy — "The Bourne Legacy" keeps tonally with the original trilogy and generates the same degree of respect.In terms of the "Bourne" consistency, "Legacy" maintains the back-and-forth structure of the skilled spy on the loose vs. the CIA division trying to track him down. The film takes place at the same time as "Ultimatum." When Jason Bourne becomes a media story as seen in that film, the CIA senses a public relations nightmare is about to unfold, and Norton's Eric Byer — the man behind most of the agency's black ops programs — has to clean up the mess.Byer finds damning evidence connecting Blackbriar to Outcome, a program involving nine agents who have received physical and mental genetic enhancements and assist in top-secret military reconnaissance. Given the Bourne fiasco, he determines the best way to save the body is amputate the limb, and Cross and all "participants" in the Outcome program are targeted.Given the advanced science involved in Outcome, the CIA employed a top-flight science facility to regularly check in with those agents and test new genetic drugs. Weisz's Dr. Marta Shearing soon finds her life in jeopardy and her name in the headlines, and after Cross survives an attempt to wipe him off the map, he connects with her and the two go on the run.This story really opens the door up to the potential of the series going forward. At one point we learn just how many secret black ops programs the CIA has commissioned, which will surely capture the imagination of series fans who have steeped themselves in the world of "Bourne."As its own film, however, "Legacy" is missing some key pieces. Especially at the beginning, Gilroy focuses extensively on connecting the original trilogy to this new part of the "Bourne" universe. One of his and Universal's primary concerns appears to be providing just cause for continuing the franchise rather than delivering a complete spy action/thriller. Even the opening shot of "Legacy" directly mirrors the closing shot of "Ultimatum."Mostly, it's the conclusion that doesn't do the build-up justice. The script appropriately takes its time with the construction of Cross and Marta and clearly sets up their motivations, except that they are motivations out of necessity rather than desire, which ultimately takes a toll on the emotional payoff. "Legacy" just doesn't arrive anywhere, content instead to be the start of something new.Sticking to the series formula gives "Legacy" a certain level of comfort. There's no lack of "Bourne"-patented clever solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems, exotic locales or impressive enemy takedowns. If anything, it's a little too reliant on what worked in the past, unwilling to take big risks and consequently unable to strike any new notes.More exposition also means less time for action. The trailer spoils most of the best action moments in the film, and in general "Legacy" doesn't aspire to reach the bar set by previous entries. Gilroy proves an adequate director in this regard, possessing Greengrass' eye for frenetic action but without the same degree of editing prowess."The Bourne Legacy" amounts to a stepping stone to what can be for this franchise rather than exploding out of the gate as the start of something special. As has been the case with the filmmaking choices in key reboots this year, namely "The Amazing Spider-Man," there has been a willingness to make sacrifices in the first "new" entry so that future installments can run off the leash. In theory, Aaron Cross isn't tied to anything. He could even team up with Jason Bourne in the future and take it once more to Langley's doorstep.There's legitimate promise in the future of all things "Bourne," so at the worst, "Legacy" comes out as one of the lesser entries of an otherwise exceptional series. There are much, much uglier blemishes on the records of Hollywood's biggest and best franchises. If anything, "Legacy" should end up a tiny, even glamorous scar in the service of something great.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com

I just rewatched well most of the Bourne movies(it was like 2.5 because I didn't have the time lol) this week to prep for this reboot installment. And I was glad I did I forgot how great they were. They were a smart mans action movie and felt raw and realistic in part due to Matt Damon's intentionally stiff, sort of cold, bad ass performance. The only thing that didn't play well was how slightly redundant the movies became after a while the second installment was way overlong and since his love interest is killed off in the beginning it definitely takes something away from the proceedings they felt darker and not as fun as when Marie was around but by the end of the film he began to get in touch with himself which was nice to see in a subtle character building scene. Entering into the Bourne Legacy I think it's important to have an open mind. This is a completely different movie. It centers on Aaron Cross aka no. 5 he's a sort of super soldier engineered by the government but after the events of the first two movies and during the events of the third his story unravels as the government begins killing off it's "experiments". As you can guess he escapes and makes his way to the doctor he met with for his dwindling meds that keep him strong physically as well as mentally. Chaos of course ensues he meets up with the doctor aka his new love interest played well enough by Rachael Weisz and they do a little globe trotting as they are pursued. It all seems fairly generic but the movie has an almost amateur, visual pizazz to it. The film feels a little clumsy and it definitely works in it's favor in my opinion, the action feels more real and not as stagey and the last motorycyle setpiece chase scene takes the genre to new heights it's kinetically electrifying I was literally on the edge of my seat and even yelled out a few parts. It's a fun flick. As for Jeremy Renner well he's no Matt damon which is a good thing because they are two different characters and his take on Alex Cross is more emotionally engaging which makes for a nice change and his relationship with Weisz although a slight bit forced feels solid. The movie smartly starts off with a scene of him emerging form ice cold waters scantily clad echoing the scene that started the franchise. And when he emerges I had already fallen in love, he's so sexy in this film and I'm sure this will really start his career as a leading man/box office draw he's enaging, masculine but emotional and he nails the fight choreography aggressively. All in all it's not a perfect film there are some questionable moments but overall I don't think you can compare this film to the first three it's a different beast a little less smart maybe but one hell of a wild ride. I'm exciting to see where it goes.

There's nothing special about the film, just a replacement of characters from the original trilogy. In fact considering the length of the film you'd expect it to pack a story that is complete in itself, even if it was just a part of a possible series to follow, but it seemed rather incomplete to me.That apart Rachel Weisz does a good job in the film, but personally I like Damon as Bourne much more than Renner as Aaron Cross. Also, there are some minor differences in the story line so it is not altogether boring. That along with some nice action sequences makes the film watchable and a decent time-killer(if you can spare some) on the whole.

Seriously the story could have been a little more improvised and suited for the action ... the acting was good....action scenes was well taken ... but overall it lacked the Bourne touch... It lacked the Matt Damon magic and the older Bourne movies style and thrills ...the assassin which at all bourne movies used to hunt down bourne was more strong and a sure strong enemy but in this bourne movie that thai assassin sent by the CIA could not make a good run for the action created...it was just vague and bike chasing in the end instead of cars was a change but was kinda stretched and long, making it boring and tiresome .... Renner tried to give his best ...while Weisz and the rest of the cast did a nice job... maybe it could try make up for this movie in the next installment if there is gonna be one... its a watchable movie if u like action movies.

Some action...uses to many cuts from the Matt Damon franchise spliced into the story to make it seem contemporary to Jason Bourne's characterization. I was disappointed that this film has very little actionable fight scenes (a staple when considering it's dovetailing on Jason Bourne's character.). Ed Norton delivers a flat performance as an NSA agent who is "large and in charge" behind the scenes.The movie is too predictable. Very canned...gratuitous motorcycle chase scene with near misses. If this is one that is high on your list, I suggest you see it...when it comes out on RedBox.

Can a Sequel/Spin off stand up to the original series without it's protagonist ??This is the million dollar question I asked myself when I first heard about this movie being made. Watching the film it seems everyone involved with this project at Universal also had the same question in mind because although the movie is not half bad it is stuck between trying to be a departure from the original trilogy while also trying to retain the structural similarities with it.It took everyone by surprise when both Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass decided not to come back and do a fourth one which was being planned as the final chapter before the inevitable reboot. While Damon brought a very sympathetic and human side to this spy character, it was Paul Greengrass who infused Bourne 2 and Bourne 3 with a non stop sense of kinetic energy that worked very well for the franchise .Tony Gilroy, writer/director knows this universe very well having written all the previous films and it shows. There is a lot of filling the gaps in the plot in the first half of the movie where Gilroy resorts to lengthy dialog and slow paced editing to expand on the idea of why and how is CIA going to kill it's rogue agents referencing events from Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum to give us a sense that the narrative is set running parallel to those two movies. It comes of as a smart writing move to let us know more shady details and background about the whole CIA recruitment and training program and why do they want to run down their own super spy program.Edward Norton plays Eric Bryer, an ex military recruiter for the agency now brought back to "clean up the mess". It's a welcome departure for Norton who revels in playing grey characters and he does justice to what is given to him. Watching him perform I was asking myself why did they not cast him as the lead in this one, he does not look too old for the part and would have made a solid upgrade from Matt Damon.But keeping my nerdy wishes aside I realized how good Jeremy Renner was in this role as Aaron Cross, from the opening sequence in Alaska to the hyper kinetic climax in Manila he seemed right for the part and elevated a few sequences with his unpredictability. The memory loss of a super spy is done away with a sci-fi element that does seem a little too convenient at times. Helping him on his journey for survival is Rachel Weisz as Dr.Marta Shearing who is indirectly contributing to the cause of creating these super spies via administering what is referred to as "chems" (enhancing drugs) into their bodies. This is where the movie somewhat has it's biggest failure, there is absolutely no chemistry between Renner and Weisz even though the director included a few scenes to build on it.The movie boasts of more strengths than weaknesses in editing, cinematography and excellent background score by James Newton Howard. While it may not have many crowd pleasing moments which will leave many average action movie goers somewhat disappointed, I was more than happy to enjoy the more logically constructed plot . It is clear from the beginning that Gilroy is going for a more cerebral and toned down approach compared to the previous films. There is radical shift in the second half of the narrative and the movie never lets up after that. The last 20 to 30 minutes really crank it up on the action quotient that leave you wanting more.So here it is, while not as great as it's predecessors the movie is a solid entry into the franchise if you can sit through the talky and expository first half. Matt Damon is surely missed for his presence and charisma but Renner fits right into his role and ensures that the Bourne's legacy is not tarnished after all7 stars out of 10.

Alright, so I have actually been anticipating this movie for a while, but after reading some of the reviews, I cooled the thoughts of this being as good as the other Bournes. And I think that helped a lot. So The Bourne Legacy is about Aaron Cross (Renner), another Treadstone operative, trying to find answers after being ambushed. Meanwhile, CIA officials (Norton) is trying to "discontinue" all Treadstone operatives after the events of the Jason Bourne trilogy. This leads to Treadstone's scientist (Weisz) getting involved with the scandal. The face of the CIA in this movie is played by Edward Norton. And Norton has always been a great actor, but due to spotty dialogue, he wasn't used to his full potential. The same could be said for Weisz, although she managed to make more with the script. I know that most people have been sketchy about the whole idea of another Bourne movie without Bourne, but I can tell you that Aaron Cross has the same ability to kick ass. Jeremy Renner was fantastic as the follow up to Bourne. He had the brain and the brawn just like Damon. And Norton and Weisz' characters can relate to David Straithairn and Julia Stiles' characters from the original trilogy. This uses much of the same formula, but it ultimately leads to less originality. But one thing that slightly annoyed me by the end of this movie, was how they kept on trying to link this film with the previous trilogy. And I know that it is the same "universe" as the previous trilogy, but it didn't need to be called a Bourne movie. Now it's going to be compared to the trilogy and it will lose that argument. And Aaron Cross will be compared to Jason Bourne, and it will lose that argument as well.So there's my big complaint with this movie: its title. (As well as trying to connect Cross to Bourne) But there are a lot of things to like about this movie. For instance, I like how it took its time in the beginning setting up the story, rather than jumping into unnecessary action sequences. Also, the relationship between Cross and the Scientist works really well. Its believable and interesting to see how the questions meet the answers. In conclusion, I believe that trying to make this a direct sequel to the Jason Bourne trilogy was a backfire and that they tried to make it too much like the trilogy. It would have worked best for them to take Aaron Cross' story and make it uniquely his without trying to tie him to Bourne. I would be in if there is a sequel, but I would love it if Damon came back to the game. {B}

The Bourne Legacy is one of those movies that you've already seen after reading the plot synopsis. It is about a man who is on the run from a secretive government agency that is trying to kill him. That's it. There is really nothing else that needs to be said. It looks and sounds important. It opens with a lot of important-looking government people who have a lot of of top notch computer equipment talking insider jargon about something that sounds really important. It takes us a minute or two of confusion before we realize that it doesn't really matter what they are talking about. All that yakking is just exposition to set up a long chase. Why didn't they just skip the chatter and get to the chase? The movie opens with an intriguing series of events. A man (Jeremy Renner) is floating in icy cold water and reaches out to grab a cylinder. He pulls himself out of the water and we realize that he's half-naked, exposed to the elements in the snowiest mountains of Alaska. He sits by the fire to warm himself. His cylinder contains green and blue pills. For the next hour, or so, he will spend his time in that frozen wilderness wrestling with wolves, climbing mountains and taking his medication.That's followed by some events that are not so intriguing. We sit through a lot of boring (and rather confusing) talk from those important government people (who are played by Edward Norton, Stacy Keach and Scott Glenn) who are very upset that their secret agent program - called "The Program" - is no longer so secret. It seems that "The Program" has suffered a security breach, so the important people order all of their field agents to take a triangular yellow pill that will take them off "The Program" – the hard way.Yet, as you might expect, one stubborn agent refuses to take the pill. That's our friend in Alaska, who is briefed by the agency with a missile that destroys the cabin he just exited. With some quick thinking he takes out the drone that was carrying that missile and goes on the run. That's the set-up for the rest of the movie. This man, whom we eventually learn is named Aaron Cross, has been given medication that will enhance his survival abilities, thus making him an important asset to "The Program." Aaron needs the medication; unfortunately it was destroyed along with the cabin, so his only hope is to find the doctor who prescribed it to him. She's Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), a biologist who was in charge of dispensing medication to the agents in the field. In a very scary scene, a fellow doctor (Zeljko Ivanek) goes insane and shoots everyone else in her lab, so she goes on the run herself, eventually joined up with Aaron as they trot across the globe.From there it is one long chase as operatives from "The Program" try to kill Aaron and Marta as they attempt to get to The Philippines to get their hands on some of Aaron's medication. That means a lot of disguises, phony passports and surveillance cameras watching their every move. It also means that we get several spectacular stunt pieces and shoot-outs. There is a car chase, a foot chase, and a very long motorcycle chase around the streets of Manila while our heroes are chased by a dogged assassin whose role in this story is left kind of a mystery.The Bourne Legacy is, of course, the fourth film of the Jason Bourne series that started 10 years ago with "The Bourne Identity." Up till now it has starred Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, but he grew tired of the series and bowed out. Now, we have Jeremy Renner (in truth, a scruffier and much more focused actor) in the lead. He gives the film a certain amount of credibility, but what does he have to work with? Unlike the latest James Bond pictures which contain a lot of action but also gravity and weight and a tight storyline, this series is kind of threadbare. What it needs is a script with some purpose, some focus, and a better narrative. This particular entry is all over the place. The film is sure-footed as far as its action scenes go, but to what end? This is a competent, good-looking action picture that is all style and very little substance. As action movies go, you could do worse (see this instead of "Total Recall".) but you won't take much away from it when it's over.**1/2 (of four)

Of all the Bourne films (identity, supremacy, ultimatum and legacy) I have to say that I liked this one the least. I like this one the least because there was no Bourne in it. I do think that writer Tony Gilroy did an excellent job in introducing this character and making the audience realize that his circumstances are the results of the first three Bourne films. The story line is basically the same as the other films.. Bourne must die and we must hunt him down (in this case Aaron Cross). When the last film ended you knew that Treadstone was on its way out and there were drastic measures that were sure to follow. Well, this film is the result of those drastic measures. You know from the trailer that Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) has been genetically enhanced, but they do not tell you much else (which is good). He somehow hooks up with Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) and you start to get that "I need to find a cure" kind of feeling. To top it all off there is the introduction of a super human, Larx #3 (Louis Ozawa Changchien) who is an emotionless, focused, killing machine. I guess these kinds of "terminator" characters have become very popular because I saw his would-be female equal just last week in Total Recall. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) was responsible for cleaning up the whole mess and covering up all the evidence of the past. Wow, he should run for office (smile). The entire cast did a good job in delivering the intent of this film including the left over cast members from the previous films (Joan Allen, David Staithaim, etc.). I think they should make one more Bourne film where Aaron Cross runs into Jason Bourne. They should call it The Bourne Reckoning. I don't think that the Bourne series should end without Bourne in it. I know it is not just me. I liked this film well enough, although it was a bit long (over 2 hours). I have always been a longtime fan of the Bourne series so I was not about to stop now. This is a film that would be worth the price of a ticket, if for no other reason than to encourage Matt Damon to come back and finish out this series the right way. I am giving this film a green light.

This is truly a case of great actors who are left out there in the cold by a director, who essentially does not even try to respect them and the audience's intelligence by giving them something original or interesting. Tony Gilroy had written not only the first three Bourne films but the great Michael Clayton as well but here, it is obvious that he is on a destructive ego trip. Gilroy is more interested in making people see on how smart he is as a scriptwriter and filmmaker than actually try to entertain and stay true to what made the other Bourne films special. With that destructive mind set, Gilroy forgets that you need faith in your actors and the material they are working with in order to drive the movie forward. Gilroy also commits the biggest sin of all, which is to never underestimate the intelligence of your audience.The script by Gilroy and his brother Dan tries to be cutting edge in scientific jargon and smart dialog but ends up with so many inconsistencies and flimsy characterization that you have to double back twice to see if Gilroy actually had a hand in the original "Bourne Trilogy". The characters in this film are only there to get from A to B and none of them with the exception of Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner (Who you can clearly see are both working beyond the call of duty to make something out of their paper-thin roles) has any real purpose at all. Poor Edward Norton is only there to bark orders and you can clearly see how frustrated he is with his role in certain scenes. The direction is not even very good, with pacing problems and a running time that excessively too long for its own good. The action scenes (The few of them in the film) do not jar well and are boring to say the least.My advice to Universal, if there has to be a sequel, bring back Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner (Who both deserve medals for their efforts in making this lazy, self indulgent script work) and get rid of Tony Gilroy, who clearly does not respect anybody other than himself. You might have a better movie if you do.

There should have only been one.By the time the overlong 135 minute The Bourne Legacy realizes that it's an unwelcomed addition to the best trilogy in the history of cinema, it completes its minuscule 20 minutes of uninspired action roughly 2 minutes before the credits roll. If, in lieu of action, they wanted this as a "thinking person's" thriller, they also failed on that, as this was one of the most basic films, spy or not, I've seen in quite awhile.Sowhat are we left with? Great performances? No. Plot twists? Nada. Surprises? Nope. Decent cinematography? Okay, it gets that for its hour-long stroll through the snowy Alaskan territory. In addition, I will say, after several mediocre Edward Norton performances, he stepped it up this time.Sadly, I cannot say the same for one of my favorite actors and the person that was supposed to carry this feature: Jeremy Renner. I've been a fan of his for a decade now and he always seems to be getting better and improving himself and the roles he takes on. Well, no one's perfect and he took a giant leap back here. Mercifully, as the movie closed – and the end was welcomed, by the way, he did step up his game, but only so slightly. Overall, Renner's Aaron Cross wasn't just the faux pas Bourne-spy; his role was literally an idiot that appeared more lucky at times than actually trained.The 3-minute-plot boils down to the final days of the true Bourne legacy when the big bad government is permanently shutting down all the programs surrounding the super-spies. On the target screen is semi-spy Cross and he nearly escapes assassination only to be worried about his drug addiction. (Don't ask; I've already gone too far...) He does team up with another nearly assassinated doctor of the program and together they're somewhat tracked with ten times less the suspense and awesomeness found in the original Bourne trilogy.It thoroughly goes without typing that this chapter was as needed as Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was. But, that's the bottom line fact. While not the worst movie I've seen, it is 100% unnecessary and felt like one very, VERY long deleted scene from the original films. Hell, even the action and fighting were so amateurish that it's an insult to stamp Bourne's name on this and not just name it Cross.They should have; you will feel cross when you leave the cinema.

When I first heard about The Bourne Legacy, my first thought was, "Here we go again." It definitely wasn't at the top of my must see list. My main reason was that the first three films worked so well with Matt Damon that I couldn't picture the next film going on without him. But luckily, The Bourne Legacy holds up just fine. Fasten your seat belts, you're in for a good time.We who have seen the trilogy know that what happened with Jason Bourne didn't go according to plan. But as it turns out, Jason Bourne wasn't the only one involved. In fact, there are quite a few people involved, and after the Bourne fiasco gets out of hand, the organization behind it decide to take care of all loose ends, eliminating everyone involved. Except for two.One is named Aaron Cross(played by Jeremy Renner), and the other is a nice doctor(played by the lovely Rachael Weisz) who was simply doing what she is told. The two of them know each other from the past. After they are both nearly killed, they decide to team up and outrun the people desperately trying to shut them up.Considering I have seen the trilogy only one time, i was afraid of going into The Bourne Legacy, mainly because I thought I would be lost. About twenty minutes into the movie, I was thinking, once again, "Here we go." But luckily it finally came through. I had a good time here because, thank the lord, I knew what was going on. The people I was with all fell asleep because they were lost, but I hung in there, and it was a good ride.There are some terrific action sequences, it's very entertaining, and Renner and Weisz make a good team, especially because they are so talented.Michael Clayton director Tony Gilroy, who penned the scripts for the first three films, does a nice job here. But there were some flaws. It sort of drags on, you really have to at least know something about Jason Bourne before you see it, otherwise you won't know what in the heck is going on,you get a sense of de ja vu, and lastly, Edward Norton.Norton is such a great actor, but he really doesn't get to do a whole lot here, and if you're going to have someone as talented as Norton in a movie, you need to give him something to do. Overall, it's a pretty good movie. Don't listen to the critics, it's worth your time. Watch the first three before you go into it. You won't regret it.B+

I write with absolutely no joy to speak of when I post my first review for this site. Title: The Bourne Legacy. Result: heartbreak. And not in the good way. It would be easy to say that action movies aren't really my cup of tea but, seeing as I am an avid fan of the previous Bourne movies, I came into the theatre with anticipation as I realized that Jeremy Renner was, as it turned out, not playing Jason but rather a new character, Aaron Cross. I was intrigued and, foolishly it seemed, hooked. The first thing you need to know about this film is that there is no story of speak of: any hint of a plot had been sufficiently deleted once this script hit the editing room, it appears. What the trailer makes this movie out to be is nothing at all what it managed to deliver: boring, confusing, and stupid doesn't even begin to cover it. I hope my words (though I doubt the director will be reading this) cut the man who thought he could film a chase scene to the bone. Not only does this director (and, I suppose, the writers are to blame as well)accomplish the most dragged out scenes in Hollywood history but also he has gone on the cheap: yes, ladies and gentleman, it seems that other Bourne-related locations (Paris, Berlin, Tangiers, Zurich) have been sacrificed for the wilds of Alaska (oh, wow, groundbreaking) and Manila, the Phillipienes (I mean no disrespect to the natives of the Phillipienes but you do NOT have a Bourne movie in a place nobody has heard of). The movie is about two hours too long and, with the exception of Renner, Norton, and Weisz, I didn't care if their characters lived or died. A sliver of light to this other wise dark review is that Renner's performance pleased me greatly: not only does he have an uncanny resemblance to Matt Damon's Bourne but he projects a personality that makes somewhat sense with his character's trials: instead of Matt Damon's introverted, almost-mute, and angry Jason Bourne, Renner's Aaron Cross was funny, charming,socially easy going and emulated the same physical grace as Jason Bourne. It was only a shame that Renner's talent as an actor is otherwise shadowed by this disgracefully written and cheap attempt at continuing the Bourne trilogy. All I can say is this: Next time, the followup to the Bourne-universe had better knock peoples' socks off because, the way I'm seeing it, this film murdered one of my favourite franchises. And even Jeremy Renner is not enough to make me forgive so easily.

The first Bourne movie was really the high point for this now foursome. Matt Damon was quiet and controlled in his portrayal of a man who had loss his identity. Like a lot of the fans of the books I was disappointed that the second movie didn't use the book's story and the third movie except for Matt Damon and Joan Allen was forgettable. So now comes this reboot and frankly I was hoping for more but not expecting it. Jason Renner is okay in his role but his role is part of the problem. Jason Bourne you cared about, Jason Bourne you could identify with and that's probably due to Matt Damon's performance but also it was due to the fact that they made Jason Bourne a real flesh and blood man. The same cannot be said for this new "Outcome agent". They hint at his back story but their so concerned with leaving themselves something to talk about in the next film that the audience frankly doesn't get this new character. Yes he fights great, runs and jumps but you've seen it all before. Inbetween those moments there is a lot of nothing from him. In fact his chatty nature really works against the whole character persona of these guys who exist but don't exist. The behind the scenes in Washington with, the brilliant Edward Norton and Stacey Keach (who I was glad to see) is far more intriguing but they the story doesn't allow for what could have been some really great stuff. Poor Rachel Weitz who I also think is a great actress is totally wasted until the end of the movie I really wanted her to die. Well I'd say that this is the end of Bourne but I know that's not true.

Before going to see the latest installment in the Bourne series, make sure to whip out your checklist of things to expect: a government conspiracy involving supersoldiers, an innocent female that is dragged along for an unromantic adventure which she has very little purpose in, a running-on-the-rooftops escape scene, a high-speed car chase that goes on for ten minutes too long, and a supersoldier whose objective is to take out another supersoldier.Yes, this checklist could apply to any of the three Bourne movies starring Matt Damon. After Legacy, it's clear that these trademarks are customary of any film in the series. The action sequences were impressive at times, drawn out for too long other times, but all in all, you're bound to get what you're expecting. Jeremy Renner, fresh off of his blockbuster role in Avengers, picks up the reins right where Damon left off, and a brand new cast follows, including Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton.We're immediately reintroduced into the world of genetically-enhanced spies with a training facility in Alaska, which Aaron Cross (Renner) progresses through with flying colors, until the program's termination comes into effect and he finds himself on the run from a government agency that wants him dead.Sound familiar? Of course it does. This is no different than any other Bourne movie. Renner's performance as Cross wasn't on par with Damon's performances, but other than that, the acting was very similar, the action and pace were very similar, and the entire movie had a 'been there, done that' feel to it.Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily, because each of the three previous Bourne movies had a lot of these things in common as well. But sooner or later, this trend gets old. You can only rehash a plot so many times before it wears thin, and this is a prime example of why some series should end on a good note.This is about as average as a movie can get - I had my checklist ready, and I knew what to expect coming in. I was completely satisfied, I got what I wanted out of the movie, and that's as far as it goes. No surprises, nothing but straight, in-your-face action for 135 minutes. Don't expect anything more or anything less than a middle-of-the-run action flick.

i am a huge fan of Jeremy Renner and i was waiting for this movie for months because i am also a big fan of the Bourne trilogy. This movie was very interesting in the way that it fit into Ultimatum very well but the beginning really had me sleeping. It is important to listen and watch all parts of a movie but this one keep stretching it to a point where it wasn't necessarily. There was too much talking and less action, but when there was action it was kick ass insane. still wish there was more hand to hand combat fighting but this was still great. The ending was good in which it tried to be like Ultimatum. the leading roles were portrayed great and at the end of the day the Bourne Legacy was decent, expected more, but had a good time. definitely go check it out if you are into the Bourne movies/books, Jeremy Renner, and/or Treadstone.

So I've taken enough theater classes to know that a movie should have a, Plot, Climax, and a ENDING.This movie has NONE of those. I'm a huge Bourne fan and was anxious to see the Jeremy Renner try to take on the new role of the hero in this movie. The acting in this movie was good, but the writers stunk! There was NO PLOT, no CLIMAX, and NO ENDING. It was a huge disappointment to me and I would not recommend wasting your time or money on it. Although if you like movies that are two hours long with NOTHING going on in them, then this might be the one for you. Another thing that upset me was that Aron Cross seemed to have a small goal or no goal at all in the ENTIRE movie! I'm not sure who directed this movie but they did an EXTREMELY poor job.

this film was great it put together the thinking and action of the first 3 with a little humor from the new agent Aaron Cross. i find that if you look at the film by itself you will be confused and out of touch. but if you actually enjoyed the other 3 and want to see how the situation bourne started escalates then watch this film. it does what 3 did for 2. takes important scenes and makes them make a lot more sense. i would like to state its no academy award winning film i gave it a 9 because as a series as a whole this makes the movie a higher number. by itself its probably a 7.5 to a 8. i loved this film i think people are way to over the top about ratings and if you like action then go see this if you like the other bournes watch it if you are just interested in the movie and have not watched the others watch the others then this you will enjoy in a lot more this way. anyways if you are reading this thanks hope it helped somewhat enjoy the movie and member if you go into it thinking it is crap you might not like it just cause of your attitude just the same if you over hype it it might not meet up to expectations just go to enjoy yourself and you will.

Great cast. Great acting. However, The entire film feels like the beginning to a movie. You keep telling yourself, 'wow, the intro was long now the movies really starting..oh nevermind'. ::Spoilers:: The entire goal of the protagonist is to acquire more of his regimented medicine. The goal of his enemies is to kill him. There is no trying to get back at the CIA, no typical Bourne stuff. The Bourne series was unnecessarily reused and they really should have just started off fresher. Scenes were drawn out, there were only about 2 clever plays made, and the main enemy never meets the prot. It's all very separated and remote. No connections are formed and we are not given the hope that he seeks to solve the issues at hand. They also completely write off Bourne.. wouldn't he know Pamela gets framed and that the overhead is still controlling black ops groups? A lot of things were not well thought out for this movie and it was entertaining but disappointing.

Instead of this weird and at times incomprehensible jumble of a movie! This is another thoroughly unnecessary, sequel, prequel, re-booth or whatever this film was supposed to be.It is entirely too long, and I'm usually the last to complain about a movie's length when its quality equals its running time, but not in this case. They could have easily cut 15-20 minutes from the movie and none would have been the wiser.The Bourne trilogy was very good as it was and did NOT need another movie added to it. Matt Damon re-invigorated his career playing Jason Bourne, while Doug Lyman and Paul Greengrass with Tony Gilroy as their go to screenwriter, showed what talent and creativity can produce by literally turning the spy thriller genre on its head! Proof is in the pudding as they say and the two subsequent James Bond movies reflected that new reality. Craig's 007, is, like Damon's Bourne, a much more somber, violent and unpredictable man, with a penchant for close-quarters-combat and revenge."The Bourne Legacy" was an unfocused, at times meandering and messy film. Which is kind of surprising, given that Tony Gilroy's directorial debut was the superb "Michael Clayton", I don't know, but I expected more..I mean what was the deal with that whole episode with the wolf, I mean I know and understood what happened in it and its purpose. Still, I gotta ask, really?! The cast was alright and while I like Jeremy Renner as an actor, "The Hurt Locker, "The Town" and now "The Avengers", he really did not shine like his usual self in this movie. It looked like he tried to step into Damon's shoes and continue his ( no pun intended) legacy, however that did not work at all...Rachek Weisz was OK but the rest of the cast was just there...I hope that they really stop making anymore Bourne movies, with no Bourne in them.However, given Hollywood's on-going identity crisis and lack of originality and creativity, I doubt that we've seen the last of "Bourne's universe", which in this movie fan's humble opinion would be a mistake!

The Bourne trilogy, loosely (VERY loosely!) based on the international bestsellers by Robert Ludlum and starring Matt Damon as the amnesiac black ops agent on the run from his former masters, redefined the espionage-thriller genre for the 21st century; with its gritty, realistic action; serious themes and emphasis on character and plot over glamour and exoticism. No less a franchise as James Bond has since been stylistically influenced by this groundbreaking series. But unlike the flamboyant 007, Jason Bourne's story was one with a clear beginning, middle and end. That end masterfully came about in the closing scenes of 'The Bourne Ultimatum'. For years it was believed Universal had finally laid one of its most successful franchises to rest - but inevitably, mass popularity and the lure of unprecedented commercial success won out, and 'The Bourne Legacy' is the result...The Bourne franchise is back, but oddly enough, Jason Bourne isn't. When Matt Damon, perhaps rightly, declined to return his iconic character to the big screen, Universal cast Jeremy Renner to play an entirely different character, albeit one patterned after Bourne at least on the surface level. Tony Gilroy, screen-writer of all Bourne films too date and the director of this one, has described 'Legacy' as not so much a sequel as much as an 'expansion' of the universe, and having seen the film, I have decided it is prudent to take him at his word.The early part of 'The Bourne Legacy' runs parallel to the events of 'The Bourne Ultimatum'. Even as Jason Bourne races across the globe, exposing the Treadstone program he was once part of, Colonel Eric Byer (played by Edward Norton), becomes increasingly concerned about the fall-out Bourne's very public actions will have on the myriad of US Government sanctioned black ops program. When the sh#t finally hits the fan (in the aforementioned ending of 'Ultimatum'), Byer decides to liquidate the 'Outcome' program, closely related to the now-exposed Treadstone. This involves not only the termination of its deep-cover genetically enhanced operatives, but also the scientists behind the breakthroughs that made the program possible.The movie follows the stories of the two survivors of the purge-Outcome field operative Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) and Outcome scientist and medical researcher Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who must depend on each other for their very survival. The pulse-pounding and often brutal action scenes are complemented very nicely by the chemistry between Renner and Weisz's characters. Marta is definitely a much superior female character to Franke Potente's Marie and Julia Stiles' Nicky Parsons from the trilogy. And Norton's morally ambiguous Byer comes across not so much as a villain as much as the uber-pragmatist, a self- confessed 'Sin Eater' who buries the 'moral excrement' in his work deep down inside. But where the film derives its strength from characterization and action, it is severely flawed when it comes to plot...especially towards the end. The conclusion is abrupt and provides hardly any resolution, beyond the tacit assurance of yet another sequel set in the Bourne universe...For a series that prided itself on its masterful story-telling, 'Legacy's' open-ended conclusion is sure to leave a sour taste in the mouths of many a die-hard fan and critic alike!In conclusion, 'The Bourne Legacy' set out with a specific purpose-to make the Bourne franchise viable again by expanding the universe through new characters and concepts. It certainly achieves THAT purpose and more, but fails to retain the standards of its predecessors when viewed as a stand-alone story.

With very little connection to the first three movies, the storytelling in "The Bourne Legacy" is hollow, the action is sparse, and does not truly follow the legacy left by its predecessor.I believe Jeremy Renner is fully capable of taking over the franchise so closely associated with Matt Damon. The fans of the Bourne trilogy that followed the adventures of Jason Bourne still can't get over the fact that their hero is gone and has been replaced by Renner, a very suitable leading man, physically and emotionally. Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton added gleaming support to the rather lackluster structure of the film, screenplay-wise.Robert Elswit's arresting cinematography and John Gilroy's smart editing makes the film look first-rate. The chase scene in Manila is reminiscent to the iconic Moscow car chase scene in "The Bourne Supremacy." Though the motorcycle chase sequence shot in our busy streets will never be able to equal the adrenaline rush elicited by the first three films, it's fair to say that it comes close. The rest of the action scenes were solid and not overdone.The script was infused with jargon and sufficient action to divert the viewers from the movie's lack of soul. Even the great performances by Renner, Weisz, and Norton couldn't save the movie's thin plot and bleak conclusion. The ending was unappealing and abrupt it left most viewers at a loss. You can easily paint the disappointment etched in their faces as they hesitantly stood up from their seats and slowly left the theater.There are many questions left unanswered, such as why Outcome chose the Philippines as its laboratory for the sought-after pills. If the writers' intention is to leave room for future vicissitudes in the franchise's continuity, then it makes for a lame excuse. The idea alone of making a Bourne movie without Jason Bourne is ludicrous. In this respect, the fimmakers have succeeded in making the Bourne fans feel cheated and the new audience underwhelmed for trying to force a puzzle piece that just doesn't fit.For something so highly anticipated and over-hyped, "The Bourne Legacy" is a huge letdown. I gave this movie a 7/10 just because 25% of it was shot in Manila (a preposterous judgment for an equally absurd film).

Worth a watch but not as gripping as the previous Bourne series.Renner & Weisz have given their best to do justice for their characters. Edward norton has displayed a vibrant gesture as he always does.Action sequences may not be the best but are decent.Cross may not be liked all that much by Bourne fans.The tempo is comparitively slow to the other parts.The sequel gives scope for Gilroy to prove his worth. The sequel should be crafted carefully that it does not disturb the reputation of Bourne series.Gilroy's bold attempt requires more ingredients such as music,tempo and complicated strategies to become a winner.Hoping to watch a grand finale to the Bourne series like a delicious desert ending up a scrumptious meal.

"The Bourne Legacy" is a competent and satisfying spy action thriller, although I suspect it will be problematic for those unfamiliar with the first three "Bourne" films. This fourth chapter isn't quite the start of a new trilogy, as some of the ads have suggested; the events of the previous installment, "The Bourne Ultimatum," are heavily referenced, as are bits and pieces running through all the films, most notably the Treadstone and Blackbriar programs. It's never fair, having to catch up on ancient history before delving into a new installment, which should always be allowed to stand on its own. Still, if you can get past the intricate details, you may find that the film is engaging. It benefits strongly from the presence of Jeremy Renner, who takes the reins from Matt Damon as the next superspy-gone-rogue, whose name is Aaron Cross. With a fresh character at the helm, the series doesn't seem so repetitive.Although there is unfinished business with the original trilogy, which were based on novels by the late Robert Ludlum, this film behaves as if the story were staring all over again. This means that it's less about the plot and more about the craft of a spy thriller; scenarios are manufactured primarily so that Cross can employ his superior skills, not the least of which is his ability to engage in hand-to-hand combat. As the film progresses, the action will only get more elaborate and occur more frequently. It all culminates with a rather spectacular motorcycle chase on the surface streets and highways of Manila, at which point Cross is being pursued relentlessly by both an assassin and the entire police force. Does any of this mean anything? I'm hard pressed to say. But I sure enjoyed watching it. And the fact that the final shot is a boat riding off into the sunset suggests the filmmakers knew to not take the film so seriously.The film opens with Cross, a specially trained agent for a CIA offshoot called Outcome, roughing it in the snowy wilderness of Alaska. At precise intervals, he takes a dwindling supply of blue and green pills, which are later revealed to enhance mental and physical abilities. His unexpected encounter with another Outcome agent (Oscar Isaac) is cut short when a guided missile destroys the latter's cabin. He goes into pure survival mode; as he's being shot at by unmanned fighter planes, he removes a tracking device from under the skin of his stomach and forces a wolf to swallow it. It seems Cross is being hunted, although he doesn't know why. Fortunately, we in the audience do. Here enters Eric Byer (Edward Norton), a CIA official who has made it his mission to have the remaining Outcome agents assassinated. This comes on the heels of Jason Bourne's personal quest for the truth, which in turn led to the Treadstone and Blackbriar programs being publicly exposed.Meanwhile, we meet Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), a genetic scientist for Outcome. A series of unforeseen events, kick-started by her trusted colleague's inexplicable shooting spree, bring Shearing into Cross' life, the latter saving her life from CIA agents sent to assassinate her. We, of course, are not supposed to question the ease and speed with which Cross is able to make his way from Alaska all the way to Virginia – or perhaps it was Maryland, although I don't think it matters in the slightest. That's just how it happens in stories like this. Anyway, after fleeing the scene of a burning house, Shearing tells Cross that it's possible to make the side effects of his medications permanent. He only needs to be injected with a very specific type of virus. Trouble is, this can only be done at a pill factory in Manila. And so they board a plane for the Philippines, unaware that the CIA is tracking them down.The Rachel Weisz character is developed on a somewhat more advanced level than the Franka Potente character from the first two "Bourne" films. Shearing's profession, for one thing, has some bearing on the plot, which is to say that her actions can actually advance it. And because she understands the science behind the medications Cross has been taken, she does double duty as a provider of exposition. Having said that, her inclusion is still largely out of obligation for a female sidekick. This becomes especially apparent during the final act, at which point the pace dramatically picks up and we're inundated with stunts and special effects. It's strongly hinted that she will become his love interest, which should come as a surprise to no one. I have a feeling their relationship will be much less open to interpretation once the next film is released.I sound like I'm complaining, but really, this movie gave me everything I expected and actually wanted. It's not a great film by any means, and it certainly doesn't try for anything original as far as spy thrillers are concerned, but it sticks to its established formula well, and the cast was engaging. I don't think we're meant to delve too deeply into stories like this; they exist primarily as escapist entertainment, giving us plenty in the way of structure and spectacle but not so much in the way of meaning. I knew "The Bourne Legacy" was intended to be mindless fun when I saw a shot of Jeremy Renner scaling the walls of a house with the impossible speed and fluidity of Spider-Man. I watch these films convinced that there's no more mileage for a sequel to cover, and every time I'm proved wrong. This either means these films are genuinely good or I've become lazy. I prefer the former explanation.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)

Greetings again from the darkness. The Bourne series has often been viewed as the American version of James Bond ... more serious and with more action. Doug Liman directed the first, which was taken directly from the Robert Ludlum novel. Paul Greengrass then assumed control over the next two and added hyper-kinetic speed to the action sequences and focused on the conspiracy theories, with a fascinating hero looking to take down a corrupt system. Involved in all three as a writer, Tony Gilroy takes over as director in this fourth entry. Unfortunately, the Bourne series is not similar to Bond, in that the directors and lead actors are not so easily replaced.With Matt Damon (Jason Bourne) present only on computer screens, Jeremy Renner takes over the lead as the next super-spy-weapon. When Pam Landy (Joan Allen) blows the lid off Treadstone in a Congressional hearing, the shady back office meetings lead to the decision to shut down the program. We all understand what that means ... destroy the assets and lose the records. This decision is made by Edward Norton and Stacy Keach, both new to the series.The decision leads to a vicious scene featuring the always dependable character actor Zeljko Ivanek who almost completes his assignment, but misses out on Rachel Weisz (playing Dr Marta Shearing). Dr. Shearing is involved in the manufacturing of the "meds" that keep our super-spies and super strength and super intellect. Yes folks, our superheroes are roided-up! You have to hand it to Dr. Shearing - for a lab rat, she has a remarkable ability to stay alive despite being the target of many highly trained assassins. Of course, she does have a bit of help from Aaron Cross (Renner).Here is the real issue with the film. Instead of Bourne trying to bring down the corrupt system, this is really two hours of survival mode for Aaron Cross. It reminded me of the Monty Python bit as they face opposition on their castle storm "Run Away!, Run Away!". Most of the first half of the film is spent with him in search of meds, like any common drug addict, and the second half is spent on a motorcycle chase that goes on forever.As an action film, this one works just fine. The limited fighting and expanded chase scenes are well filmed and intense, it's just that as a viewer, it really isn't as much fun to cheer for someone who is running away as it is for someone (Bourne) looking to bring down a corrupt system. In addition to those I've mentioned, we get brief appearances from series' regulars Albert Finney, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Joan Allen, and Paddy Considine.The hope is that this is just a placeholder in the series. It's been five years since The Bourne Ultimatum, and hopefully, if the series continues, we will get Paul Greengrass back in the director's seat and Matt Damon teaming up with Jeremy Renner to wreak havoc on the true enemies of the state. Otherwise, the American Bond ends up as nothing more than an action film with no real purpose.

Caught d movie on its worldwide release. The Bourne Legacy actually suffers from the Legacy of Jason Bourne as on a standalone basis the film is actually above average. However being a sequel which actually runs parallel to the 3rd film (a first of sorts for sequels i reckon) the film fails on tempo and action is jaded and somewhat falls flat in comparison to the tempo set by Matt Damon s and Paul's grasses Bourne franchise Films, which are also known for being aggressive in execution. Especially the style of camera work (first person view) in Jason Bourne films really adds to the tension but here i actually fell asleep during some parts as they just talked and talked and then talked some more! Since originality in screenplay is dead the studios now rely on just milking successes full franchises (splitting 1 part into 2's like harry potter n upcoming turkey twilight for egg) rather than taking risk with something new or fresh. At the end your are left pondering, Why is this film there? the Bourne series finished as 1 of the best action spy trilogy and this film feels like those attempts such as Terminator 4 and terminator 5 which despite having Christian Bale dint wet any 1es appetite! Sadly The Bourne name may get this 4th installment (without Bourne actually being there!!) the required box office numbers and we may yet see another sequel, which will again be a waste of time,space,money,acting talents etc. The thing with good things is you should know when its done with rather than confirm that its over, sometimes going out on a high is the right thing, which this film surely isn't. If u do see it then erase the previous Bourne films from Ru memory and treat this on its own merit and u may well enjoy it as something above average but the moment u start comparing this 1 with previous Matt Damon's installment this 1 turns out to be a cold turkey!

I'd give this *** 1/4 Out of *****Now I love the original Bourne trilogy that centers around Jason Bourne and when I heard that this wasn't going to have Matt Damon in the role I thought it wasn't going to be good but however after seeing that Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye in The Avengers) will be in the lead role and that brighten my mood but I still thought he couldn't save the movie & I ended up eating my words along with my popcorn. But I should point out that if your a fan of the Jason Bourne character I hope you'll be happy with just hearing his name & seeing a couple of his pictures because he's not in this movie. I also should point out that this movies story is a lot more complicated to understand than that of Jason Bourne because like I said he's not in this movie and it focuses on Aaron Cross or Agent Outcome #5. Now the plot in a nutshell about this movie is Outcome #5 is like Jason Bourne he was a test experiment and with that being said he has the same inhuman qualities and advanced fighting skills as Jason Bourne and he shows that a few times (and it doesn't disappoint) but he need green pills to keep himself stabilized so he saves Marta Shearing (Rachel wieitz) an Outcome scientist who was meant to be killed by the CIA who has killed every Outcome Agent & Scientist (except Aaron Cross, herself, & Jason Bourne) so he convinces her he's on her side and he'll protect her of she helps him. So they go to Manilla where we learn his real name is Kenneth James Keitsom a private who was seemingly killed in the Iraq war. So she injects when the drugs he needs and is cured but keeps his enhanced physical abilities and they're pursued by LARX-03 an assassin then in Matrix: Reloaded like chase scene that was very entertaining and kept my attention they get away from him, seemingly knocked him out, and escape via a boat to parts unknown ending the movie. Now like I said this story is very hard to understand and it wasn't until about an hour and a half until I understood everything (that I will say was boring and almost had me asleep) they jumped 5 gears and satisfied me. The ending does make you angry because your expecting more but if we get a sequel we'll see it. Is this movie of the year? No but it's FAR from being the worst.

Sometimes it is a good thing to step back and chill a minute. Even knowing the propensity for this director to use rapid-cutting techniques didn't prepare me for the confusion and, well let's admit it, big fat headache it gave me while at the same time trying to focus on the quivering hand-held camera. Yikes! Just 'cause you know how doesn't mean you have to use all your tricks at the same time. This was a good story that tied onto the Bourne mythos and rebooted the movie franchise with actors who were terrific. Good action sequences and stunts also, so my advice to the director or directors of future Bourne (or will they be Cross?) flix is to trust the viewer to "get" the drama without adding in those cinematography gimmicks.

A pathetic attempt to revive one of the greatest spy movie series, The Bourne Series, The Bourne Legacy fails dishearteningly to revive and capture the thrill, drama and excitement of Jason Bourne travelling, hunted and hunting around the globe.....a hard-hitting black ops task- force suddenly and inadvertently turns into a viral infection movie portrayed in a disgusting script, horrible sequences, hilarious background music and pathetic action melodrama. The tension, thrill, excitement and excellent action sequences of the earlier Bourne movies was all-tops-down lost in this new reboot. Aaron Cash never looked deadly or an important CIA spy went wrong and the antagonist, LARX 3, though was introduced at a top notch killing machine ultimately turned into a comic punk kid in the way. I, personally being a huge fan of both Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner, unbiasedly will give Matt Damon the definite edge.....one thing has been very clear from the movie that Aaron Cash is no Jason Bourne and Tony Gilroy is no Paul Greengrass......What the hell was Tony Gilroy thinking????

When I first saw the preview for this movie, I was excited. I was hoping it would have traits similar to those that made The Bourne Identity such a good movie: enveloping story, strong lead role, and intense, yet cool action. This movie did not disappoint.This summer's new Bourne movie had a new face: that of Jeremy Renner. Although we were all used to Matt Damon as the lead awesome-super-agent role, Renner fills his shoes nicely and provides an overall great acting performance. I enjoyed hearing Renner, as Outcast agent Aaron Cross, give lengthy conversations about what they did to the agents in question and how that all tied into the big picture. Although there was action that was stylized after the original Bourne trilogy, there wasn't enough of it. There were a handful of scenes that showed off Cross's prowess with all sorts of weapons and machinery, but the fact that these scenes were few and far between left me wanting something more. The other portions of the movie were spent talking about the storyline, which if you haven't seen the original Bourne movies (and I mean recently), it will somewhat confuse you. Key phrases that tickle your memory of years past are thrown around like trifles and although you don't need to understand the story to enjoy the movie, it does help. If the story seems gray to you and you seem to be asking questions that sound like "Why are they killing them?" or "Why do they want to do that?", be quick to hold judgment and go watch/re-watch the original series.Everything is tied up nicely in the end (if you can call it "tied up") but although the movie is a good 2+ hours long, the ending is sudden. At least it was to me. I sat back and had to double check if those were credits I was seeing.All-in-all, this movie is definitely worth seeing, even if you've never seen the original Bourne trilogy. The story elements that tie into the original Bourne plot-line can be dismissed, and although the action scenes are limited they are cool and memorable. The Bourne Legacy is a step in the right direction towards a potential new Bourne trilogy.+2 for Renner's performance+1 for supporting cast+2 for superb action sequences+1 for storyline+1 for good springboard into possible new TrilogyNotes:  - Sometimes difficult to follow storyline due to frequent past-movie references - Quick and sudden ending - Few actions leave something to be wanted

Its almost unfortunate that BOURNE is attached to the movie.I think it made audiences feel it should be on par with Ultimatum, when I think what we are getting is IDENTITY in a parallel universe. Although I felt the story did a good job of tying the whole world together... There were some holes in the story. That said - I believe this is a start to much more. AND the movie itself was still very entertaining.Any story issues were well handled by Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weiz, and Ed Norton. All gave STELLAR performances. Renner's physical prowess left me exhausted and exhilarated all at the same time. The action sequences were really good and Renner looks better than he ever has.Marta (played my Weiz) was an exceptionally believable character. And Ed Norton just does a great job being a total bastard.You have to release any Matt Damon/ Jason Bourne expectation. The reality is it a different story with in the same world. And I do strongly believe it is a story worth looking into. My biggest issue with the movie is that we didn't dig deeper, just wider. I had hoped we could have seen more of the process of becoming and agent, a look into Aaron Cross' first assignments. The story mentions emotional noise from the outcome agents... show us! Even a little more of the back story of who Kenneth Kitsom was.Interestingly enough some of the trailers and previews shows scenes that didn't make the final cut. After seeing the movie three times. I have to say my love for the movie has grown. Between the first and second time I saw it - the movie opened up to me. I think I was no longer distracted about how this transition would work - and instead I was just pulled into the story. I am still displeased with the ending. A typical leave them hanging Bourne ending, but this was a little premature I think I felt like we needed just a little more resolution than this ending gave us. All in all Legacy really is a great and entertaining film. Renner and the whole cast were spectacular in their performance. I look forward to more from this series and hope we get the chance to dig deeper in upcoming installments.

Well, first of all, when the names change the movie will change! Critics don't understand this and put down a movie that is worth watching. I would guess that they are unhappy doing their job going to the movie on the cuff.. My movie house only charges 5 bucks so what the heck, I go often and enjoy the movie... YEA! The movie use's a lot of RECALL, which is a different movie, but it sets the idea that Bourne was only a small part of the Government that is out to kill whom ever gets in the way and that means YOU fella! You and I are only units that have to do what they want and if not, Global Hawk up yours. Better believe it! Some of the heavy duty stuff that the military use's is going to hit the street one of these days and you will say, I didn't know! As your bleeding out! Sure it is just a movie, just like the towers on fire and the central figure rescues all the women in danger, did not happen on 9/11 did it? If you were in there, you died. Movies use what is happening, only some of it you don't know about.. They only add the pretty girls and handsome men to excite you. Watched my copy of SALT that has my girl friend in it (only she don't know she is my girl friend) watch the interviews with people that were REAL spies...Great movie and I will go to see it again at the movie house.

Bourne legacy is a slow set of sequences with a few bursts of action scenes that results in one boring movie. Starting part of the movie is very slow at several instances. I ended up dosing off a few times in the initial parts and apparently, I wasn't alone doing that :-) The story of this sequel is designed to match with the previous series of Bourne movies. But in spite of having a good story line, overall, the movie was not entertaining. Near the end of movie, action sequences pick up and they have done a really good job there, but just when you feel movie starts to wake up the audience... it ends! This movie has one of the most abrupt endings that I had ever seen. By the time movie ended, we were not sure what happened. It was like the movie makers threw up their arms in air after first action sequence and decided "oh shoot! We just ran out of cash, pack up!"My suggestion: It would be better for you dosing-off at home than in theater! :-)

Story wise, The Bourne Legacy happens alongside the climax of Ultimatum, so when the Blackbriar and Treadstone operations comes to light, the other clandestine program 'Outcome' has to be shut down too. This result in killing all the agents & doctors involved in the program. Both Marta & Aaron are the two survivors from the program, and they seek out to liberation away from CIA. But to do that, Aaron has to viral out the blue capsule, which could be done only in Manila, Philippines. So they set out to Manila, viral out Aaron, run through the narrow lanes of Philippines, keep riding away from another assassin and eventually set out onto the sea escaping from the radar of CIA.Full review here - http://bit.ly/Mqu4jI

Now pay close attention: despite what the title says this is not a fourth entry that further chronicles the journey of Jason Bourne; instead this is a stand-alone film that exists in the same "realm" as the original Bourne series and features some of the same characters and circumstances. This time around the protagonist is Aaron Cross (Renner), a member of a CIA black ops program who becomes a marked man after the program overseer (Norton) decides to eliminate all assets, that is until Cross acquires help from a reluctant scientist (Weisz), thus making them both a target. Not as tense or engaging as you'd like it to be, with a plot that's often too convoluted for its own good, but fairly effective at times thanks to good pacing, inventive action scenes/stunts, and solid work from Renner and Weisz. **½

Did anyone notice they played it out with the same ending theme song as Ultimatum? Is this arrogance, or are they right in assuming no one will care? Jeremy tried his best to save the script with good acting (Rachel not so much) to no avail. The story had steep hills to climb in act I, which they solved lazily with POOP-TONS of dialogue. Now granted, I bitch when I see a redundant graphics like "ALASKA SECRET TRAINING FIELD SITE!" Don't get me started on dumbed-down writing. But I found myself dozing off to clichéd scenes, like "How do you sleep at night knowing you're creating super soldiers? I just want to be an average sensitive guy!" or, "I don't know what the secret drugs are for, I'm just the scared, hot scientist who makes them! But secretly I do know, I just need to cry for five minutes, then you can threaten to leave me behind!" Why certain reviewers see this as an attempt by Gilroy at being a great screenwriter, I don't get. It's straight off the shelf overwriting with signposted dialogue. Maybe this is DVD foresight -- who will buy it if all they remember is the complicated story? Actually, that's exactly why I buy a DVD. The story engrossed me. I need to see it again and again. That's why I don't own Avatar and never will, because "what story?" It's why I do own "Michael Clayton" which I can't believe he wrote, and not Bait, which I can.At first I thought he had a different ending planned if Matt Damon said "yes," but since he didn't, the ending just tapers off with James Cameron-like rote lines, ala, the powerful "I changed my mind." Overall it's a sophomoric, minimally funded effort on a now waning franchise.

I hope someday Bourne and Cross's path will cross. (They should team up and the "outcome" will be cool). An excellent spy movie. A good reboot. (This is like "Bourne Identity" for Aaron Cross).We should embrace the stereotype of Bourne Movies. (Same skill level of assassin & mobile chase in the end). They should make another one. (I don't know if Dr Rachel Weisz should die like Marie did).It is unfair to compare both characters. (Bourne is more quite while Cross is more outgoing). If you like spy movie you will like it. (Good for everyone who follow spy movies like me since the Three Days of the Condor (1975) Robert Redford). If you don't like spy movie there is a huge possibility that you will not like it. (Surely this is not a movie for everyone especially my wife and some of my friends). I'm a Bourne's fan.

SPOILERS IN MAIN BODY I don't understand a lot of the 5 and 6 star ratings other reviewers gave this film, only to say how really bad it was in their review. I won't make that mistake. This thing stinks. A 2 is generous.SPOILERS AHEAD I thought Bourne and his clones were supposed to be smart? If it's me and I have a tracking device that I've dug out of my leg, I'm throwing it in a river, crushing it with a rock, burning it up in a fire. NOT cramming it down a wolf's throat. By the way, taping a PIE PLATE over the GPS tracking device WILL NOT block the signal since it emits a signal in a 360 degree pattern. Then there is the "haunted house" in the woods. When you have to show a spiral staircase shot in a house with someone walking down the stairs to answer a routine phone call just to fill screen time, you know your in trouble. Oh, wait I know how to make this better. Let's throw in a whole bunch of redundant flashbacks and fill in drivel regarding the other Bourne movies. not so good. okay let's go from running in the woods to flying a plane. Did he steal the plane? rent it? Hijack it? And, oh yeah, let's throw in a scene of Renner changing clothes in the woods next to a car. None of these "scenes" do ANYTHING to drive the story forward. This film is a good example of what's wrong with Hollywood today and tells YOU the average theater goer, just how totally stupid they think you are.

Wow this movie was a waste of time. I thought they might have come up with something decent to add to the list of Bourne movies, but no! Your hopes will be crushed.This summer there were so many movies worth watching and this was clearly a movie worth avoiding. Instead see TED, Dark Knight, the Avengers, or Total Recall (movies I've seen that were worth it).Either the people putting together this Bourne movie (director/screenplay/writers) were changed or they took a mental vacation - its not even worth my time to verify this.The first three in the Bourne series were great - this movie was not.I hope I save at least one person out there!

Ike: The Bourne Legacy has a theatrical thumbprint like the others, but this isn't a bad thing. This thumbprint has steroids!Aaron Cross is stronger, faster, and quieter than our buddy Bourne. The writing is fast paced, leaving out a lot of the story with all the details. However, the action is heavier and faster and precisely what a majority of movie goers are looking for. This same type of sequel progression happened when we received Daniel Craig as 007. But don't misinterpret my comparison, I am not complaining.Tony Gilroy's visionary direction is like a linear line with the Bourne series, always going up. In every action movie Tony has directed, he is emphatic on making an emotional connection with viewers, an important ingredient in every successful movie. Even with more action and less dialogue he was able to accomplish just that in The Bourne Legacy. But dialogue loving freaks, screen writing nuts, and plot huggers beware twists aren't as prevalent in this one.One area that was strategically average was in the cinematography. Almost all the action scenes were heavily cut, mildly choppy, and close up creating a stronger sense of quicker action. By doing this you lose out on some real quality opportunities in the realm of action. The fight scenes are less sexy and more wham. But that is self admittedly petty in the grand scheme of things. The Bourne Legacy was extremely well done!***I am not just a science experiment, but steroids and adderall made me this wayCinematography: 7/10 Writing: 8/10 Acting: 9/10 Overall: 8.5/10The Rehash Critics -Ike

Car chases and foot races; boring! we've seen it in dozens of other movies - since the 1930's at least (when they were better done.) I swear that whole scenes in this movie have been lifted from other films. Merely having a few good actors (Renner, Weisz, Norton) in the movie cannot turn this sow's ear into a silk purse. Watching this film wasn't even painless (especially a mass murder scene that could have been lifted directly from today's headlines), but it most definitely was brainless. It also seems to have been made with a sharp eye on its budget. It's just less expensive to shoot parts of the film in an East Asian slum. And why is the great actor Albert Finney making a cameo appearance in this movie. Is he doing someone a favor, or is he down and out? I wonder what they are going to call the next sequel in this series, "The Bourne Repetition"?

Any user who rated this movie 7 and above is just a classic Bourne fans, nothing useful for your reference. This preview will based on the comparison of all previous 3 Bourne Trilogy. The previous Bourne Trilogy can be so successful due to the solid stunt acts and spy-alike- conspiracy. The movie has good acting, good story line but the major stunt looks downgraded, especially in the fighting. In Bourne Trilogy there'll be always a famous stunt guy to act as the nemesis of Bourne (aka the final boss), while in this movie the nemesis looks scary + non-emotion (as usual) but wielded less than 10 punches and died in the most ridiculous and the funniest way. The core stunt is basically a cat and mouse bike chase, take down a few guards, police, and agents. The best part of the movie that you wanted to fast forward to is the fight at the mansion, the rest you may skip ahead. I would recommend to buy or rent a DVD instead of wasting the reasonable money and time in the cinema.

Acting is very good Actors are very great but i don't feel watching a Bourne movie..lacks background music.the policemen in the movie is using a very uncommon Tagalog? very un natural for me, but fight scenes are very superb, specially the chase on the rooftops are awesome..the car chase is very great! like when they rammed the jeepny and the jeepney was going sideways?? that was great another thing.. i did'nt know that we had a Toyota Camry as a police car? LOL...i liked when they rammed the Honda civic and the Mitsubishi galant!! cool but the story really lacks.. i hope it was done by the real Jason Bourne (matt Damon) because in the books. it was David Webb who is doing the action! i really love Rachel Weisz!!! :D

I REALLY wanted this to work because this one of my top 5 film series of all time and i have been a HUGE fan since the beginning... Sadly ... VERY SADLY it didn't come close and it hurts. Lets face it the other films were AWESOME!!! and this change-up without authentic author written material just had "FAIL" written all over it from the onset and Damon knew it. Truth be told if they just introduced this film as a new film un- associated with the Bourne trilogy it would be an OK film, but don't pit a Yugo against three finely tuned Ferrari's. It didn't fool anyone.The core problem is it is this film fails miserably while pretending to replicate the same balance, pace and intensity of the three predecessors. Its just not there... you want it to be and you can feel the film trying but its nothing more than lipstick on a pig and you can feel it midway through the movie.The earlier films were in your face gritty and this one was Hollywood diet-grit due to a weak script and too many other minor deviations from the original formula. In addition to the weak and a repetitively themed script, liberties with other low-key casting choices from other films just gave this boat another anchor. Why add Norton and Weiss? Like Bourne himself the earlier casting choices minus Julia Stiles were somewhat off the grid choices. Weiss just didn't fit at all... and Norton has been amazing in other movies but i will take a Conklin, Abbott or Landy any day of the week over his re-hash character.The cinematography also felt noticeably more Hollywood than Bourne style unfortunately or else i was already clouded with disappointment and anger.The good is that Renner did not try to become Bourne in the movie, he was his own character and i liked what he brought, but even his madd skills couldn't get this thing close to the same league as the other films.I've always envied Matt Damon's decision making when it comes to choosing movie scripts. Initially i really really wanted him to stay with the series no matter what, but after seeing this one now, he once again made the right call by staying on the side line. Verdict: Renner big thumbs up but sadly this film had big shoes to fill and never got its feet in.If you can't do it well why do it all???

The Bourne films are entertaining, having Damon as a lead lends depth to the mysterious agents. This time Jeremy Renner gives us a more visceral force, and though he's not Superman, he certainly demonstrates that his abilities are special.In this entry Renner is facing extermination, and he is survival mode for most of the story. Mostly, he is on his own. For the second half of the story he teams up with Dr. Shearing (Weisz), one of the people behind the project who finds herself facing death because of her association to Cross and other agents.There are some thrilling scenes in the film; some remind us of the tension in Alaska, a place where beauty and danger seem to exist harmoniously, and it doesn't hurt to have a computer-operated drone to raise the tension levels for a couple of the super soldiers.We visit a few worldwide locations as Col Byer (Norton) expects a clean resolution to his orders. Norton matches Renner in the intensity scale, though his role is different as he represents authority and is ready to justify the means in order to achieve his goals. Everyone of his words drips with authority, arrogance, and there is no room for interpretation or argument.The final part of the movie has some exciting chases in the heart of Manila, as we see Cross try to escape one very surprising, last-minute adversary, who might prove to be his match. It is in this part that the direction weakens a little because executing this type of scene must be very difficult. It is not bad at all, but there are moments when the editing falters a little bit, and that might weaken the overall effect of this confrontation. The best thing about the film is that it leaves us with a taste for more proving the fact that as long as there is charisma and talent involved, combined with a hero and a villain that are almost equal matches, we do care about what happens up in the screen.

This film is recommended.The spy thriller has come of age in recent years, bringing with it enough violence and explosions to permanently dull one's senses with its onslaught of hair-raising stunt work, kinetic chases, and exaggerated leaps off buildings that would maim or kill any mere human being. With the body count ever increasing, so must the dare-devil exploits. This genre continually tops itself to produce cheap thrills for its adrenaline-deprived audience members as it sacrifices logical leaps and sensible plotting for the sheer ride of it all. The goal seems to be: the more convoluted and fast-paced, the better the end result.The spy too has become a superstar without the super powers usually given to the comic book hero ( yet another genre that has gained popularity lately ). He usually has formidable survival instincts, neat gadgets, and undeniable strength to help him succeed at foiling the villain at all costs. This tried-and-true formula is set and really to be unleashed in the latest venture entitled The Bourne Legacy, a follow-up to the profitable Bourne trilogy ( without Matt Damon in the lead role as super agent Jason Bourne ).One can easily say that its central hero has been " re-bourne " in this most recent installment to the billion dollar action thriller series as Jeremy Renner takes over as our new protagonist. Renner plays Aaron Cross, one of a series of genetically enhanced agents like Bourne. Think of a bionic man gone rogue, minus the superhero status or mythology. As the agency tries to rein all of its covert operatives, Cross moves from one location to the next, from one thrilling escape to yet another.Story-wise, the film jumps around at such a frenzied pace that it becomes disconcerting. Various ideas pop up with new villains in various locales. Nothing makes a great deal of sense whenever the script tries to merge the old with the new. It doesn't successfully align the previous films with its new cast of characters and their undercover missions, but it tries. And tries. And tries. When we last saw Bourne (as in Jason ), he had plummeted into the dark watery grave never to be seen again. The Bourne Legacy begins with that similar image, except this time, it's Aaron who emerges from the cold waters. The correlation is totally intentional as the film repeatedly links the previous pedigree shamelessly. This recognition factor seems to be everyone's covert mission. Back in service with what amounts to token cameo roles written just to reinforce that Outcome are such fine actors like Albert Finney, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, and Scott Glenn. They all look dreadfully serious, waste their talents in a short speech, and earn that hefty paycheck.Inspired by Robert Ludlum's novels and directed by Tony Gilroy ( who also wrote the screenplay for this film and the previous Bourne series ), The Bourne Legacy is more of the same. It's generic repackaging, but a very well-made action film. The film is devoid any real emotional power and not as effective as the earlier efforts, but it remains standard high- concept fare. ( In those more involving films, one cared about the hero and the political fallout with its characters. With "old" Bourne, who is always referred to in this film but never materializes, the moviegoer was piecing together his repressed identity as a trained assassin just as he was. Here, Cross already knows who he is and his career choices, so the plot is rather simplistic for our "new" hero and the movie-going audience: it's escape, keep movin', or be killed. )The talented Renner isn't given that much to do in the acting department except to run, jump, and shoot, which he does quite efficiently. He also develops a nice rapport with Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing. Their scenes together heighten the suspense level and give the film some merit. Edward Norton brings enough menace to his role as Colonel Byer, the mastermind involved in the behind-the-scenes scenario. With all the C.I.A. cover-ups, betrayals, and killings, the film loses its ways with its talky exposition and unnecessarily intricate plotting. But what makes The Bourne Legacy worthy of viewing is the well-staged and choreographed action sequences, which, pardon the pun, are on overkill. Especially exciting are a shoot-out midway through the film and a solidly directed climactic motorcycle chase that builds tension effectively.This most recent installment continually entertains and production values are top-notch. Gilroy knows how to keeps the story moving, even if his script ( co-written with his brother, Dan ) plods along more than soars. As action thrillers go, The Bourne Legacy doesn't leave much to the imagination, but it does lead the way for other future chapters in the series. And the money kept rolling in.

THE BOURNE LEGACY (2012) ***1/2 Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton, Stacy Keach, Scott Glenn, Zeljko Ivanek, Albert Finney, Dennis Boutskiaris, Joan Allen, David Strathairn. Revved up chapter in the ongoing spy franchise this time without Matt Damon (although his image is floated about) instead focusing on another candidate for the undercover secret project to make a super soldier in this case Aaron Cross (intense Renner at his best) who learns of the nefarious underpinnings while attempting to stay alive long enough for exposure of the powers that be with unlikely help from one of his doctors/scientists enlisted to the project (Weisz slipping in effectively). Written and directed by Tony Gilroy (who penned the previous BOURNE flicks with his brother Dan) fits like a glove (a velvet once with an iron fist) in delivering a dense and at times very chatty exposition flowing auctioneer that thankfully kicks into gear with some truly hair-raising awesome stunt works namely a secluded house invasion and one of the best cinematic motorcycle chases ever committed to celluloid ala THE FRENCH CONNECTION. Long live "BOURNE" .

Well just seen The Bourne Legacy.It really was a pile of tosh. Really awful direction, dreadful acting and a mere hint of the previous incumbents does not warrant a Bourne film. It's rather akin to a Bond film without Bond. They obviously thought by using the previous names like Bourne, Kramer and Landy it would be a success. Well, no..... Poor and lame attempt to follow on three otherwise great films. Not really worth the cinema time. Just leave to the experts! You would also think by listing Pamela Landy in the titles you think she had a big part...no she didn't. It really is The Bourne Redundancy. The first thirty minutes of the film is really yawnful and the use of previous footage is somewhat an insult as they think this just makes everything stick. Bring Back Matt Damon.

but I liked it. It's not perfect but it fits in with the other three Bourne movies just fine. I didn't think any of them were perfect, either. In some ways, this one is superior to the others.Certain conventions used; for example, the explanation of the science could have been done slightly differently although of course it was needed.Locales selected were brilliant. Scenery in the Alaskan wilderness appeared to be digitally enhanced. If not, cinematographer deserves an Oscar for this movie. Acting and dialog were first-rate except maybe the scene where she is explaining the science to the experiment. She sure makes the thing she loves sound like a J.O.B., there.I love a chase scene as much as anyone. Parts of this one were great. Without giving away specifics the need to make the greatest chase scene of all times appears to be irresistible to directors. Manila was perfect for it, though.It's a good piece of work and I am certain no one associated with it has any doubts.

Yes it isn't Matt Damon, that's right. It's an attempt to prolong an excellent series. Okay so let's watch the movie. I scanned the reviews before I saw the movie and went in thinking I'd be disappointed. After the bloated Dark Night, and the slightly less bloated Total Recall I expected to be checking my watch 90 minutes in as I did with those offerings, but when Bourne 4 ended I felt disappointed that it was ending. It is very fast moving, the action is excellent, the script is a brave attempt to weave the previous films into a new take on the series and I didn't find it poor, clichéd or in any way offensive. The acting was very good except for one scene where Rachel Weiz went distractingly over the top but she was otherwise so good that that was easily forgiven.What's wrong with the movie? I couldn't tell you. It went past like a freight train, was very entertaining and what else can you ask for?

I will keep my review straight and to the point. Watch the first three films (as I did) then go watch The Bourne Legacy. The movie just doesn't feel the same. No adrenaline, no amazing gun scenes (ok the house was decent), followed by the weakest ending I could imagine. Really? The guy on the bike was supposed to be the best agent they ever put into the field and yet he gets ousted by the doctor. Where is the agent on agent fight scenes? Where is the brink of death feeling and close calls? No wonder Matt didn't want anything to do with this film. The first Bourne film I almost fell asleep watching. What a disappointment.

Now I wasn't really hyped about this sequel or anything like that but had some expectations. Cause the past 3 Bourne movies were actually good. With good amount of action and intelligent that can get more convoluted than it has to but it's still a great action franchise. Now this one doesn't have Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) in it, since he probably declined the offer to be in this sequel. And is now replaced by Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross. And there is also Rachel Weisz as the tag along girl for the main guy on the run from a big corporation that wants them both dead. Now the acting from the two including Edward Norton is spot on good. Edward Norton is the new head of Treadstone after Alexander Conklin. And he barks orders most of the way through in this. This whole movie is basically the bad guys trying to cover things up and get rid of any loose ends, even if it means killing people. The other Bourne movies were the same but this one is more direct about it, while lacking the cleverness of the previous movies. When this movie ends however it feels like it's missing quite a bit. It's a Bourne movie but it just didn't seem to have enough action as well. Leaving room for sequels is alright as long as the movie is satisfying but that isn't the case here. It just felt like a set up for the next movie in this franchise without it being satisfying. A good way to leaver room for a sequel is when the movie itself is satisfying but you anticipate and crave for the next movie. That just isn't the case for this one. The story in this isn't even as intelligent as it tries to make it seem. Overall this movie isn't terrible but for a Bourne movie, it doesn't have much to make it stand out.6/10

I've noticed a lot of poor reviews for The Bourne Legacy and admittedly some of the criticisms are spot on. However much of the negativity is really based on a knit picky critiques. I agree that this movie isn't as good as any of the three films starring Matt Damon. But I think time might be kind to this movie after more of the story is told in future movies.It seemed to me that The Bourne Legacy was a transition film. It dug deeper into what had been presented in the three previous movies of the franchise, added new characters, and set up future story lines. Hence the story took a little time to develop unlike the other three movies which put the peddle to the metal right from the start.Renner was great as Aaron Cross. I liked that Cross had a little sense of humor and wasn't a carbon copy of the Jason Bourne character. Bourne barely talks, whereas Cross had dialogue and seemed to have a slightly different skill set to Bourne. He got into the program with and under performing IQ score and needs the meds the program provides as much for confidence as to the actual enhancements they provide.Wietz was also great in her role. Her character provides a very interesting partner in crime to Renner's Cross.I found the movie very engaging. The storyline may not be as fascinating as Jason Bourne's where he has to figure out who he is and what the program he is involved in is all about. We know all this from his storyline. The story of Aaron Cross is different, yet I found it a lot of fun because it parallels the timeline of Bourne's. Never in film have I seen a sequel/prequel (not really what this movie is but for lack of a better term) where the timeline runs alongside that of preceding films. If rumor is true that Damon will reprise his role in perhaps the next film to join Cross, then I think The Bourne Legacy has successfully continued the story.I had high hopes for the film and I really enjoyed it. I'd like to give the franchise a longer leash than a lot of critics have and see what the next film is like and how Legacy fits into the broader scheme of the entire story. I say give this one a go. Rating 8 of 10 stars.

I walked out of the screening of The Bourne Legacy feeling empty. Yes, the action scenes were good, but not as memorable as the original trilogy; yes, Jeremy Renner was good, but not as memorable as Matt Damon; yes, Ed Norton was good as the villain, but he wasn't as intimidating as Chris Cooper, and he wasn't on screen as much. The Bourne Legacy is the perfect example of a film that tries to kick-start a new chapter in an old series when the old series already went off on a high note and didn't need any new additions. The Bourne Legacy pretty much begins towards the end of The Bourne Ultimatum, with clips from the original trilogy popping up here and there just to tell the audience that they're still in a Bourne movie, except with no Jason Bourne. There's some techno babble, and some chase scenes, but every aspect of this film feels recycled, and carries that feeling that it's all been done before, except much better. In the end I thought the movie was okay, but seeing how hyped I was to see this film, makes even more disappointing. Hopefully, if they make a sequel, it'll be better than this painfully average film.Final Verdict: 5/10

As we glean from the title, "Bourne Legacy" is about discovering what the highly trained CIA agents can do to sort of live up to Jason Bourne (i.e. Matt Damon).While I don't think Jeremy Renner quite achieves Damon's level (part of it is we don't really understand Renner's motive to fight back against the CIA other than the fact that they tried to kill him and he needs pills), Renner does strike an imposing figure from the very beginning as you watch him go through his training program. He seems to at least be up to the task and we should get a better understanding of what he can do in subsequent film(s).Because make no mistake, writer/director Tony Gilroy appears to be planning at least one more film after seeing the ending to 'Legacy'. It ends so abruptly that when the score came up signaling the end, I had to check the time because I had no idea the 125 minute run time was up.People will complain about the incomplete story (the film felt as if it could continue for another 60 minutes easy) but if you look at it in the context of there being more films, there should be no problem with it.Where this movie delivers is in its initial storyline and the intelligent writing throughout the script. The premise of genomic enhancement feels very real considering our time. The way the film incorporates that and the new CIA programs like Outcome and Larx, to me, is gripping. One of the biggest appeals to me of this series has been learning about the assassins and in this film you feel as if they are getting better and stronger even if you don't really see whether they truly are. The film does an outstanding job for the first 60 minutes of tying in what was happening as the third film came to a close and in the days immediately following.Where the film lacks is a clear understanding of what Cross's motives are. We understand him trying to evade the CIA after they try to eliminate him but do his motives end with his cycling off medication and going into hiding? Is there something more that Cross wishes to achieve? All of these agents enter the program they are in because they want to help their country, even Jason Bourne had this motive, so perhaps something will occur to awaken that desire once again.Renner is good, Rachel Weisz is outstanding (very refreshing to have a good actress alongside the leading assassin) and Edward Norton does a solid job as Col. Eric Beyer leading the clean-up team at the CIA.You see potential for more from Cross and it's intriguing to me to see what developments Gilroy will have in store for us. I hope we haven't seen the last of Jason Bourne (and Damon) in action, though. It'd be nice to see a Cross/Bourne partnership to accomplish some task whether it's aiding the CIA or helping to expose the poor leadership once and for all, etc.

Pointless entry into the Bourne series finds Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz taking over where Matt Damon left off in a sequel that lacks not only a real purpose to exist but lacks a script that can justify the movie as a continuation of the series. Tony Gilroy (who had a hand in screen writing the original three films) writes and directs this entry but forgets the showmanship and grace that Paul Greengrass and Doug Liman brought to the series, not to mention the solid storytelling that came with their efforts. Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz tried their best with the weak material Gilroy provides for them and they almost succeed, giving the audience something to care for but they are fighting an uphill battle against cliché one dimensional characters, dismal screen writing, a running time that needed to be edited down and amateurish direction that does no one any favors. The rest of the cast barely registers at all and the action is not even on the same level of the other films in the series.If any blame should go around, it should go squarely to Tony Gilroy and his brothers, who seem like they had no idea on what the hell they were doing and in the process, wasted the time of two great actors (Renner and Weisz) who are working beyond what is necessary to give the fans the respect they deserve for staying with the series. This was a hard thing to do considering that they are working with nothing in terms of support.

I could candy coat this and tell you I loved this film, but I won't because I didn't. I thought it was rather poorly written. However the saving grace was the actors themselves that pulled this out of the crapper in my opinion. Nothing new was added here except another layer to the Treadstone, Black Briar, and other Government absurdities from the other three movies. This sequel deals with genetics and DNA manipulation and since this is mentioned in the trailer, there is no spoiler alert needed. These genetic mutations were supposed to eliminate the inconsistencies that existed with Jason Borne (also in the trailer) and the operatives in his program. The way they dealt with how they supposedly "fixed" the inconsistencies is really what was made this an unbelievable script. However, the action and the acting of the two lead characters Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner make this movie tolerable. There was no reason to cast people like Stacey Keach or Edward Norton to this cast as they added no value other than their name to this film. Really, any no name actor could have provided the same quality to this film without having to pay for these actors. The plot wasn't too hard to follow, but be prepared for a few flashbacks to the other three movies, which to me, upsets the flow to the movie. The only reason I think they put them in in the first place was for people who may not have seen the other three Borne movies. Other than that, I don't think they're needed. I wouldn't waste admission price or popcorn on this movie. I only saw it because it was only $5 at the drive in and you got to see another movie after it went off so it didn't cost me that much. Don't worry, it will keep until it comes out on Netflix or Redbox, and then you can watch it without worrying that you are throwing away your money.

In its purest form, "The Bourne Legacy" is a film that in a little over two hours tells the audience exactly what the trailer conveys—that "Bourne was just the tip of the iceberg." In this film, we follow a new agent named Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) who is physically and psychologically enhanced. The film follows a familiar storyline to other Bourne movies, in which an agency executive and his/her team of keyboard wizards try their best to find a highly-skilled agent running "willy nillly" around the globe. Accredited and well known actor, Edward Norton fits nicely into this role as Eric Byer who's only characteristic is that he cuts straight to the chase in order to avoid all possible collateral damage. Bourne Legacy also takes notes from The Bourne Identity and involves a female partner. The lucky lady in this film is Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who works in a bio-medical super lab in order to help create and maintain the genetics needed to keep agents such as Cross, genetically enhanced. When Byer decides to shut down the genetic program and destroy any active agents, Cross narrowly avoids death and begins to search for Dr. Shearing who he knows will be able to help him find more gene-altering pills in order to find answers and survive the onslaught of trained operatives set on killing him and the doctor. Cross and Shearing travel around the globe to find answers and when they do, all hell breaks loose and both have to fight, gun, and ride their way to safety. Tony Gilroy, an original screenwriter for all three of the previous Bourne films, daringly attempts to write and direct a film that merges a new original story with Bourne's final days in the "Bourne Ultimatum" storyline. Unfortunately, the film, in so many ways, becomes an unfortunate mess.It should be said that I am a massive Bourne trilogy fan. The original three films were great and ended in great fashion. Therefore, when Bourne Legacy was announced, I immediately had my doubts. Perhaps Bourne Legacy's first fatal flaw is that the film is entirely confused on who is more important—our new main character, Cross—or the Treadstone "messiah" himself, Jason Bourne. The first half of the film cuts between Cross camping in the mountains for no apparent reason and Byer tossing around policies and theories in which the audience has no idea what he is talking about. The Bourne films have always been known to be confusing and complex involving the CIA, US Senators, etc. yet the Bourne Legacy attempts to replicate the same complexity, however fails in execution. Instead, the story is confusing in the least attractive or interesting way. At times, I couldn't help but cringe a little at how hard Gilroy's story was trying to match its predecessor.It wasn't until the second half of the movie that Legacy felt anything remotely like a Bourne film. Filled with the same deadly combat we all came to love in the original films, Renner shows that he can match Damon's showmanship in the "kicking ass" department, which was a welcome sight. Furthermore, Renner also flaunts his motorcycle driving skills in the film's only chase scene which seems to drag on into eternity. Although, the film's action sequences were impressive and entertaining, it was the little nuances that were completely unnecessary to both Bourne fans and the average movie-goer. Small aspects such as an enemy's ability to survive multiple bullet wounds, Shearing's over the top emotional cries and yelps, and Cross's lack of focus or "super-agent poise" was endlessly distracting and took away the little momentum the film had. Now aside from comparing the film to its Damon predecessors, the acting and writing was sub-par at best. Although the cast featured many experienced actors, only Norton and Renner seemed to bring any actual ability to the stage and the characters they were playing. However, it was certainly the writing that seemed to bring everyone down. There were many emotional one liners that Renner's character spit out that seemed completely out of place in an espionage film. A super-agent is supposed to have composure and poise and yet Renner's script played at the opposite. Yet, perhaps the most painful of all writing and acting was Weisz's role. Although I do understand that the character was in an emotional position after being close to death many times, any genuine emotion from Weisz's character could not be found—even amidst the yelling and crying found too often in the film. In the end, the over the top emotion and mediocre writing felt odd and several times, laughable. Near the end of the film, Weisz's character asks Cross if they are lost. Despite Cross's actual response, I cannot help but think that "lost" is the best way to describe Gilroy's attempt to extend the series further. Although entertaining and a fun cinematic adventure, Bourne Legacy becomes just another action flick that will soon be forgotten by its audience and any hopeful Bourne fans. However, Legacy's biggest flaw is the aforementioned fact that a two hour film was produced to reveal relatively nothing about Bourne, Gilroy's new character, or the popular story arc created in Damon's Bourne trilogy. As an audience, you cannot help but feel like the film takes you around in pointless circles and therefore, lost couldn't be any better of a term to describe the pile of espionage scrap Tony Gilroy found in the bottom of the—already empty— Bourne barrel.

Tony Gilroy decides to take the director's seat in the next establishment of the Bourne series. Despite not having Matt Damon running the show, there is an impressive lead from Jeremy Renner, alongside the always dashing Rachel Weisz. With very intense action sequences and an intellectual script, this film has itself going...until the plot kicks in. Unfortunately, Gilroy isn't really able to bring the stories together, with Renner trying to run away from Treadstone, but trying to get from them the substances that made him strong and smart, and Norton trying to stop the media from getting more information that Bourne and Pam Landy let loose. If you're going out to see an action film, you might want to skip this one, especially when 10 minutes of the 135 minute film are action. Now, if you love a film filled with dialog and great acting, then this is the one.This film proves that the Bourne series is at its end, but is still entertaining.

"300: Rise of an Empire" will be no surprise in delivery other than it is possibly better than the first? There will, still, be fight scenes reminiscent of flawless dance moves, and the great choreography is what lends the film to being a great 'dance' movie (hello Step-Up 3hundred). The difference in approach comparatively between the two films would be the perverse nature of the second's delivery of the story at hand. The first had a far more romantic predisposition.The story is more or less the same - Persians are descending onto Greece and taking over. The epicenter for the second take on the Persian take over is Athens and its people. The men are not as perfectly ripped as the Spartans. The soldiers are made up of various sized men (but there's still a great amount of shiny muscle) and not nearly as romantic in appearance as the perfect Spartans.The sex scene is more sadomasochistic and less love making. The passion between "King Leonidas" and his queen in "300" is filled with affection and attachment whereas the scene in "300: Rise of an Empire" is riddled with force, power and control. The sexual tension in both scenes are similar in sexual tension but both portray a very different tone, one more romantic than the other.The lighting is impeccable and the story lent well to the way in which the 3D was utilized. Instead of aspects 'popping' out at you they seemed to go deep. The landscapes had so much depth that it was hard not to make the correlation between the depth "300: Rise of an Empire" was reaching to in terms of the Persian take over. As it was not the next installment of "300" but more insight into the original story, as the story goes deeper than Sparta and the army of 300. Eva Green is outrageously good and compelling to watch and to some degree is the "Leonidas" of "Rise of an Empire". Not to say that Sullivan Stapelton was overshadowed but his role was more meticulous and thought out, very much like the Queen in "300". The two pull the opposite sides of a war story firmly together. Not to mention how smoking hot both of them are.Like the first, "Rise of an Empire" is undoubtedly clothed in beauty, from the moonlighting to the muscled bodies, the supple breasts to the eloquent sprays of blood, the film is about an aesthetic which is part of the story. Is it masking a lack of story? definitely not, it is the story. "300" was ground breaking at the time of release, "Rise of an Empire" merely perfects that first step into a world of a different, and maybe more enigmatic, way of story telling. 7.5/10

When Zack Snyder's 300 was screened back in 2006, the effects-heavy ancient epic was one-of-a-kind cinematic experience. It became such a beloved fan-favorite movie that many filmmakers tried to imitate the similar stylized technique (e.g. the super slow-motion, actors and props against computer-generated background, CGI blood-and-gore) with varying degree of success. Now, in this long-gestating sequel/side-quel, I originally never expected much from 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE. After all, I thought the movie will be probably more of the same. However, upon finally watching the movie at the exclusive IMAX 3D sneak preview, I was surprised that the movie lives up beyond my low expectation.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE tells the other side of the story where Greek general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) leads his army against Artemisia (Eva Green) on a naval battle by the sea, while King Leonidas (Gerard Butler, only appeared in recycled footage from 300) and his Spartan warriors engaged in their ill-fated battle against King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his Persian army on the land.THE GOOD STUFFPrior to 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE, veteran Israeli commercials director-turned-feature filmmaker Noam Murro only has the 2008's dramedy, SMART PEOPLE to his credit. However, Murro manages to handle his first big budget studio production like a seasoned pro. Here, Murro proves to be an accomplished visual stylist like Zack Snyder himself (who only returned as one of the screenwriters and producers) after all. With the help of cinematographer Simon Duggan, Murro successfully recreates Snyder's stylized display of slow-motion violence and gore while his mix of fluid and gritty camera-work are put into good use. Thanks also to Murro's energetic direction, the action scenes -- especially the one involved the naval battle -- are electrifying. Other technical credits, including Junkie XL's throbbing score with a dash of sizzling Middle Eastern beat, are equally first-rate.Zack Snyder's and Kurt Johnstad's screenplay is effective, especially the way it juggles between the main premise surrounding the naval engagement and several flashbacks/backstories without making them heavy-handed.Cast-wise, Rodrigo Santoro is typically imposing as the ruthless King Xerxes while Lena Headey made adequate use of her limited screen time as Queen Gorgo. But it was Eva Green who steals the show with her wicked performance as Artemisia. In fact, it's simply refreshing to see a female actor commands the screen in this otherwise male-dominated movie.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The scene where Themistocles and his Greek army manage to outwit Artemisia and her crew by making their ships stumbled between the rocks, and another one where Artemisia stages a brilliant plan by creatively using oil to trap and blow up Themistocles' ships (you simply have to see it for yourself). Both of these well-staged strategies are particularly fascinating to watch for.MOST MEMORABLE QUOTEQueen Gorgo: You've come a long way to stroke your cock while real men train!THE BAD STUFFThe absence of Gerard Butler is sorely missed in 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE (his character is supposed to be featured here in the original script, but forced to cut out because Butler declined to return). After all, his iconic role as the fearless Spartan leader King Leonidas is simply unforgettable. But all can be forgiven if a new leading role is engaging enough to carry the movie. Unfortunately, Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton isn't really the one. Although he has the impressive physique, Stapleton looks somewhat bland and noticeably lack of rugged charm and commanding presence that Butler previously displayed very well in 300.But the major flaw here is the anticlimactic finale that ends abruptly before the credit rolls. I mean, is it really necessary to make way for an open ending?FINAL WORDSFor those who are disappointed with the lackluster results of recent ancient epic failures (THE LEGEND OF THE HERCULES, POMPEII), 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE proves that this particular genre can stand tall if done right.

What a tremendous movie. I did not expect so much Entertainment. Not so far. I had liked 300, seven years ago. And was not so excited to Watch the sequel. Eva Green is here absolutely terrific, outstanding as the evil female. But for whom the audience may feel some empathy. Do not forget that her character seeks revenge long after her whole family rape and murder. I would bet till my last cent that no one IMDb comment will ever emphasize that point of view. Yes, I love Eva Green's character. That's what astonishes me most in this film, more than the battle and bloody fights sequences. I have always loved amazons features. I am not interested in submitted - oh yes my Darling ! - females. That makes me puke. Run to see that fabulous film.

In recent years, Gerard Butler has disappeared into a stream of forgettable, lacklustre movies - which is what's so surprising about how much he's missed in 300: Rise Of An Empire. It's not like he could come back, anyway, since his character met such a grisly, noble death in Zack Snyder's genre-defying, blood-guts-and-glory epic 300. And yet, this 'equal' - the narrative takes place before, during and after 300 - noticeably suffers without the brute-force charisma of his inspirational Spartan King Leonidas. Fortunately, Eva Green steps in and fills his shoes (sandals?) admirably well as the antagonist of the piece, even though the film meticulously constructed around her might not be entirely worthy of her efforts.While Leonidas and his 300 men do battle on land to hold off the invading forces of Persian god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), the Athenians are worried about the looming threat of war at sea. General Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) and his army of farmers and poets cannot be assured of help or reinforcements from the other Greek city-states. This failure to unite the disparate forces of Greece seems to hand certain victory to the enemy: the Persians possess a far superior naval fleet commandeered by the vengeful, ruthless Artemisia (Green) - who, for dark reasons of her own, will not rest until Greece is wiped from the face of the earth.The curious thing about 300: Rise Of An Empire is how it manages to be, in one fell swoop, better and worse than its predecessor. On the plus side, it has considerably more story-telling ambition, expanding the scope of its tale to encompass historical context that simply wasn't required in 300. This is mostly done well, although the exposition-heavy opening speech by stately Spartan Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) might prove more confusing than enlightening. When the film settles into its groove, however, it actually proves quite fascinating to piece together the twists and turns that led up to Leonidas' last stand against Xerxes, and to realise how this epic battle is but one small thread in the entire tapestry of war between Greece and Persia.But the film's Grecian protagonists are also considerably less compelling than Leonidas and his brave 300. Themistokles is a frustratingly colourless presence on his own, and his moments of purportedly heart-rending brotherhood with his lieutenants - played to great operatic effect in 300 - never amount to much. He brings young Calisto (Jack O'Connell) into the war, despite the objections from his buddy Scyllias (Callan Mulvey), who just happens to be Calisto's father. But the lessons learnt by father and son are rote rather than rousing. As a result, the film lacks the visceral emotional impact that would lend weight to its many scenes of frequent, over-the-top blood-letting. 300: Rise Of An Empire also shades, a few too many times, into unintentionally funny territory ("ROCKS!!!"), which derails the narrative and makes it harder for the film to find its metaphorical footing again.Fortunately, everything about the film improves by leaps and bounds each time Artemisia strides on screen (which, thankfully, happens quite a lot). The film may be based on Frank Miller's graphic novel Xerxes, but it should more rightfully take its name from this warrior who conducts the bloodshed and mayhem like she would an orchestra, with easy, ruthless determination. As Artemisia, Green radiates ice and coldness - she has the bearing and look of someone frozen in her rage - even as she boils with the earthy heat of vengeance. Stapleton, who looks beautiful but doesn't really manage to communicate the soul of his character, comes properly to life in his scenes with Green, particularly in a bruising encounter onboard her "barge" in which their bloodlust becomes something quite literal.Aesthetically, the film is often quite lovely to look at, although one can't help but wonder whether director Noam Murro might have gone a bit too far in trying to recapture the bold, unusual, heightened look that so defined 300. His many, many battles - all digitally created - are bathed in grim, highly-contrasted colours, arcs of blood black in the dying light. After a while, it becomes somewhat monotonous, even when ships clash and men tumble to their deaths on a regular basis.What 300 most lacks amidst its testosterone-fuelled blend of bravery and bravado is a stronger feminine presence. On that count, 300: Rise Of An Empire has a great deal more going for it. Artemisia remains fierce and powerful in her own right throughout the film, sparring with Themistokles in an equally-weighted battle of brains and brawn. Headey, too, has much more to do than she did in 300. It's somewhat sad, then, that their male counterparts can't quite hold up their bits of the film. Otherwise, this new installment in the 300 franchise might have found itself in the enviable position of outshining its predecessor. Instead, it's a rather compelling, if not entirely successful, attempt to look beyond the courage and sacrifice of Leonidas' intrepid 300.

FILM AUTHORITY REVIEWS 300: Rise of an EmpireA rare sequel that matches up to the original film, 300: Rise of an Empire is a brisk romp through the history books, filtered through the comic book imagination of Frank Miller and the bloody cinematic CGI heavy vision of Zack Snyder. Interestingly, the events depicted in Noah Munro's film wrap around the battle seen in the first film; the Spartans are seen heading off the Hot Gates 20 minutes in, and news of their sacrifice is received around the hour mark. The focus is wider, and begins with the birth of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Popping out of the pool at 12 feet tall, the mortal turned god is mainly a peripheral figure as the Greeks, led by Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) ramp up for a sea-battle with the Persians. The Persian forces are under the control of Artemesia (Eva Green), whose backstory is fully explained through a graphic scene in which she watches her family raped and murdered. Trained as a warrior, she's a worthy adversary for Themistokles, and they even get it on romantically, although the sex is anything but gentle. With Snyder co-writing and producing, 300: Rise of an Empire is very much more of the same in terms of bare-chested speeches and heavy bouts of narration, but the epic sea battles are freshly presented, and the spectacle is huge throughout. Green and Stapleton both fill out their roles with venom, and gouts of gore spray over decks, extras and the camera lens; the promise of a 'tide of blood' is delivered on, including a choice decapitation. 300; Rise of an Empire is a rattling good watch for those who enjoyed the first film. With plenty of plot-lines left hanging, there's plenty of scope for the franchise to continue after this solid, impressively handled entry. The Film Authority

Eva Green performs an iconic portrayal of a ferocious woman in a men's world in this sword&sandal epic. She manipulates, leads, seduces, overpowers, humiliates, butchers men throughout the movie with memorable zeal -and with dry wit. In a key scene, which is emblematic in the sense it sums up her character, she seduces the rival Greek commander into sex, but when he wants to have her from the behind, she overpowers him and rises to the top to consummate the sex. Scenes without her (thankfully, very sparse) really seem like filler material to pad out the movie's duration. ps: the downside of the movie is that, even though it is very gory, all the gore is via very fake-looking cgi.

300: Rise of an Empire is a loyal continuation of the story told in the last film. It is not a departure from the story, but rather a wider view of what was going on before, during and after the Spartans met their glory.It is true to Frank Miller's vision and is a wonderful action film on it's own. The characters are likable and the story keeps you hooked. The 3D is actually well utilized and helps the scope of the large naval battles feel realistic and understandable. This is an absolute must see for anyone who enjoyed the first film or even if you are looking for a fresh take on slow motion, six pack abbed violence.

Now, I never intended to see this flick but I got free tickets so what's the harm, right? Well there is one...First of all - This film is as original as it gets. There is exactly zero parts of the film that are results of someones creative thinking. Well at least not of someone who worked on this movie...It is as boring as an action flick can get. You will experience about 8 motivational speeches to the troops. Which is about 7 more that I am willing to accept. There are exactly 7000 naked men running around in what appears to be the most unpleasant climate on earth. There is no interesting character - well maybe except Xerxes (who gets whopping 3 minutes of screen time and about 4 lines such as - "I am your king!"... The story line is so not speaking to me in terms of why would they choose this event to make film about(?!) And on top of it the incredible CG... Barrels and barrels of blood so fake you just can't get your eyes of it. What was it anyway? Raspberry pudding? Perhaps... It had one special feature to it though - you couldn't actually see it once it hit solid surface. All and all it's just incredibly annoying - never ending slow motion scenes, blue screen and dramatic speeches. Go and take a nice long walk instead. Trust me. Or kill yourself. Either way you'll have more fun.

'300: Rise of an Empre' isn't a sequel in the strictest sense of the word; rather, seeing as how King Leonidas and his small but mighty band of Spartans all but perished under the sheer numbers of the Persian army led by Xerxes in the three-day Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C., this 'side-sequel' stands astride the events of the original film by taking place within the same concurrent period of time. Not to worry though - for those who can't quite recall what happened the last time round, there is enough backstory to make up for the seven-year wait in between the two instalments.Taking the place of Leonidas is the Greek general Themistocles (Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton), who in the extended prologue is seen shooting an arrow straight into the heart of the invading Persian King Darius (Igal Naor) in battle. King Darius happens to be the father of Xerxes, but more significantly, he also had a surrogate daughter in the Greek-born Artemisia (Eva Green). The young Artemisia had been sold into slavery after the massacre of her parents by invading Greeks, and was rescued on the brink of death by none other than King Darius himself.Returning to script and produce but not to direct is Zack Synder, who together with his co-screenwriter Kurt Johnstad, lay out some relatively heavy exposition in the first half hour drawn again from a graphic novel by Frank Miller. Though one may get the impression from the name of that novel 'Xerxes' that the emphasis should be on the Persian god-king, the more intriguing character here - as well as that given significantly more screen time - is that of Artemisia. Indeed, it is Artemisia whose motivation for revenge inspires the same of the grief-stricken Xerxes, the latter of whom then undergoes a transformation from human to god- like complete with gold-dipped skin, multiple piercings and his unmistakable glistening chrome dome.Turns out that Xerxes' battle with King Leonidas was just one front of the Persian invasion of Greece; and since that story had already been told, this 'side-sequel' as we had described it earlier paints the other front in battle, one that takes place at sea between the two navies. Again, the Persians triumph in numbers, so the Greeks led by Themistocles employ some clever tactical manoeuvres to outwit the first two charges of the Persians, which Artemisia delegates to her generals to lead in order to observe - and test - the formidability of her opponent.Taking over the directorial reins is the commercials ace Noam Murro, who stages the naval battles with plenty of visual flair. Each major sequence is different enough from the rest to offer real variety, and impresses not just with its sheer display of military might but also its detailing of Greco-Persian battle strategy - the last we have seen such an exciting combination of both was in John Woo's 'Red Cliff: Part Two'. Nonetheless, those hoping for a reprise of the blood-soaked violence in '300' need not worry; there is still plenty of beheadings, skewerings, and sword slashes - though we might add that there is perhaps a gratuitous display of arterial sprayings which could really be toned down a little.Much less successful however is Murro's attempt to recreate the stylistics of Synder's original. Try though he might of aping its predecessor's mesmeric, affected visual presentation, Murro's film ultimately looks less elegant, the use of slo-mo in particular coming off obligatory and even pretentious. Whereas Synder preferred artistic compositions, Murro here prefers to leave war looking grittier and messier, which stand sometimes in contrast to the beautifully rendered digital backgrounds inserted once again by CGI wizards. Not surprisingly then, it isn't the man-on-man clashes that prove most spectacular this time round, but the swooping overhead shots of Greek ships going up against their clearly more daunting Persian armada.While substituting Artemisia for Xerxes proves inspired, the same cannot be said of Themistocles for Leonidas. Not only does Themistocles come off bland compared to the macho-man heroics of Leonidas, Stapleton takes the role just too seriously, lacking in the charisma and self-awareness that Gerard Butler brought to his character. You're more likely then to be transfixed by Green, who portrays Artemisia's malevolence with scene- chewing glee. She knows exactly how to deliver each line of the intentionally stilted dialogue, adding just the right touch of vampiness to make them campily entertaining; nonetheless, it is very likely that one will remember the centrepiece sex scene between Themistocles and Artemisia where both take turns to prove themselves the 'man' in the 'f**king'.If it isn't yet clear enough, Green is a big reason why this long- gestating sequel doesn't come off unnecessary. Like we said at the beginning, '300' isn't the most straightforward movie to stage a sequel; and even though this hardly matches the poetic storytelling of the original, there are still plenty of scenes of glorious bloodletting if that is your thing. We prefer though the visual spectacle that the impressively staged naval standoffs offer, and of course the spectacle that is Green's scene-stealing turn as a warrior queen. A word of caution too - don't expect a neat ending, for the open-ended conclusion suggests that the filmmakers think there is still lots of potential in the Greeks' eventual vanquishing of the Persians at Plataea and Mycale to continue the mythology of '300'.

The film "300" was a big hit when it hit the screens back in 2006. The film was directed by Zack Snyder, while Miller served as executive producer and consultant. In order to approximate the artwork of the graphic novel, the film used a special super-imposition chroma key technique. This anticipated sequel makes use of the same things that made the first film a hit to try to make this second film as big a success.Athenian general Themistocles shot an arrow in the battle of Marathon that angered the people of Persia. The Persian navy was led by a Greek woman named Artemisia, under the name of their man-god Emperor Xerxes. The two and their armadas clash in the Aegean Sea in multiple bloody and explosive battles for supremacy. One fights for pure love of country, while the other fights for sheer vengeance.Instead of the imposing Gerald Butler, we get a lesser actor, Sullivan Stapleton, as the central character Themistocles in this sequel. I thought he lacked charisma and conviction in his acting as the protagonist. There is that something lost or weak in his face that makes him less believable as the big hero. His lackluster screen presence and tentative performance almost ruined the film for me.Fortunately, I was very much impressed with the performance of the antagonist. Thanks to Eva Green, who delivers a sexy and bad-ass turn as Artemisia, I was not totally disappointed with the film. At first I thought it was only a big gimmick to have a female as the naval commander of Persia. However, as it turns out, Ms. Green would completely own this film. If not for her, I believe this film would tank big time. Rodrigo Santoro was again impressive as Persian King Xerxes, reprising his role from the first film. We see him evolve from a mere man to a man-god in an elaborate sequence of CG glory. Lena Headey also reprises her role as Queen Gorgo of Sparta. She was the one who tells this story, but will also get in on the military action later. David Wenham was the survivor Delios who narrated the first film, but in this sequel, his appearance was merely a cameo at best.The movie builds up on the first "300" film with a lot more Greeks (and their fabled abs) versus a lot more Persians. The first "300" was about the Battle of Thermopylae. This sequel is about the big naval Battle of Artemisia which happens at about the same time as the first battle, that is why there we can see this story weave in some events from the first film as well. The CG action here is a lot more cartoonishly gory, with blood splattering in all directions in generous amounts. This is like "300" all over again, but without the benefit of novelty, without the powerful presence of Gerald Butler, and without the directorial skills of Zack Snyder. This sequel by new director Noam Murro is certainly not better than the first film. So if you liked "300" as I did, you may still like this as well. If you didn't, then this film won't convert you. 7/10.

While 300 leads up to a tragic, heroic and inevitable climax, this successor does not. It is more a back-and-forth tug of war with some visually stunning scenes and, granted, several memorable acting performances.Whereas the inefficiency of the Persian army was explained in 300 by the narrow terrain and the elite status and war tactics of Leonidas and his 300 finest, there is no more respect whatsoever for Persian military skills in this movie. Laughingly it is even exclaimed that potters and artists can happily carve trough hordes of trained soldiers.Certain elements should be gravely disturbing for the educated viewer, such as the sudden appearance of an ironclad, 2340 years before its actual conception. Another example is that a horse with rider is really not able to jump out of the water on to a slippery trireme and otherwise prance around from one rolling deck to another. It distracts from the naval tactics and weather conditions that won the Greeks the battle in history.In all it is an entertaining film in the same (now less) original style of 300. It however fails to produce a similar lasting impression.

I can't understand why Zack Snyder didn't direct this sequel, and how someone who has never directed an action sequence before and just one feature film can be entrusted with a production of this magnitude. That would already be a recipe for disaster, even though in reality Snyder was supervising.In an attempt to live up to it's predecessor, 300: Rise of An Empire is action-packed, presents impressive visuals and is very bloody. In fact there is more action, more blood, and more nudity than in the original 300. As for the plot, there really isn't much to chew on. A naval commander, Themistocles is supposedly trying to reunite Greece. Since the story takes place before, during and after King Leonidas leads his men to fight the Persians, it can be hard to follow at times. Most of the acting was mediocre and couldn't quite compensate for the weaknesses in the story. The Australian actor cast as Themistocles in my opinion was a very bad choice, and comes nowhere close to what Gerard Butler did as King Leonidas in 300. He just doesn't bring that rugged heroic presence on screen as is expected. Interestingly I read somewhere that director Noam Murro insisted it would be Sullivan Stapleton who played this character, claiming he was 'the one'. Eva Green on the other hand is plays an excellent villain as Artemisia.

Gloriously employing Zack Snyder's style of slow-fast continuous shots, as well as taking the scale and dynamics to the next level, this is a worthy sequel to the awesome 300. It has pretty much the same weaknesses and strengths of its predecessor, but improves on what made the first film a success.A pretty obvious notion is that no other film does better with the long continuous shots of action with the occasional slow motions. This is a wonderful style to marvel on, for those who like these kind of things (I do!). This is the main reason I came to watch this, yet it is not the only thing that impressed me. But before moving on, I want to further claim that I seriously enjoyed these style of shots and frankly, all...ALL of the action sequences. They are just marvellous and glorious to watch and from minute one, I was attached and just smiling on every fight sequence.Still on the matter of action sequences, they are better in visual quality & dynamics of the setting, although I suspect the reason may be the budget and resource constraint on the first film. If Snyder had this the last time, it would be as good as this. Fortunately, Rise of an Empire, even in the hands of new director Noam Murro, didn't mess it up and brilliantly improves upon it. And though the quality of visuals were not perfect (such as the blood effects), the style is just so gratifying to watch. One last thing, the soundtrack is genuinely amazing, and is unbelievably fitting for the scenes. Even before the action begins, my heart pumps up, and during the fight itself, the soundtrack did good to enhance the suspense of the action. Words are not enough to explain it...you have to listen to it first hand.Actions aside, the plot was overall a straightforward one, except for those which relates to the original 300, which I was quite impressed of. Despite the lack of drama & humour, and the limited emotional range of the characters, some of the characters were great. I was initially skeptical of the main character, and though he may not have outdone Gerard Butler's Leonidas, Themistokles is still quite the likable action hero. And while I had a great feeling about the villain, Eva Green's Artemisia really stole the show on every scene she was in. As further praise, if the producers do intend to make another sequel, they will need one hell of villain to top off Artemisia.Overall, this is a very very entertaining movie, if what you're looking for is fun, action, and visuals. They did extremely well in these aspects, and make it such a wonderful film for a great time in the movies.VERDICT:Good: Excellent style, Improved visuals, Highly entertaining fight sequences, Brilliant soundtrack, Amazing charactersBad: Lack of drama & humour, Less compelling plotSCORE: 7.0(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)

"Greece" is under attack of Xerxes of Persia (ca. 480 BC). While Leonidas of Sparta is fighting in Battle of Thermopylae ("300"), Themistokles of Athens is preparing a sea battle at Salamis (this movie). Don't expect deep historic drama, wrong genre. This is graphic-novel art splendor and a strong sequel of 300. I was highly entertained and completely drawn into this world with amazing graphic art scenery and a high Asian Martial Art feel fight scenes. 3D is working during the sea battles but not really required. The introduction of Artemisia, Themistokles and Xerxes becoming the GodKing of Persia were cool but might be a bit confusing as it wasn't always obvious that these were flashbacks in the current story.Sullivan Stapleton as Themistokles did well, not Gerard Butler though. Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo was again a graceful power lady, GoTh made her even stronger in character. Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes is again hot, especially as his younger self. Eva Green as Navy Admiral Artemisia was one mean, bad lady, strong like in Kingdom of Heaven and occasionally I was more on her side than on the Greek's ... and her costumes are just ... fantastic!If I could rate half points, it would rate it 8,5 because 300 was in my opinion stronger, funnier and more dramatic but 9 rates are for films that I will see again ... and I will see this one again, mainly due to Artemisia, she was awesome.Ps If you don't like bloody scenes, it might be not your type of film

The movie is definitely not more of the same things from its predecessor, which of-course gives the movie an identity for itself, rather than being in the shadow of 300 (2006).The story is said from the perspective of Artemisia(Eva Green) more, and less as from Themistokles(Sullivan Stapleton), and therefore one might find themselves cheering for the Persians this time. Artemisia, the Persian naval commander is one refined character and Eva Green sure managed to capture that vengeance seeking and unstoppable traits of the character. Same cannot be said about Themistokles, played by Sullivan Stapleton, though. The character managed only to stay soft throughout the movie, and therefore never managed to show the valor as Leonidas from the 2006 movie, played by Gerard Butler.The movie delivers some short side stories, which creates some depth to the story, unlike the predecessor. But the look and feel of the movie has compromised a lot and looks way mediocre, which is why I just rated it 6 stars.

I call this a Dark Movie, because only 10 minutes you will find a light on this movie. The battlefield is in a darkness. On 3D if you watch you must keep your eyes so open to see a battle.The 'sex fight' scene don't like it, because you have so important negotiations for your country and get horny?! What's the point?This movie however has a good side. First time to see how Sparta and Greece are together and fight against they enemy. The actors are good in this movie, Sullivan Stapleton was brilliant, but I miss still Gerard Butler. Just like in the first part, best thing are 'slow scene'The third part will be full of surprises.

The movie opened with the land battle of Marathon, then continued on with the naval battles of Artemisium and Salamis. It is an impressive list of battles,but the execution could have been better. The movie's story line flowed beautifully right up until the battle of Artemisium. After that, the producers felt that they are running out of time/money, so they decided to rush everything to a less than a spectacular end.The battle of Salamis was the most important battle of the entire war. They should have skipped the battle of Marathon, moved on to show Artemisium right in the beginning, focus more on the destruction of Athens and give the battle of Salamis the spectacular ending it deserved rather than rush it.Other than the above, the movie featured lots of gore, blood, limbs falling off everywhere. Greek supermen hacking and slicing everything they lay their swords in. Artemisia, the Persian commander played by Eva Green was a very pleasant sight, especially the boobs, men would kill for those boobs. Naval battles are the main focus of this film, ships ramming one into another on an epic scale. This movie is just for fun. Don't expect historical accuracy. As for the battle of Salamis, historically, the Athenian navy faced the Persians with 250 warships....

So the Movie starts off with a pretty OK fighting scene.Take care of this moment because this is probably the only scene that will live up to your expectations.I will not over analyze the Movie because its just not Worth the effort.The Movie was plain simple boring. Every scene was just taking your expectations away bit for bit and makes you realise the inevitable truth that this Movie will take Place on the goddamn ships the whole time. Except of course when they are have shitty romantic speeches about freedom and how awesome it is to be lame. The true heart of the first 300 was the brilliant fighting scenes and the simple principle: - You want to change how we live? - Oh yeah? F you and everyone that looks like you, you shitheads! We rather F our mothers than surrender.The sequel is the complete opposite: - Ooh, look at us. We have to have this bullshit democracy and F up Everything because we have our freedoms. Lets be lame and use Home-Alone-Traps for defense instead of real fighting scenes pumped up with some Persian-hating testosterone.I Went to the Cinema this evening expecting a sure to be awesome Movie and all I got was this bullshit.Im gonna spend my remaining Days praying that all the involved people in this Movie will spend the rest of their lives flipping Burgers at Burger King.

I have just seen this movie and I think it was OK. It is basically 300 with ships instead of Spartans. The script isn't complicated, the acting is good (very good when it comes to Eva Green) and the action (almost) never stops. As expected, the best thing about the movie are the special effects. I don't like 3D at all, but this time I didn't find it annoying. The one thing I did find annoying was the fact that there was way too much fake blood (Spartacus style). However, there are some things this movie lacks, compared to its predecessor.First of all, there isn't a charismatic, godlike, main character. Sullivan Stapleton is OK, but nowhere near Gerard Butler (and I don't mean his acting, but his overall screen presence). Like I said before, Eva Green is great and I'm glad the writers focused quite a lot on the villain (she even has a Hollywoodish background story). Secondly, I thing Rise of an Empire doesn't have its own "personality" at all. It "burrows" way too many things from 300. I know it is a sequel to a movie that had a lot of style and a huge "cool factor", but maybe they should have have tried to add some other things (at least some other cool quotes). Or maybe I just want too much.Overall, compared to other big budget movies that I've seen recently, Rise of an Empire was good. If you want a nice feel-good movie for the week-end than this should be your choice.A decent 7/10...

I think almost everyone can agree that a sequel to 300 is completely unnecessary. However, deeming something unnecessary doesn't certainly make it bad. In an ideal world, one may even argue that a sequel to 300 might be a very good movie: considering how the original had its fair share of flaws, the sequel could easily eliminate these flaws, while still focusing on what made the original enjoyable. The only problem with that argument is that we don't live in a ideal world (actually, we live in a world where a big chunk of sequels are made exclusively for profit, not for improvement of the first installment) and that 300: Rise of an Empire is just a horrible movie, which everyone should skip.Calling 300: Rise of an Empire a sequel to 300 could be a misinterpretation. Rise of an Empire's plot timeline occurs before, during and after the original movie's timeline. The movie is narrated by King Leonidas' wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), who tells the story of an Athenian hero called Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton). Themistokles killed Xerxes' father Darius (Igal Naor) during the Battle of Marathon. Ten years after that event Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) decided to revenge his father and destroy all of Greece. This time Themistokles must stop the giant Persian navy lead by Xerxes' second in command, the menacing Artemisia (Eva Green). Even after just glancing at the movie's synopsis, it's very obvious that 300: Rise of an Empire's title doesn't make much sense. There are much more than 300 warriors in the movie (none of them Spartan) fighting the Persian hordes, and no empire is rising during the movie. There are some talks about uniting the Greek city-states, but that's about it.I know Rise of an Empire wanted to be connected to the original movie in some way, but throwing a bunch of out of place references definitely isn't the best possible way of obtaining that. Even the Persian emissary, who was famously kicked in the bottomless pit in the original, makes a cameo appearance. But in Rise of an Empire not only does he have nothing against women speaking in front of men, but he even plays an important role in Artemisia's military career. And speaking of continuity errors – Queen Gorgo's narration doesn't make much sense since the movie portrays some situations in which she clearly didn't participate; and not only that, but there were also some flashbacks in the movie, which weren't her own! Continuity errors and plot holes similar to these two (there are much more) quickly destroy any suspension of disbelief and ultimately ruin the movie-going experience. I'm thoroughly aware that some people could label this plot hole criticism as simple nitpicking, but Rise of an Empire also fails in many other aspects, not only in delivering a coherent plot.Rise of an Empire has all the flaws the original one had, without any of its charm or virtues. The characters in Rise of an Empire are even less developed than they were in the original (believe it or not!) and the slow motion is as abused as ever. The man who replaced Zack Snyder in the director' chair, Noam Murro (who only directed one movie before this), struggles between ripping off Snyder's visual style and finding his own voice. The ultimate result of this painful struggle is a bland, boring and uninspiring movie, which does almost nothing spectacular. Some action sequences (especially the ones of naval battles) looked decent but everything fell apart when the fake CGI blood (which looked like something created in Microsoft paint) started spraying around. The two leads, Sullivan Stapleton and Eva Green, do their best to save this movie, but even their combined forces aren't enough to make Rise of an Empire a watchable movie. In the end, it's not the lack of coherent plot that made me hate Rise of an Empire, nor the awful special effects, nor the non-existent character development; what made me hate it is the possibility of another sequel.Rating: 3/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/

Well,first after i came to know before this film related that jack Snyder is not gonna direct this sequel and a new director is director is handling it,i was disappointed,I'm a huge fan of Snyder's slow-mo fight sequences and i was worried that i may miss them in the sequel.however,this sequel is really well handled,fans of original will not be disappointed coz there is even more blood and violence in the film,and a few adult gags too.....And the theme too changed,it was red in the original matching with the dress code,and now its blue,and it is beautiful to eyes.Coming to artistic performances the real show stealer is Eva green,she is damn hot,there is nothing much to do for the other actors,thermostokle character is not played well when compared to Leonidas by Gerald Butler in original,now other departments-background score is cool,Cgi is really good writing is improved however there are some words which not at all suits the historical films,and lines like-you fight harder than you f**k....come on is these lines necessary?you cannot find such words in original3D-there is great depth in 3d,if Ur expecting dock in you seats kind O 3d effects,then there are nothing,still 3d is well used and added beauty for the cgi heavy film,you can see blood spilling in the middle of theater and i was really amazed by the depth,Final verdict:a watch worthy sequel that wont let you down,keep your expectations low and...SEIZE YOU GLORY........

While Zac Snyder's 2007 blood soaked, sun drenched, slomo ab fest 300 is in no way a narrative masterpiece there is little doubt about it's pure visceral entertainment value a fact highlighted by its huge box office booty and a legion of fans that to this day remember the splattering of Persian and Spartan blood fondly as when it first hit their senses like a swaying of a sharpened sword. With the subsequent release of this prequel/sequel many of these rabid fans were hoping for more of the same and while 300: Rise of an Empire does indeed provide much of the same in the stakes of blood, slomo abs and as much wheat grass 3-D effects as you can shake a loincloth at it just holds none of the abstract charm or wow factor that made it's much grander predecessor such a joy.The movie itself should be entitled 300: On a Boat with much of the action forfeiting the comfort of solid ground in favour of a procession of navy battles that really start to blur into one another and become nothing more than a bunch of battles that feel all to similar. The move to have the action take place on the high seas was clearly done to try and make the film seem more grand than it actually is and try to separate itself from what has come before but in saying this the film seems to take every opportunity to pay homage or remind us of what went on in 300 and all that does is remind the audience that they probably should of stayed home and watched the original instead. These naval battles do however have moments of visual beauty and individual scenes that give off the sense at some stage the film was on the right track but is consistently derailed thanks to a narrative that at no stage engages as 300 did in 2007. In his first Hollywood leading role Australian Sullivan Stapleton is given a sword, a cape and many grandstanding battle speeches but unfortunately he doesn't even come close to filling Gerard Butler's sandals. His role as the heroic Themistokles is so bland you almost wish the film was a silent movie with no dialogue resonating or getting that pre battle blood flowing in a way which improved vastly our time spent with Leonidas. Other actors are all merely sword and spear fodder with Eva Greens seriously tormented and twisted Artemisia making the biggest impression but to say her performance is anything more than a bit of fun would be a lie. It is a shame that relatively new director Noam Murro couldn't get more out of the human aspect as said before he does at times display a quality hand with certain visuals and moments of battle that make the film better than it perhaps even is. While 300 will continue to entertain and remain a very quality piece of throwaway visual entertainment Rise of an Empire will likely sink like a wrecked ship of war in a sea of other average follow ups. Possessing some nice visuals and spraying some pretty looking blood effects does not a good film make but we can be thankful of it reminding us that the original is a better film than many give it credit for. 2 boat horses out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com

300: Rise of an Empire was a little different from what I initially expected. Assumed it was a sequel. However, it is more of a companion movie - a different view point of the events in 300 and the events after and some events before.I found the story to be entertaining. The Persians are still attacking Greece, but this time we watch from the view point of Athenian Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) while the events of 300 unfold elsewhere. The backstory of some old and some new characters were interesting to watch. The events which take place after 300 were awesome and led to some great battle scenes.And whilst 300 had plenty of fantastic battle scenes, Rise has some equally fantastic naval battle scenes. Ships wrecks, beheadings, one on ones, and battles were all awesome and entertaining. Watching Themistocles engage in naval tactics was quite fun to watch. The one on one (or multiple) combats were a bit better than the original. I found them rougher and just more fun to watch. Eva green as Artemisia was amazing. She was terrifying at times and great fun to watch. However, I did find a few scenes felt out of place and unnecessary. In saying that, the confrontations Themistocles and Artemisia more than made up for it. The ending of the movie was satisfying and to repeat myself, so was the final battle scenes. They were incredibly fun to watch. A very entertaining movie, especially since I was lucky to be able to watch them back to back on the big screen.

The long awaited follow up to 2007's hit 300 is exciting, very entertaining. There is a new director (the little known Noam Murro from Israel), but the recharged, operatic style, with heavy use of digital imagery, that made the first movie famous is back again. It can be said that this is not technically a sequel, as both movies happen more or less simultaneous chronologically: the first movie took place in the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC). The new one, after an introduction in the Battle of Marathon (490 BC), centers on the Battle of Salamis, in 480 BC, around the same time as Thermopylae. (Of course, I know you don't go to movies like this to learn about history).Sorting out from their defeat at Marathon, the new Persian emperor Xerxes decides to take revenge in the form of a large seaborne invasion of Greece. His main admiral is the incredibly sexy but brutal Artemisia, who is Greek born but was saved when she was a little girl by a Persian and has lived in the Persian court ever since, thirsting for revenge against her native land. The Greek side, on the other hand is commanded by the brave, honest Athenian Themistocles.As Themistocles, Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton is fine, though he lacks somewhat the charisma Gerard Butler showed playing Leonidas in the first film. But Eva Green as Artemisia is magnificent, magnetic, by far the most charismatic character of the film. Rodrigo Santoro is back as (a very fantastic) Xerxes. Lena Heady reappears briefly as Gorgo, Queen of Sparta. There are very fine action scenes involving naval battles, but the movie's best scene has Artemisia bringing Themistocles to her boat to ostensibly discuss peace, but it all ends up in a heated sexual rump.

I had considerably muted my expectations when I went out to see this movie last night. I mean, no bad ass Spartans and Leonidas right? So this bloke who plays Themistokles (Sullivan) has about as much charisma as a 90 year old geriatric butler on the outback. That sort of spoiled the movie for me. The continuity aspect was well taken care off. Again, I would not dwell on inconsistencies in historical narrative since this is based off a graphic novel.Eva Green was good in her role. There was very little of Xerxes, which was another sore point. The good bit was amazing 3D effects. Went very well. I liked the whole setting.

A follow-up to the 2007 film 300, '300: Rise of an Empire' is Hardcore, No-Holds-Barred Entertainment! An Epic Action-Packed/Gruesome Venture, that offers a punch! '300: Rise of an Empire' Synopsis: Greek general Themistokles leads the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia, vengeful commander of the Persian navy.'300: Rise of an Empire', in terms of story, is clichéd. Its the Good versus the Evil. Its been-there-seen-that stuff. But, what makes this biggie reach the winning post, are its absolutely Stunning Visual Effects & the astounding Action-Sequences. The Visual Effects are just out of this world, while the Action-Sequences, though gruesome & repulsive at times, are epically constructed & executed. The Climatic Fight, especially, is WOW! Zack Snyder & Kurt Johnstad's Screenplay offers no novelty, but is crisp & arresting, at most parts. Noam Murro's Direction is top-notch. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is sharp. Make-Up is well-done. Performance-Wise: Sullivan Stapleton as Themistocles & Eva Green as Artemisia stand out. Sullivan is as heroic as it can get, while Eva is deliciously despicable, giving us a nemesis that's sexy & frightening at the same time. Others lend able support. On the whole, If you have the stomach for it, try not to miss '300: Rise of an Empire'.

Legendary's blood soaked, fantasy fetish fueled, graphic novel style retelling of the second Persian invasion of Greece returns. While the brave 300 Spartans faced down Xerxes legions at Thermopylae, a second and no less pivotal conflict was taking place. A massive naval campaign led by the vengeful, and no less crazy, Artemesia advances on Greek shores. Only a handful of Athenian ships, and the unconventional strategies of general Themistocles, stands in their way.Expanding on the story started in Zack Snyder's 300, 300 Rise of an Empire brings green screen slow motion carnage into the naval arena. Familiar themes are tackled here: of children losing their childhood in the heat of battle, of how one man's devotion to freedom and democracy helped rally a legion, and of how a small force can overcome any odds. Zack Snyder's screenplay peppers the script with a good dose of testosterone, manly howls of inspiration, and dash of innuendo, especially between rival generals Artemesia and Themistocles. Eva Green steals the show as the manipulative and sadistic Artemesia. Magnificent screen presence, deadly like a coiled viper yet sizzling hot against the cold blue ocean backdrop. Easily one of the more memorable and charismatic comic book villains since Dark Knight's Joker. Without conscience and fueled by burning passion, she is the perfect foil to Themistocles' stereotypical superhero image. Themistocles is a little like marvel's Captain America. He stands for justice, freedom and democracy. He had forsaken family and love for servitude to his country. His image of calm courage and steadfast control threatening to crumble under the weight of leadership; where every wrong move kills off someone's husband, father, or son. Their on screen chemistry is almost perfect despite being in actual physical proximity for 2 scenes. Some say that backstory kills off mystique; nobody wanted to know that Michael Meyers had a screwed up childhood before he became the masked Halloween killer. Love it or hate it, 300 Rise of an Empire delves into the tragic backstory of its villains. Xerxes' tale especially lends itself to the running theme of a son taking up his fallen father's mantle and surpassing his parent. Did we really need to know how a depressed prince became the God King of Persia? Why not? Our past shapes our future, as do our mistakes. Through Xerxes' invasion, Themistocles learns the hard way that mistakes of the past will bite you back one day. And bite hard.It is a pity that Zack Snyder merely penned the screenplay. His presence as a director is sorely missed. Director Noam Murro does his best to follow in the stylish speed tweaked vision of Snyder's. It is a good effort, but not as dynamic as his predecessor. Instead of the golden bronze and striking crimson, we have a dull blue and murky grey color palate. Where Snyder infused his battle scenes with a gruesome grace and flow, Murro's battles are messy, hectic and hastily edited. Slow motion ramping (alternating sped up and slowed down shots) originally used to zoom in on and emphasize iconic shots, are just slapped on seemingly at random.Despite the disappointing directing, this movie is a real joy to watch. The naval clashes evoke memories of historical classics like Ben Hur; wide in scope and epic in scale. It's cast chemistry and charisma provides the pivotal centerpiece in what could have been a forgettable and unnecessary sequel. This ain't Sparta. But this sure is almost as glorious.

No Story Line....Several plots Woven haphazardly....Monotonous....Sullivan(AKA Themistocles) Failed to impress...he don't have that voice command like Bulter(Leonidas) had......King Xerxes(Rodrigo Santoro) looked better before going bald... The movie is based on the simple Fact.....Don't Unleash A lady's wrath...no new thingy....Eva as Artemisia....was Simply a misfit....She did some gud actions...other than that she failed to portray that manipulative nature of Artemisia....The directors Should have Focused on Queen Gorgo(Lena)...Which they did in last 10 minutes.....Making it sure that there is a sequel waiting Focused on Queen Gorgo....So I have some hope that its Sequel will be Good...coz Lena did full justice to the part she was givn....

Rise of an Empire shows the Battle of Artemisium where Athens general Themistocles(Sullivan Stapleton) fights with Persian naval commander Artemisia(Eva Green). On the parallel side to this, the Battle of Thermoplyae happens between King Leonidas of Sparta and King Xerxes of Persia which we've seen in the earlier part 300. Rise of an Empire also shows Xerxes past and the events after 300 in parallel with the naval war. All the graphic violence in the earlier part appears in this one too. Perhaps thats the reason why we flock to theaters. But this installment lacks the 'Act of Valor' of Leonidas and his troops that made 300 a smashing hit. The cult fan base of 300 will be satisfied enough and the people who like graphic violence can give this a shot but for others its just a good looking video game.Sullivan Stapleton was OK but the film lacks Gerard Butler's presence. Eva Green stole the show as Persian naval commander and she was the highlight of the film. Lena Headey didn't had enough screen time but she did a good job.Noam Murro honestly imitated the style of first film but Zack Synder would've done a better job. Murro delivered a stylish one but the script didn't allowed him to elevate the film even then it was a mediocre attempt.Cinematography was good but most of the shots had lens flare which distracts our eyes but its the CGI that stands tall out of the whole film. Original Score was good at times but mostly we hear the loud noise. Editing was crisp. Just when i thought all this was UN-necessary, they've given a cliffhanger at the ending. May be a 'Return of the King' vibe for a third part? We have to wait for that. For now fans will eventually see this one because ain't bad but ain't that good either for others to run to theaters.

Whilst fearing that the Oracle's dark prophecy will come to fruition, Greece is divided on what to do about the invasion. Athenian general Themistocles(Stapleton, more concerned with his men's lives than Butler's Leonidas, sadly also lacking the infectious quality to his enthusiasm for the fight and the infinitely quotable roared lines) takes matters into his own hands, choosing to face the enormous Persian fleet with his, minuscule in comparison, but also faster and more maneuverable. He also brings expert tactics - then again, so does his countryman Artemisia(Green, deliciously bloodthirsty and insane, stealing the movie entirely), who fights for the other side, to avenge a horrible wrong done to her decades ago(and their dynamic aids the otherwise blander characters(even the returning ones don't need to be here), messy stalling plot and insipid writing). Who will emerge victorious?Taking place before, during and some after, this is a... sequel...? to 300, that goes with "bigger is better", and largely fares well. One location? How about three. A single historically accurate tactic? Let's go with half a dozen. Hundreds against a million? Dozens against... thousands... OK, so not everything fits that. This suffers under trying to connect to and imitate its predecessor - when this has no specific values defended or cemented in spite of namedropping freedom, does not add to the overall story, and, let's be honest, partially on account of aforementioned, has no reason to exist(which is not to say you won't have a blast... while the 3D is negligible, this is something to watch in theaters). It does gain from not slavishly adapting a comic(by Frank Miller, no less, whose work very much uses that medium's strengths), opening it up to being conventional, and more exciting and gritty(yes, it's a current action film, so of course it is... at the same time, that does lead to battle scenes enjoying a more visceral effect).There is constant bloody disturbing violent content, some nudity and a little(if certainly vicious... no, you read that right) sexuality in this. I recommend this to anyone who can get into mindless, ego-stroking(...why are the Spartans still the ones made to be the biggest badasses?) male power fantasy nonsense. 7/10

I never liked Goth girls until I watched "300: Rise of an Empire," Eva Green broke my heart once in Casino Royale, but boy Artemisia revived every living bit of it. It is a great movie, some war scenes are reminiscent of the game-play in Assassin's Creed, Metal Gear & Modern warfare. The Gothic atmosphere, the sad narrative of the widowed Queen, the sadist romance for war, and the cunning strategy of heroes... boy I was on the edge of my seat throughout.An awesome war movie, in every sense of the word. Do yourself a favor, and watch it!

There's an early scene in 300 (released exactly eight years ago this Sunday) where Leonidas shows Daxos, an allied Arcadian, just what his men excel in (combat). He comically wraps this up with a single line: "I brought more soldiers than you did." It's easier to feel the quote in a stronger light with the release of 300: Rise of an Empire; this sequel/prequel mesh has less length, viciousness and entertainment than its easily re-watchable predecessor. Taking focus away from Sparta, Rise of an Empire casts Sullivan Stapleton as Athenian Themistocles. His tale begins before the events of 300, but quickly catches up to when Leonidas and his Spartans ultimately fell. Along with Themistocles' backstory, a certain antagonist is treated to some extra details. Meanwhile, Eva Green comes to play her part as the truly twisted Artemisia, clearly intended as a scene-stealer. The first place to start with Rise of an Empire is its lead. Themistocles himself is a fair enough character, showing more of an everyday vibe than Leonidas. However, Stapleton isn't up to provide a compelling performance. There's simply no sense of command or outright authority. A bit more can be afforded to Eva Green, clearly delighting in a sense of smug power. What most people will care about, however, is the action. Thanks to its over-the-top style and unabashed battle sequences, 300 set a new expectation for what audiences could call a fun, blood-ridden time. Conversely, Rise of an Empire feels more like a trail of stained footprints leading to a half-eaten corpse. Most of the film's spectacle comes from the heavily shaded CGI and filters, making much of the action feel like it was taken right out of pre- rendered video game cutscenes. When blade meets skin, blood comes and goes with the viewer's interest. It probably says a lot when the best part of the movie is an over-the-top sex scene. Throughout the entire runtime, Rise of an Empire feels like it's going to provide something bigger, something grander. By the time this moment finally begins pouring out, we're greeted with the end credits. Much like the attempts at creating great and memorable action scenes, payoff was clearly of little concern to the director and screenwriters. Style stomps over substance here, as does placidity to style.www.theretailjudge.com

I watched yesterday premiere in 3d and really i enjoyed,Eva green she was amazing and also the Image of Themistocles it was incredible good job the soundtrack in every battle makes you wanted to be a part in the battles is for sure one movie with a lot o violence looks like a comics and is almost the same quality as the first one.The story is not exactly the original one but the main source is the same the Athenians ships were correct and the Persians also, the strategy of Themistocles was correct the chemistry between the places of Greece almost correct and is good to watch one country that they fight each other in the difficult situation like the possibility to loose their freedom from Persian army how the united as one and fight against the Tyranny.Eva green she was amazing actress all the movements that see take and how see gain the respect from the Persian kings ,and off course the battles at sea i believe they were the best sea battles that we seen in cinemas now days and with the combination of cgi images, background and also the atmospheric soundtrack makes a spectacular results and good movie

OK. When we deal with a potential sequel to an astounding original we as the audience expect it to much brilliant than the original. Sadly, this sequel falls way short of the expectations.Anyway, its what i thought when I saw the movie today. It had all the elements of a gore fest,nudity and blood. Body parts fall everywhere with a neatly done fight choreography ( whoever did the fight scenes should be applauded. Honestly it was neat ). Fast moves and flying body parts made it look like it was made just for the action scenes. There was no drama in it like its predecessor. 300 was more romantic in everything but Rise of an Empire is just hell bent on Vengeance.Rodrigo Santoro has nothing to do in the film like in the original except make a commanding appearance. He is nothing compared to Eva Green. She is the only one who stands out. Sullivan Stapelton does his best to be a warrior. Lena Headey narrates the whole film as does David Wenham in the original. if there should be a sequel I strongly suggest Xerxes fight. The sound was awesome. Graphics eye catching. Fight scenes brilliant.Finally, its suitable for those who thirst for blood and glory and not for the weak hearted.My Favourite line in the movies "YOU FIGHT HARDER THAN YOU ****.

Look it had great visuals and fighting was good but really I feel we all bought into the Spartan story line from 300 (2006); I loved the people of Sparta and how they were built up to be the best warriors and how a mere 300 of them put up and excellent fight... so when they died and we saw a clip of the entire Spartan fleet taking revenge, that is what I wanted to see, that is what I feel was the hype leading up to this movie... not another movie building up for the exact same clip... I wanted to see Sparta unleash their full power on the Persian army, I don't care about Athens, and why should we be forced to care about them when we fell in love with Sparta from the first movie; that is what I paid all that money to see... not another build up to it.The main character in this one had a bad accent and he did not have the presence of the Leonidas, he was placed as the Commander of the entire Greek fleet (which was disappointingly small)yet he seemed insignificant, his speeches had no impact either; no "TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL!" feels... Also just because there is a male main character and a female main character, doesn't mean they have to have sex for the sake of a sex scene in the movie... What I didn't understand, besides that the Spartan army is bigger than the rest of the Greece's combined, was that the "army" in this movie was made up of farmers and traders, yet they were all ripped as stuff and fought like assassins and out classed the Persian fighters, I got that they won with the handy tricks, but besides that how were they so good in hand to hand combat?With regards to Artemisia, she exceeded my expectations from a female main villain, normally they over do their evilness in an over dramatized way, but she did it well. Still I cared not for her defeat, only Xerxes.Anyways, I am really disappointed as I thought I was paying money to see the movie after this one.... I really wanted to see Sparta tear stuff up and send fear into Persian hearts with their war chants.

I'll be honest here. I wasn't a big fan of 300. The script was pretty basic but what worked was the production values, the action, casting and .. the dialogues. That it what made it the moderate entertainer that it was.Now comes the sorry sequel. Here you'll find a short list of things that make this movie un-watchable --The story- Its like 300 all over again, minus the intensity and masculinity. Its terrible. There is no innovation , clearly the writer and director were short of any inspiration that could make the story adequately satisfying on any level. There was a kind of side story involving a father and son which was probably the worst part of this distasteful movie. By the end , i didn't care what happened to anybody as long as it happened quickly .0/10The dialogues- So amateur, so freaking juvenile. Probably due to absence of script, the actors (oh the wretched actors!, will come to that later) were made to improvise and blurt whatever seems to be right-ish.Example-Warrior: There will be death and destruction!Themistocles: Yes... (long pause) Themistocles: There will be.And not to forget ,SEIZE THE GLORY!!. 0/10The casting- The actors ,all of them, even Queen Cercei, were just going through the motions. The lead guy was seriously miscast. He tried to pull a Butler, but failed...epically. Eva Green tried to do what she could with what she had, but she never had enough. Her scenes became monotonous after a while. The side actors could easily have been crew members who were given roles just to get on with this crap-fest. The only strong character , i.e Xerxes was given about 6 minutes of screen time. Its almost as if Zack 'The Hack' Snyder wanted this movie to fail, and fail it did. 2/10 (only for Rodrigo Santoro)The production- Now this is what made the original...well mediocre. I honestly believed that the movie will stand out in this department. Now heres what i observed. Although made on a budget of 100 million, the effects were god-darn terrible. At times it felt like i was watching a TV show. Spartacus has 20 times better production value than this mess of a movie. The battle scenes felt like the opposite of epic. Has this director ever shot any action scene before, let alone a battle! I think not. I've seen better choreographed fights in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and i believed that about sums it up. 00/10The direction- Probably a first timer, a clueless director just trying to follow a blind man's footsteps. I am not saying that a good director might have been able to pull it off, but this guy just added insult to injury. 0/10.The climax - Don't care. Just Frickin end it and i'll be off. 0/10And the absolute worst part-- There's gonna be another one. When people will forget how bad this was , Mr Snyder will lay another crap on us. YAY!!Don't watch it. Please. Or if you're so darn inclined to punish yourself, i'd suggest you go easy on yourself and just watch 2 back to back recent Adam Sandler Movies.

To understand this film "Greece" is under attack of Xerxes of Persia (ca. 480 BC). While Leonidas of Sparta is fighting in Battle of Thermopylae ("300"), Themistokles of Athens (Sullivan Stapleton) is preparing a sea battle at Salamis (this movie). Basically the first act of the film is a prequel in a way explaining Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) past & the second act is the sequel as Themistokles played by Sullivan Stapleton takes on the sea battle with Eva Greens character Artemisia. Don't expect deep historic drama here as this is not a history film that some people seem to mistake this film for, history is the wrong genre this film is. This is a graphic-novel art splendor and a strong sequel of 300. Highly entertained with amazing graphic art scenery and a high Asian Martial Art feel fight scenes, this is what Hollywood should take note at on how to make a sequel because this was nothing short of perfect with more blood scene than the first film. From the start this film throw you straight in to the action with bloody scene as well as the back story of Xerxes which is brilliant done as it plays as a prequel/sequel type of film which is cleverly done.Sullivan Stapleton as Themistokles did very well as the hero of the film, he wasn't like Gerard butlers role with Leonidas but very close with a different battle style of fighting which was brilliant on screen.Lena Headey reprise her role as Queen Gorgo was once again shown as a graceful power lady with vengeance i her heart she really show's this well on screen for a believe character,special with the fighting scenes (really live's up to the quote Leonidas said in the first film to xerxes "clear you don't know spartan woman we should of sent them out here, they are more of a warrior then the men you sent out today").Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes becoming the God King of Persia was brilliant done to give him more character & showing just how he became the god king which was amazing.Eva Green as Admiral Artemisia now this role was perfect for her acting, this is why Eva Green is a fantastic actress & has a on screen presences of that woe factor, the way is plays this role, strong like in Kingdom of Heaven she did, but with a cold ruthless nasty almost demonic nature like she would scarfice anyone to get victory she plays this role with flawless ease, its why i rate her one of the top 10 actress's around. 300: Rise of an empire lives up to the hype, its a must to watch, never have a seen a better squeal to a film than this one, normal when you get a sequel they end up poorly done or badly written but this film should stand in Hollywood on how to make a fantastic sequel, brilliant acting, brilliant fight scene, bloodier than the first film with a back story.Just an outstanding film. Dislikes : My only complaint about this film is the certification this film got in the cinema, the violence level, rape scene's & strong sexual scene, extreme bloody content of this film is Very R-Rated & should of been an 18 cert.

I went to see it, and did not know what to expect. I enjoyed the first one but was not a die hard fan of the movie. This one, however, was even better and now has me HOOKED!Definitely see this movie, and I disagree with the low meta score or whatever that is, that it has received. I made an account on IMDb and this is the first movie I have ever reviewed, just because I enjoyed it so much.So if you liked the 300 movie.. see this one. You will like it even more!10/10

Director Noam Murro thinks that he could utilise the same cinematography style used by Snyder but unfortunately that all the slow motions and zooming in are used wrongly and unnecessary. It's a follow up that is totally not on par as "300", although with a good 3D, audiences are heavily presented with a combination of "wine-tomato sauce-video games" splashing bloody scenes, poorly CGI creation, familiar story with plot holes and a powerful score but mimicking Hans Zimmer's Man of Steel. The outstanding and surprising performance from Eva Green might be able to keep audiences' attention but it is still undeniable that the use of few hundreds muscle men as slavery to this joke has tremendously spoiled the art of ancient war.

Entertaining. Glorious graphics and astonishing dark backdrop over sea was an intelligent choice. Action sequences are all packed with blood & mutilated body parts.. quite terrific in 3D. Eva Green rocks as usual. Point is, when watching the movie couldn't stop thinking how Gerard Butler would be as the main start cast. Unfortunately can't expect that as the character came to an end. The transformation of Xerses to God King was good, without any excitement. Plot of the movie is while Spartans fight against evil, Athens too was fighting with evil God King and how they motivated by King Leonidas sacrifice. Overall, it is good to watch in IMAX- 3D. Hope the next sequel will have an effective star cast.

So, the last stronghold of men has been pillaged. The original 300 was about strong, brave, reckless men who would die for glory. This sequel is about a girl who outwits the whole Persian empire and defeats men in their own game. Eva Green's character was so unnaturally forced into 300's universe just to have that "strong female main character" that it was obscene. No Leonidas, no Spartans, a childish Xerxes whose only role in the film was to be an idiot so that Eva Green character's "wittiness" could come to light, and a terrible main character (forgot his name already). I won't even go into the storyline because the real story here is that the spirit of the original 300 has been utterly destroyed. This movie is so politically correct it's stupid, I guess this is what gets money nowadays. I just really hope this movie does badly so that the people who made it give a second thought before killing a franchise next time.Only part worth mentioning: Eva Green's topless scene.

I can't help, but to compare this movie to the similar movie that came out earlier this year, Pompeii. Pompeii did not have necessarily a better story, but the filmmakers did a better job at flushing it out in my opinion. Pompeii really suffered from the cheap CGI effects, which brought it down for me. Rise of an Empire is the opposite.I love the special effects and the CGI in this movie. Though Zack Snyder who directed the first 300, was only the producer of this one, his style of making a comic book come to life visually on the silver screen is all over this. It's one of the things I think we all loved about the first 300 (and Zack Snyder as a filmmaker) how he took Frank Miller's art work and brought it into motion almost like animation. Not as well as Robert Rodriguez did for Sin City, but that's because In a time when comic book movies are in, Snyder is a comic book artist in his own right. His film making on 300 was the difference between Frank Miller doing the artwork himself, or having Jim Lee or Alex Ross do it for him. The story of Rise of an empire is happening Simultaneously with the story in 300 . Both movies are about The Greeks battle with the Persian army, but while 300 is about King Leonidas leading 300 men against a Persian army that greatly out numbers them, Rise of the Empire is about Themistokles, a man attempting to unite Greece to face the much larger Person army. An event that happens at the same time as the event in 300, you can see this throughout the whole movie. the movie also gives an origin story to the Persian king saw in the first movie, and for me this is where the best part of the story begin and ends. After the birth of the God king the movie's plot seems to be too uninteresting it feels like they are trying to be as politically intriguing as House of Cards, but of course it's not. Like Pompeii this movie takes place in a time when sword to sword combat was bad ass and the movie gives you more than you can handle. Unlike Pompeii the visual effects on this flick are top notch, so making a Greek painting come alive as this movie attempts, succeeded greatly. In fact, the movie's greatest achievement is glorying amazing Greek battles, as if though director Noam Murro was a Italian renascence painter, or comic book artist, that latter being more true, considering the amount of over- exaggerated CGI blood spilled. Sometimes I wish there was more to it though. Eva Green as the bad guy, Artemisia was amazing,but I feel all the good guys you should cheer for are too lackluster. You could say the movie could have used a big name like Gerald Butler to play the hero, but on the flip side, I had no idea who Butler was when 300 came out and he was anything but forgettable as Leonidas. I'm a little bit bias about my feelings for Rise of an Empire, as I'm a huge comic book fan and I greatly enjoyed seeing this Graphic Novel move across an Imax screen in 3D. It's worth seeing just for that, but the problem is you have to get through a story that I lost interest in too early on.

The newest installment in 300 series shows actions which you could describe as both as prequel and sequel to the original film. Many questions from the first film will be answered and just as well new ones will be made.The storyline of the film is interesting and follows historical events with a few slight changes to the reality to make things more interesting and fun for the viewer. Nonetheless, you can't consider story as the best aspect of the film.Most impressive in the film was the play by Eva Green who played Artemisia, the antagonist. Her actress play was confident, strong and very impressive. In my opinion she outdid all the others actors who took part in the film and made this a really enjoyable experience for me.Also the use of 3D effects is very good and this is one of the films who have enough effects to really pay more to get the 3D edition. Overall, also the sound effects were very good.To summarize, the film is a must see for any swords&sandals fan, war film fan and also action film fan. Good effects and great actor play especially by Eva Green should make this a good experience.

Zack Snyder's original "300" was quite impressive when it came 8 years ago, which good effects and perhaps the best graphic novel put on the big screen ever.The eight years gone past since then has given us even better techniques and amazing real like CGI seen in films like "Life of Pi" and "Kon-Tiki". I was afraid the sequel of 300 wasn't able to understand why the first was so amazing, and I was right. The CGI isn't better, and the visuals move away from the graphic novel feel of the story. What's even worse is the blood splatter which is so heavily over driven that is looks like dry blood. Too much of a graphic novel, there. It even has the color of dry blood! When if also is falsifying so badly the story, that there almost isn't anything left, and the story sleek fails to deliver character building for more than two persons. I also despised the rough sex and the too slow motion in fight scenes. The film actually almost stalls so much you could go to the bathroom without missing the next blood spatter. The final negative thing is the use of Australian and British, even Scottish dialog. I'm sure the British empire wasn't involved in wars in old Greece, and that the soldiers at least looked Greek.So then, what's good? Well the story is mildly entertaining, when it doesn't bore you midways. An abrupt ending is OK. We stopped believing the story telling s long time ago. The rise of an empire isn't depicted at all. The actors are doing good, past the macho dialog and scenes. I would also say the the start is very good. It attached the story great to the first. So it's a bit entertaining, but still a great let down from the first, which will always be a classic.

I'm coining the new term "Concurquel" to describe this movie. It deftly weaves its narrative before, during, and after the events of the original 300 film. It's neither a true sequel nor a true prequel. I'd like to see more movies follow this pattern.Beginning the with rise of Xerxes and how he came to power, the film allows Xerxes to retain the original 300 as his movie, and Artemisia takes the reigns for this film. Eva Green is evil and exquisite as the "former" Greek, Artemisia, hell-bent on watching Athens burn after her family suffered at the hands of the Hoplites. Whereas 300 was a land battle with slight references to the navy, 300 ROAE is pretty much all naval fighting, but don't let that make you think there is no hand-to-hand. There's enough to spare. Heavy on CGI blood and slow motion, if you didn't like 300, you won't like ROAE.I found Sullivan Stapleton to much less charismatic than Gerard Butler, but he still carries the film well enough, though I keep thinking of Simon Pegg each time I see him.Absent from this film are the strange monsters and giants of the first film, except for a brief glimpse of some unusual sea life which could merely be part of a hallucination. I know the first film got some grief for including those types of creatures, so this leaves it up to you whether these sea baddies are real or not.I didn't find the 3D to be spectacular, so unless you just have to see things that are available in 3D, then 2D is acceptable.Stapleton and Green have plenty of chemistry and their meeting aboard the battle barge is memorable.I hope there will be a third movie if there is enough material, but I don't want to wait 5 years to get it. Everyone will have to get that CGI makeover and that's just not worth it.

This sequel of an all-time favorite cult classic seriously disappoints: considering they had so much good going for them, they really blew the chance. For one, the plot is based on a historical episode "Battle of Salamis" which in fact, had a bigger role to play in securing Greek victory over Persians than the "Battle of Thermopylae" depicted in the original 300. You might like this movie ONLY and ONLY if you have not seen the original 300. And why call this one "300" anyway? The Battle of Salamis was not fought by 300 Greeks but at least 10000-- the title itself is misleading. And as you watch the events unfold before you, the inconsistencies start adding up and if you have an above average IQ, it WILL eventually kill your interest.The sequence of events wasn't lengthy but within the first 10 minutes, the plot became clichéd and boring. I slept through the remaining movie except for 1 or 2 scenes. One might be forgiven for pinning the blame on Frank Miller's, he was unable to make the comic sequel (on which this movie is based) as interesting as the original 300 which managed to grab your attention within the first 10 minutes itself. As time went on, the drama was rapidly unfolding before you and combined with an all-powering action, you knew that it would certainly head for a brilliant climax - the last stand of Leonidas and his men was EPIC of magnificent proportions. Now you can't change the events of history but it was certainly possible to make 300: The Rise of Empire more interesting. You have to use a different formula. The character of Xerxes was totally wasted on this one; I was done with him after the original 300 and in no mood to watch him again as this wasn't his episode!! In fact, Xerxes didn't participate at all in the Battle of Salamis and left it to his generals why devote so much screen time to him including over 10 minutes of background on how and why he became a God-King. Totally pointless.Another historical inaccuracy: Darius I of Persia didn't die from an arrow wound in the Battle of Marathon but 3 years later peacefully in his bed. You can certainly take a few liberties when documenting history in a cinema but not so much that it distorts the original events. Another inaccurate idea was the premise that Artemesia saw her family massacred before her eyes, got sold into slavery and was discarded to perish before being picked up by a kind Persian emissary. That's not correct as wikipedia suggests she was a Queen in her own right. Factually speaking, many Greeks were satrapies of Persians and were entirely devoted to Xerxes. The background of Artemesia has been filled with wild imaginatons and takes away the story's credibility.The acting was tolerable at best and second rate at worst. None of the characters seem to be speakng their dialogs with any sense of conviction except for one scene where Themistokles blurts out "we choose to die on our feet, rather than live on our knees!" -- I liked that one, the only dialog inspiring enough in a movie filled with bad writing. Only a bad writer can write something so unoriginal as:1. XERXES" Today we will dance across the backs of dead Greeks (yawn) 2. ARTEMESIA: I will attack the Greeks with my entire navy! (No points for that, genius) 3. QUEEN GORGO: Leonidas is dead THEMISTOCLES: Then avenge him (Wow, that was sooo original!!) 4. XERXES: Nothing will stop the march of my empire! (Enough already, I need my aspirin now)Not a single dialog in this pathetic sequel comes close to the immortal line "THIS IS SPARTA". Gerard Butler kicked ass as Leonidas none was disagree with that statement...whatever the actor was who played Themistocles, he seriously sucks. A truly forgettable performance.As for Eva Green playing Artemeisa, to be fair, she acted well but the script let her down. Her dialogs were cheesy and totally lacked depth. Oh, they didn't forget to add a sex scene, but it was so corny and must have been played out a million times in C-grade porn movies...less said about it the better.Was there anything redeemable about this movie? Hmm...difficult to answer but let us say 5 years down the line when you check on your DVD collection and come across a copy of the original 300, you will still want to see it again...I saw the original 300 probably 50 times and it's still as fresh. As for this pathetic sequel, it will soon be forgotten in the annals of history - the rubbish bin of bad movie-making.Methinks the movie-makers of current generation have become a LAZY LOT...they lack the craft and ingenuity required in telling a good story. Now that would be an unfair statement, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET holds its own in this entire season of mediocre and over-hyped movies - another piece of drivel being Dallas Buyer's Club. Whoever likes that movie and this so-called "300 sequel", please let me know so I can unfriend you on Facebook.

Well that was unexpected. Capitalizing in the huge fame and legacy that the first film generated, "300: rise of an empire" seemed to be the most unnecessary sequel of all time. Based on the yet still unpublished Frank Miller comic, ROAE certainly lacked Zack Snyder behind the camera and the charismatic turn of Gerald Butler in the now iconic role of Leonidas. After 8 years, it is kinda weird that the sequel appears now, in a film era where the then novel green screen and uber slo mo effects are now typical, mediocre and standardized in hyperstylistic Hollywood action sequences. So.....how does this one fare?Well, it is actually pretty good. Loosely based on the battle of Salamis where Xerxes' navy was pwned by the small (remaining) Greek fleet, "Rise of an empire" offers plenty of the jaw dropping candy and action that made the first film so memorable. Only it just cranks them up to 11. Noam Murro (a director with the credentials of the romantic comedy "Smart People" and some commercials) does not inspire actual confidence before watching a sword and sandal Greek epic. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised to see money shot after money shot delivered with epic zooms and astonishing camera work. Murro definitely brought his Snyder notebook on this one and it feels more of an expansion of a style rather than pure imitation. "Rise of an empire" has astonishing visuals, and simply it is a feast for the eyes. Each shot has a poetic beauty (a night on a rocky beach with a huge moon) and even the most violent and gory scenes carry with them enough magnificence ready to enchant you. It is like watching a hyper realistic movie canvas becoming alive in front of you. Assisted by gorgeous cinematography by Simon Duggan, Murro stages his set pieces in fantastical locations combined with a witty production design from Patrick Tatopoulos (Independence Day, Godzilla, Underworld, Silent Hill). It is style over substance but man what style!Now, let's be honest, we are not here for the context of the film neither to see if it is accurately depict the historical events that shape pretty much the fate of then ancient Greece. As a Greek I take no offence on that. I am here to see action fantasy cinema and nothing more than that. If there is a good depiction in the films is the heroic deeds of Athenians that tried to fight off a huge navy with inventive ways (and smaller ships). Everything else (non character wise), is pure fiction Instead we get bloody, gorgeous action with eye popping visuals in 3D. Obviously, the characters are literally one dimensional with any backstory added in matter of seconds and there is not a moral ambiguity regarding their actions (and consequences). Murro moves from a set piece to a set piece with only a handful speeches giving us a break from the displayed massacre. Carnage you want, carnage you get. I lost count of the bodies that went flying, chopped, burned, etc more than once. If war is your thing, then rest assured you will not be disappointed. Especially, when it is presented in such poetic fashion. Surely though that does not mean that everyone is going to like this. those annoyed with Snyder's style and visuals will find little to love here. Those of use who embraced (and there are many) oh dear, you are for a treat. The cast is rather interesting with Lena Headey doing a good job as Queen Gorgo. Sullivan Stapleton is by no means Gerald Butler but surprisingly he brings some gravitas into the film and it was wise to have him as a smaller built hero than Leonidas who relies more on his brains rather his warrior skills to defeat his opponents. Rodrigo Santoro (by far the most intriguing visually character) still suffers from limited screen time with zero development (no the start does not count) or any special skills since he became a god king. So the whole film relies on Eva Green's shoulders as the poisonous Artemisia, commander of the Persian navy. She chews the scenery and it is almost impossible to take your eyes of her, first because she is gorgeous to look upon and secondly because she is the only one to have a bit of psychological synthesis for her role. Green seems to be having a blast and is one of the probably the best female villains on the big screen in the last decade (along with Faora). So this is "300: rise of an empire". It is a great film? No. However, it is one of the best looking movies of all time and for that it is required to be seen in the cinema in immersive 3D and IMAX! There are tones of great and swift action, epic money shots and fantastic cinematography. No point really if you miss that on the big screen! Sometimes style is all you need baby! It is like watching a huge building being demolished. It does not last for long, is shallow, but the spectacle of the moment is fascinating to witness.+ stunning visuals + 3D is actually a character on its own + Eva Green, great villain and performance + excellent action + Stapleton is adequate but ... - but he is no Gerald Butler - one dimensional characters - story does not really go anywhere7/10

first of all i didn't like the first movie (300) for both being too unrealistic and fictional like comic books. but this one look better in acting section and better computer design but unfortunately the story is still out of sense and watching this is actually like watching 300 in a better and more bearable graphics which is more than enough to entertain some one once but as you watch for the second and so you will notice some imperfection in design and not as good looking as Spartacus which was better in many ways that you will understand when u watch it. hope u enjoy the movie :D and at the end i hope the true story, be filmed one day

1. The back story of the villains in this film is more interesting than the story of the 2-dimensional leads in it. 2. The cartoon blood was distracting. I half expected to see some ACME Anvils land on some Persian dude's head. 3. The slow motion to fast motion gimmick was old 5 years ago, and if we want to see 300 style action sequences, we will watch 300. Beautiful imagery, but I'd rather see paintings of it rather than 2 hours of slow- mo. 4.Under explained stakes and characters. I still have no idea why anyone was fighting and what they were fighting over really. And furthermore I felt more sad for the lead villain who was raped repeatedly as a slave child rather than the leading men who think it's cool to have sex with the enemy. And the other heroes from 300 are a culture of people who not only beat children but discard BABIES if they are not born perfectly. These are our heroes? The Persians at least didn't mention that in their back story. 5. This film is almost all exposition. Nearly 80% of the dialogue is either Braveheart style speeches to 10,000 soldiers who somehow can hear one man without a microphone, or two over-acting characters speaking in inconsistent British accents to remind the audience of what's going on and what they're going to do. 6. If you can't get Gerard Butler to perform ANY speaking lines in the film, just cut him out completely. It was laughable how many times they did the "OH, Your favorite character, GERARD BUTLER, JUST left..you JUST missed him..so here is stock photos from the last movie of him...and oh his wife and this guy were in the last movie...and you know them...so they will speak on his behalf" 7. King Leonidas' wife is just as skilled as any Spartan on the battlefield and leads them from the front lines? OK. 8. If Hollywood is going to only make remakes, reboots, and adaptations of earlier works, they should at very least think a bit more on the script before pooping it out. There is no substance in this film, no real story, no stakes, and worst of all, no serious supporting actor. 9. On a positive note, the extras in this film are HILARIOUS. Comedy gold. 10. I cannot take this movie seriously, and I am their target audience. Worth a DVD rental for some fun, but even in 3D it gets old.Try again Hollywood cash-cow Inc.

The "B" side or flip side of the first film is told here. This is what was going on as the 300 battled to the death. Much of the same, by the time we get to see our fiftieth slow motion slash with blood spurt it starts to grow a bit repetitive. It did strike me that there are a record number of beheadings. Anyway, what worked in the first film works here but the problem is it actually felt fresh the first time around. This feels a bit like a retread but at least the story comes to a satisfying resolution. Eva Green makes a great villainess and the character of Themistokles is as good as King Leonidas. SPOILER: their "talk" during the heat of battle was both baffling and titillating and I guess that was the point. Eva Green not going topless would have seemed wrong. Overall, I can't imagine anyone that liked the first movie not enjoying this one.

Seen in IMAX 3-DWhen 300 burst onto the scene seven years ago, Zack Snyder stated that it would change the way "sword and scandal" movies were viewed. In a way, he was correct. Its lush visuals and frenetic action sequences were something we've never seen before on film. It went on to become a huge success (grossing almost five hundred million dollars worldwide) so evidently, a sequel was inevitable. Seven years later we finally get that sequel and while it might not be as good as 300, it provides its fair share of thrills and visually spectacular moments. 300: Rise of an Empire is not only a sequel, but also a prequel and a companion piece to 300. The beginning takes place ten years before 300 where we see Persia's first attempt at invading Greece. Persia is defeated when General Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) of Athens takes out King Darius. During that time we see Darius's son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) ascend to the throne. It is here where we witness how Xerxes transforms into the man we see in 300. Fast forward ten years later and Persia once again invades Greece. This is when the movie mirrors 300; it takes place during the events in 300, but in a different location. While King Leonidas and his army are away battling Xerxes, Themistocles and his army are taking care of the rest of the Persians at sea commanded by Artemisia (Eva Green). Most of the movie takes place here as we see battle after battle until Themistocles hears word that King Leonidas and his army have been defeated. The last act of the film attempts to tell what happens after 300, when Leonidas and his army have fallen.One of the best things about 300 was Gerard Butler and his larger than life performance as Leonidas. Initially, they planned for him to come back, but he didn't want to reprise his role. He is sorely missed here and the void left by his absence is never really filled although, Eva Green comes awfully close. She by far has the most interesting character and easily gives the best performance, but despite a tragic backstory, she's a villain, which makes it hard to sympathizer with her character. Instead, we get Stapleton to take Butler's place and while his performance is fine, his character Themistocles is no Leonidas. Most people will probably be seeing this for its visuals and epic battle sequences. In that case, this film will not disappoint. Visually, this movie is just as impressive as its predecessor. It's only in-between the battles that this movies falters. Not a lot of what Themistocles has to say is interesting and his speeches aren't nearly as memorable as Leonidas' pep talks. Suffice to say, you won't be seeing any internet memes or hear people quoting this movie as much at the first film. Thankfully, these scenes are short and it doesn't take long before the movie cuts to another battle. Having seen this film in 3D, my advice would be to skip it. It's not so much how the filmmakers use it (they use it to great effect); it's the way it looks that's the problem. Since this is an already dark film with its muted colors and that fact that almost every battle (and most of this movie for that matter) either takes place at night or on a gloomy day, the 3D makes these scenes even darker. On more than one occasion I took off the glasses for a couple of minutes because it was so much brighter and I could see what was going on better. I would still advise you to see it in IMAX if you can, but the 3D nearly ruined some of the action sequences for me. See it in 3D at your own risk, yes the globs of blood hurling at you are pretty cool, but it's not as fun when you can't see what's going on. The best thing than can be said about this film is that it's never boring. It moves at a nice pace from battle to battle, but those looking for the same experience the first film gave them will be disappointed. With the exception of Eva Green, the performances aren't as good this time around, the big speeches are boring, and if you thought there was less substance in the first film, there's even less here. That's not why people want to see these films though; they want to see men with chiseled bodies and bulging biceps slicing their way through the enemy and winning the battle. The film delivers in that regard, and based on the way this ended, it's clear that if this makes enough money at the box office (which it probably will), we'll be seeing another one of these in the near future.

This movie was absolutely a waste of my time and my money. I went to my local theater on March 7th which is also my birthday and I wanted to see the movie based on the performance of the first 300.The first 300 had catharsis, it had actual character development and made you want to keep going. This new 300, "rise of an empire" was absolutely horrendous. Rise of an empire, what empire? This Great War that united the Greeks was barely touched on. It was all about the blood and the guts and breasts. I don't mind nudity. I don't mind blood. But the way the director went about it only cheapened the experience. This movie has a line in it "you fight harder than you f***" (Artemisia). It could have been beautiful and filled with the promise of something both hilarious and invigorating if the scene it referred to had not been so vulgar. 300 Rise of an Empire was not worth the money I spent on it. There are books out there on this point in history, historical fiction books that have stronger character development than this script. The actors did the best they could with what they had, but writers and director, you owe the public an apology for this poor display of cinematic "genius". It was cheap, crude and not well thought out. I had higher hopes. Next time actually make something worth watching.

300: Rise Of An Empire is a popcorn experience of the grandest kind. If you aren't a fan of the first then this one probably won't win you over. Still a totally awesome montage of Bloody stylized fights and epicness! Pretty good for a paraquel ..The action is what you would expect, fast paced to slow motion throughout with some truly awesome brutality. So if you want to see a Action pack! This is your movie. I recommend seeing this in 3D! The sound, the action sequences really do Pop out! And make this movie one hell of a ride!All summed up and 300: Rise of an Empire accomplishes much more than any movie of its kind could aspire to.

I loved the original 300. It was the most satisfying movie I've ever seen. It delivered on every expectation I had. Unfortunately, 300: Rise of an Empire did not.This movie tries to recreate original 300's magic but fails at every point. The visuals were bleak. Actions scenes were kind of repetitive. A lot of them were done with CGI which didn't look real. The main character, Themistocles, just wasn't as badass as Leonidas. I didn't care much for him. If I dare say it, there is too much plot. Or rather it's too convoluted. There is a bunch of factions of half naked guys and I don't know/care what they were trying to do. Overall, this movie is just boring.On a side note, rise of what empire are they are talking about? There were never really any Greek empires, definitely nothing around that period. I know, I know this is not a movie that should be expected to be accurate but still this is a major point.

I saw "300: Rise of an Empire", starring Sullivan Stapleton-Strike Back_t.v., Gangster Squad; Eva Green-Dark Shadows_2012, Casino Royale_2006; Rodrigo Santoro-What to Expect When You're Expecting, Lost_t.v. and Lena Headey-The Purge, The Brothers Grimm.When I first heard about this movie, I was wondering if it was going to be a sequel or a prequel. Well, it's actually both. It starts by showing how Rodrigo-the 10 foot tall giant bad guy from the first movie-became who he became, the Persian god king-he started out as a normal sized man. It shows Rodrigo marching on Greece after his epic battle with the Spartan 300-and there are a few scenes with Gerard from the original movie spliced in but there is no new footage. Sullivan plays the leader of a Greek naval fleet that tries to unite Greece against the invading Persian forces and Eva is Rodrigo's commander of the military-she knows how to hold her own in a fight and she can defeat almost any man. Lena has a small role-as the widow of Gerard from the first movie-but she does get to participate in the sword fighting as well. Most-but not all- of the battles are on ships at sea and they are all bloody. I think this movie is even more violent and bloody than the original. During fights, you will see arms, legs and even heads removed from their owners, with gallons of spraying blood and it looks pretty realistic. There is also nudity. There is one sex scene that is almost like a battle-ripping clothes, hitting, slinging each other across the room-and later, the girl tells the guy that he fights better than he makes love-she did not use those words, but you catch the drift. I heard the song, War Pigs by Black Sabbath when the end credits started and they left it wide open for another sequel. I saw it in IMAX 3D and it looked great. It's rated "R" for bloody violence, language and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes. I enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.

After seven long years, the commercially praised 300 finally receives its prequel/coincidequel/sequel with 300: Rise of an Empire. In an attempt to reignite life back into fans with an all new cast of characters to rain chaos down on Xerxes and his Persian army, Rise of an Empire sadly does not come close to bringing the same caliber of excitement 300 had. Check out the full spoiler-free review of the film after the break.Taking into consideration that the naval Battle of Artemisium between Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) and Artemisia (Eva Green) coincides with the Battle of Thermopylae – the tale of 300 and King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) – 300: Rise of an Empire is pretty historically accurate. But of course we need to add Frank Miller's razzle dazzle, colorful characters and monsters, thousands of buckets of CGI blood, and as much violence and sex as possible – and then add more violence on top of that. Rise of an Empire also tells the story before Thermopylae and the 300 Spartans as well as the aftermath thereof.For a story that takes place before, during, and after the events of its predecessor, 300: Rise of an Empire has a tall order to fill. And for being less than two hours, the film feels excruciatingly longer than what the time line of the narrative suggests it would be. In fact, 300 is 13 minutes longer and takes place over a shorter period of time than Rise of an Empire. What makes this movie such a monster to endure is the disconnect between uninteresting character developments sans Artemisia and the abundance of ultra violence and mayhem.Rise of an Empire works out of the same mold 300 did whereas it stylizes violence in the most visually compelling way while incorporating as many slow motion shots as possible. If it was their ultimate goal to match the vision of Zack Snyder, but with darker tones shot in 3D, then the filmmakers have succeeded on all fronts. Moviegoers looking for that same effect won't be disappointed by any means. Surprisingly the 3D isn't that terrible either. The worst offender of the cinematography is the random, extreme close ups of the action and our inability to follow the scene clearly. Composer Junkie XL does a decent job at matching the heavy metal sounds of Tyler Bate's original score from 300, so much so that it feels familiar in tone yet he is able to make it his own.However, beyond the aesthetics, Rise of an Empire fails to create a sense of satisfaction or accomplishment through all of the cut limbs, slit throats, and bloodbaths that worked so well in 300. The stakes of Themistokles and his Athenian warriors are not conveyed as well personally as those of the Spartans. The theme of freedom throughout Greece is hammered home repeatedly by the many lackluster speeches spoken by Themistokles. Unfortunately, Stapleton lacks a certain level of confidence, swagger, and charisma that Butler had; and being physically fit only covers half of the role. It's as if he just tried to mirror Butler's Leonidas without trying to make the character his own.And equipped with nipple shields, no help is given by his comrades played by Hans Matheson, Jack O'Connell, and Callan Mulvey, who have less character and personality than a head of cabbage. Unlike the Spartans, we do not get enough facts to support these men in war other than the fact that their homes are being threatened. The Athenians are all able to leave the battle whenever they would like because they are free Greeks and that message hasn't been said enough, but they choose to stand by Themistokles' side with little or no reasoning because YOLO, practically. Every Athenian death doesn't really amount to much unlike the Spartans who fought to make Greece realize their stupidity.But luckily for us, 300: Rise of an Empire has Eva Green, whom without this film would be as lifeless as Kristen Stewarts' eyes. Green's portrayal of Artemisia lights the screen on fire with so much energy, raw passion, and enthusiasm; she may be the only one who understands they're in a 300 movie. Artemisia is so ruthless, cunning, sexy, and absolutely terrifying that she easily joins the ranks of some of the most feared villains in the history of cinema. Whether she uses her tactical prowess to dominate out on the high seas or in the bedroom, the power Artemisia possesses is unmatched by anyone else. Eva Green makes me believe in a world where more strong, female villains in Hollywood need to be realized.Despite having a much larger scale and an increased budget, director Noam Murro was defeated by a lukewarm screenplay written by Zack Snyerand Kurt Jonstad, which he himself should be to blame as well as a director for not improving on the material he is given. Rise of the Empire also doesn't work too well as a standalone film, as it often brings up many references and characters from 300 to remind us of a better time at the movies. Murro has a decent eye for action, but pays too much attention to Artemisia's development than anyone else, making the survival of the Athenians 300: Rise of an Empire hard to care for without truly understanding them.

Alright. So, after being a huge fan of the original 300 when it came out, I knew I had to see this movie when I heard about it.I read reviews and everything, and was convinced it was good. So I went into the movie theater expecting it just be "good." However, after finally seeing it, I'm blown away.There is a lot of the slo-mo action sequences, and I mean a lot. The gore and blood is completely excessive, but is still so freaking awesome. Even though there are elements (like the blood, slo-mo, etc.) that are repetitive, they don't feel repetitive because of how Awesome they are. I could watch the slo-mo sequences all day. Overall, my friends that I went with and I, are extremely satisfied.

"Rise of an empire" can be called both the prequel and the sequel to "300". Most appropriately, however, it should be considered the "parallel-quel", if I can be allowed to coin such a word. The main set piece of the movie, well over a half-hour in the middle of the 100 minute affair, is a sea battle taking place concurrently with the epic battle depicted in "300". While Xerxes does battle on land against the "300" Spartans, his ablest general Artemisia (Eva Green) brings her fleet against the small navy from Athens. Both Greek city states are spontaneously undertaking a David-vs-Goliath heroic act.Let me back up a little. The prequel portion of this movie shows how 10 years ago, Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) killed Persian King Darius with an arrow during a battle, which set off a chain of events, the most important of which was turning the King's son, a normal young prince at the start, into the campy god-king Xerxes we saw in "300". Instrumental to this was Artemisia, who pulled all the strings behind this new iconic symbol of the Persian Empire. Her own history is revealed a little later in the movie in another flashback: her family annihilated and herself ravished by fellow-Greeks during in-fights. Eventually saved and trained by the Persian to be their best general, she vowed to return one day to Greece to avenge herself.The main body of the movie, the "parallel-quel" as mentioned, pitches Themistokles against Artemisia in the best set piece, as well as some fiery erotic action between two superb fighters and strategist who appreciate each other's excellence and attempt to win over each other to their side. When neither succeeds, there is a predictable finale.While technically this movie offers everything "300" offered, it lacks the fire and spirit of Gerard Butler's King Leonidas. Sullivan Stapleton comes across as rather dull and his Themistokles even fails to elicit Queen Gorgo's (Lena Heady, not much more than cameos here) support initially. Somewhat of a redeeming attraction is Green, a deliciously alluring villain. But that is not enough to elevate this movie, made obviously to milk a cash cow, to the level of "300".

The sequel to the surprise action flick 300. When the first 300 was announced I had little hope for it, and it proved me wrong turning out to be a surprise hit that year. This was what I had imagined the first one too be like. An uninspired average movie with buckets of blood and wooden characters. Yes I'm sorry fans of the original but this movie is pretty damn average. First there was the acting. It was average to say the least other then Eva Green as the villain. Then there was the script. Wait was there a script? Or did they just get 5 year old kids to repeatedly video the same fight scenes over and over again? I mean seriously how many times do I want too see the same damn fight scene! Then there was the blood. While the first movie used the blood to their advantage, using it as a arty substance, this movie however does the opposite with over top blood being used way too much and way too heavily. The fight scenes were basically speed up slow down sword thrust speed up slow down head removal speed up slow down arm removal and that's it. That's literally almost the whole movie summed up. Some action junkies may enjoy this but to me it was an uninspired, over the top gore fest, that I for one would not want to watch again.

300: Rise of an Empire﻿ movie review- Old wine in old bottleHistorians say the 5th century Greco Persian wars had a seminal impact on the world. If the Greeks had not stood up to the might of the Achaemenid Empire﻿, maybe the East would have been ruling the West, there would have been no Alexander the Great﻿, and an united Europe would have but been a distant dream. The wars, spread over 50 years were marked by three landmark battles, which had a common theme- bravery in the face of insurmountable odds. The battle of Marathon which recorded the first victory the Greeks achieved against the superior forces of Persia. Second was the most famous rearguard action in the history of mankind- the battle of Thermopylae﻿ where 300 Spartans held off the entire Persian army. And the third was the twin naval battles of Artemisium﻿ and Salamis, where 300 Greek ships along with sheer luck and a bit of weather on their side, overpowered a 1200 ship strong Persian navy. If anything, the three battles together brought about the death of an empire, not the rise."Seize your glory!"2006's 300﻿ was about Thermopylae. Based on Frank Miller﻿'s yet to be released graphic novel, 300: Rise of an Empire sweeps across all above three influential stories. While a number of old characters such as Lena Headley﻿ (Queen Gorgo), and Rodrigo Santoro﻿ (Xerxes), reprise their roles from 300, history takes a backseat here, as we are introduced to Themistocles, played by Sullivan Stapleton﻿, who is supposedly the common thread in all the three battles. While the actual Greek character was a politician, this dude here is apparently the one who felled the Persian king Darius at Marathon, and also responsible for letting Xerxes getting away first time round. He also seems to be the only one who dreams of an united Greece, and pitches this idea to the Spartans, but a bit too late for Leonidas and his men. he is also around to delivers the coupe de grace to the Persian navy at Salamis. While a lot of back story is given on how Xerxes acquired his god king status, Artemisia is the crucial new character introduced in this novel. Played with gleeful joy by Eva Green﻿, she is the accomplished Persian naval commander, portraying bloodthirsty and smoking hot at the same time.That director Noam Murro﻿ did not want to tamper with a successful formula is both good and bad. Good because considering the source, there is the usual hyperbole all around, ultra violent slow motion action cuts, supernatural monster elements, globules of 3D blood generously splotched all over the screen, and punchline spewing beefcakes, and romanticized notions about love, honor, freedom and beautiful deaths that will satiate the fan-boys. Bad, because this is like old wine in old bottle. Granted the overall action is better and less cartoonish than that in 300, the naval battles are beautifully pictured, and there is some attempt at a plot. But at an overall level, Murro does not even attempt to leave a mark, this is just Zack Snyder﻿ part deux. Most of the characters are wooden, and most so is the hero. He errs big time in casting Stapleton as the one man who strings it all together for the franchise. Straight off Strikeback, Stapleton is strictly TV material, lacks the charisma and gravitas to step into the shoes vacated by Gerard Butler﻿.Curiously then, history does repeat itself. Just as the 300 Spartans is what most people remember from the Greco-Persian wars even though Salamis was a more crucial encounter, so does Rise of an Empire struggle to emerge from the benchmarks set by 300. It is a slick, stylistic retelling of history that existing fans will enjoy but will struggle to relate to new audiences. 7/10 since i was a fan of the first!

When i heard the news about 300 coming with a second part i thought they are going to humiliate the first one. But i was proved wrong.Rise of an empire gives story behind the epic war. Themistokles kills the Persian king Darius in front of his son Xerxes and Xerves took his vengeance on Greece. Themistokles trying to unite Greece but queen of Sparta denies her approval. Eva Green steals the show and established Artemisia as a powerful character. The fight between Artemisia and Themistokles is much accompanied by such a powerful climax.The hardcore visual treat combined with awesome background music and dialogue presentation gives us goosebumps. we can feel the heat in our bloods. Its been such a big time since such a movie with so much heat has been released. I just loved it. Don't believe in dumb reviews.see for yourself if you want some entrainment

Awesome Movie with some Good performance and Visual Effects. Once again adaptation of a Frank Miller's Coming out Good in Big Screen. The Movie is a Sidequel of 300 Movie. And is better than 300.Eva Green has given a powerful performance. Sullivan Stapleton has done well. Lena Headey and Rodrigo Santoro made impactive performance in their comparatively little screen time.The Theme continues, ambiance is Darker. Visual effects are as good as Previous movie. Stunts were as bloody as 300. Story is Parallel to 300, gives some history of characters. Theron's part could have been included or mentioned to add more to sinister.Music is awesomely complementing the scenes, especially towards the end. Movie is Visual Treat.Its Powerful Vengeful Artemisia V Calm Strong Themistokles.

I've been a vocal critic of the growing trend of hyper-stylized action and over-reliance on CGI in Hollywood films the last decade. So it may come as a bit of a surprise that I'm whole-heartedly recommending a film that is nothing but hyper-stylized action and CGI. I think the difference here is that the '300' films never try to integrate those things into a real world setting. These films are more like comic books in motion.In many ways, 'Rise of an Empire' surpasses the original '300' both technically and dramatically. Where it doesn't quite measure up is with its male lead, where the more than solid Sullivan Stapleton can't hope to match the tour de force charisma of Gerard Butler. But that's okay, because there's Eva Green. Sexy, vicious, scene stealing Eva Green. This may be a male dominated film, but it's Ms. Green who steals the show.If you liked '300', chances are you'll like 'Rise of an Empire'. If you didn't, there's likely nothing here that will change your mind.

To start with its not a sequel or prequel. The events taking place in the movie takes place at the same time when King Leonadius and his spartans (300) go on war with persians. Greek general Themistokles had defeated Daxos (Father of Xerxes) and now Xerxes is on a vengeance to destroy Greece with AThens and Sparta. Themistokles is more modernized leader here and plays war strategically, whereas Arthemisia(Eva green) plays the devilish persian who knows war can be won by any means ie., by betrayal, by sex, by vengeance. Entire story-line rolls around Artemisia and Themistokles as they both are on blood-run for each-other. Action sequences are beautifully shot and brilliantly executed. CGI is great with complete blood bath, where blood falling right on the screen which is kinda heavy dose. Story and screenplay is very powerful this time which creates a good line-up. Performance wise Eva Green as Artemisia is show-stellar who creates an evil aura worth applauding. Sullivan as the HERO Themistokles is decent but in some scenes he couldn't bring the anger the right emotions for the situation required. Zack synder has again given a good flick worth keeping in collection. Though movie might not be as great as 300 but it lives up-to its hype and makes it a good watch.Highly recommended if you are 300 fan.

I saw it last night and thought it was fantastic. When I came out of the cinema my heart was pounding from the jolt of pure movie entertainment.I loved the style, the score and the action scenes. I thought having enjoyed 300 and Spartacus that I'd be tired of the slo mo bits and the blood but far from it. There was invention in the moves and a real feel that Themistokles was a bad ass.Okay he wasn't Leonidas but then he wasn't meant to be. He was more reserved and had a quieter authority about than Butler but Spartans are different to Athenians and hence it was only right for him to be different.He held my attention and his final speech was great for motivating his men in his admission of error and asking for their support as free men. In a world of generic speeches, playing the humility card was refreshing and inspiring.The action scenes were just amazing and allowed you to strategically see the battlefields (or seas). Eva Green's character was great but I don't feel she 'stole' the movie. There has to be foils and opposites to characters so whereas as she was scene chewing, Themistokles brooded heroism.I really liked how it played out before, during and after the Thermopylae (sp) battle making this feel like another part of the tale rather than a sequel. The soundtrack for this so wonderfully complimented all of the actions scenes and I cannot wait to get it on disc. Currently listening to it on YouTube and it's still impressive.A fabulous, wildly entertaining film that I will have to see again at the cinema. I pray that it does well enough to lead to a final instalment that is as well put together as this film.

I remember watching Sullivan Stapleton's powerhouse performance in 'Animal Kingdom'. Expected to see his star rise, but it's bin awhile coming. He definitely owns his role over here, though his characterization is a tad confusing at times. Being front-and-center of this epic retelling of a battle Greece waged with Persia on the seas, while Leonidas and his 300 were occupied elsewhere, this one cleverly interweaves those tales to relate a very engaging account of battles, strategies and vengeance during the same period.A certain narrative device used all through this flick, albeit overused nowadays, is also very clever, and does have the intended 'boo!surprise' effect esp. towards its denouement.Eva Green rules, as she mostly does with the right material, and is engaging almost in every scene she's in. She has a simple backstory, but makes it her own, and tries to rise above the cliché-ed characterization.Lena Headey, on the other hand, has a lot of baggage post-GOT, and that helps, esp. since her screen time is very limited. In spite of that, her specter looms large in every sequence, for more than 1 reason - just the way it did in '300', albeit for a different reason then.Political ploys, backstabbing and prophecies take a backseat, and this is mostly battle-after-battle with some limited screen time for predictable character-building with a couple of soldiers and Xerxes' angst that screams for war. There are quite a few far-fetched battle sequences that are rousing, and wild cheering from the audiences signaled that this one's going to make quite a bit of moolah all over. The nudity and sex was excised from the version I got to watch, and in spite of that, the footage that remains makes for solid entertainment, albeit of the adult variety due to all the violence, blood and gore. I've never been a fan of CGI blood, so it doesn't affect me, sometimes causing unintentional humor, but I think I'm in a minority on that, considering all the reactions around me.Definitely worth a watch, esp. on the largest screen you can find, and once again in the Atmos sound system. I got to watch it on Atmos, but do not have the opportunity for an IMAX 3D version yet.The bad things? Quite a few, but the ones that stood out were the attempts to make inspiring speeches to rally the troops with a booming soundtrack playing in the background. There was no need to do that more than once, esp. when its been done better by Butler's character earlier - just served to show how weak this was in comparison. Mostly unintended humor. Another one that stood out was something puzzling between Xerxes and Artemisia's characters, the chemistry between the two did not seem completely fleshed out - more work could've gone there.Noam Murro - I did not know he had this one in him, considering his pedigree (Smart People).

Recently, I tend to think that the first couple of thousand of votes and reviewers are paid by the studios on IMDb.com and the flick will receive its real score about half a year later.I browsed through dozens of 7 to 10 reviews and I couldn't believe my eyes. Have you seen the same movie I watched yesterday? I loved 300 but this one is a million miles from it. I really don't want to write about the performance of Eva Green and Sullivan Stapleton because they perfectly matched the movie itself: the storyline, the bloody scenes, the dialogs, everything. Forgettable, CGI-packed action with predictable rhythm of "calm" and intense scenes from beginning to end. As far as I remember, the Persians never destroyed Athens and the "rebirth" of Xerxes was also a joke, not to mention the union of Artemisia and Themistokles. 300 was almost a perfect movie but it has nothing to do with its glorious predecessor.

This movie was surprisingly good and visually appealing. It's mildly different to the original 300 with a bulk of battles being naval but was definitely satisfying to watch. I didn't go into 300:RoE expecting it to win Oscars I went for the same reason I saw the original 300, I wanted to see some "bad assery" and yes, they do have those moments and more. Also, Themistocles is a "pimp", watch the movie or read some reviews, I hate spoiling it even though I got the spoil and watched it anyway. It ends well, with both movies tying into one another so as a disclaimer you may want to watch the original 300 if you haven't already but more likely than not if you are wanting to watch this movie it's likely you already have or want to.

. . . ready to pick up their swords and jump onto the deck of enemy warships at the drop of a hat, men respected women. But by the time of the Spanish Armada, Queen Elizabeth I of England was content to host a tea party prayer circle to implore Heaven for freaky weather to destroy the enemy fleet. (That the Brits still speak English proves her prayers were answered.) As much as some folks expect QEII to drop her little white gloves like an NHL goon would at the first hint of an international brawl, THAT ain't gonna happen. However, when you watch 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE, you will relive the days of female fortitude, when women were willing to wield, NOT yield. As one of Themistokles' critics notes, "We are turning young men into memories." That's been even more true during America's recent long string of Un-Won wars. We've been fighting with one hand tied behind our back. First G.I. JANE and now 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE prove we MUST put women back on the front lines of battle to regain our advantage. Money is no substitute for the Power of Estrogen!

Waste of money!!I've never felt compelled to leave a review before but my Husband and I were both very disappointed with this film after both really enjoying the first 300 movie. I was totally bored 15 minutes in but was hoping for something interesting to happen- it never happened!I felt like it was all action/graphics but no story line, the entire film was people getting killed with swords in slow motion, ships bashing into each other like the dodgems and then there was Sullivan Stapleton's bad British accent which was a mixture between British, American and Australian.

Not as good as the first one. The CGI is amazing again but there a few memorable shots of landscapes or angles like the first one had. Every shot of the first 300 could be a screen saver or background, this didn't have as many memorable beautiful shots. The blood looks really fake, the pacing is a bit cramped with too much action, very few emotionally connecting scenes, the soundtrack wasn't memorable at all, few likable characters, few memorable characters, Xerxes pushed to the side and given a clichéd origin story, the ending was anti-climactic, they could have ended it after the finale, but no they had to leave a cliffhanger for the third one, supporting characters suck and aren't half as memorable as the first one, and Eva Green isn't completely naked. It is a fun movie to see with friends, but that's about it. I forgot almost everything that happened the next day. Check it out.

Absolutely epic film!! Blood war and sex. Who needs more? Critic reviews are completely inaccurate as it doesn't contain some weird 'political message' they automatically 'dislike it'. To them, I say go watch your boring films and leave this masterpiece alone. Acting top notch too. The only issue, is the blood. A lot of blood flying everywhere however hardly any on the ground but hey, not complaining. The film is by far my favourite this year and worth every penny at the movies. I also think the fact the film is a prequel and a sequel is pretty darn brilliant. My advice is just go see it people! Ha cant wait for the next instalment!

I like Sullivan Stapleton, but in this movie he didn't shine.Compared to Gerard Butler (Leonidas in the previous "300"), Sullivan looked like a cheap clone.On the other hand, Eva Green was the 'soul' of this movie.Artemisia was the most charismatic character, that's for sure.Rodrigo Santoro (Xerxes) was almost invisible.Lena Headey (Gorgo) was almost invisible.All the other characters were the same like the above two.Talking about the movie itself, excessive violence and blood, poor storyline, but good special FX (something common these days).Technically speaking: 8 out of 10.Artistically speaking: 6 out of 10.My vote: 7 out of 10.

Just saw "300 - Rise of An Empire ". I'm totally surprised, I've appreciate every single moment of this movie. The screenplay isn't heroic like the screenplay for 300 , but this chapter is better than the first movie for splatter scenes with the battles . Artemisia. (Eva Green) she's a beautiful dominatrix. I've really appreciate the plot with the facts in the same time with the battle of 300 , included references. I haven't seen the movie in 3D , because I don't like see movies with the 3D reconverted , for me isn't 3D ( the 70 % circa of 3D movies today). I like see a movie with real 3D filmed with the source camera. Imho, I'm not a fan of this new technology for the cinema , but I approve the "Digital Intermediate Process" as successor of classic 35mm format. I'm very curious to see "Rise of An Empire"with IMAX (75mm).

You can easily see the difference between the first movie with Leonidas and his 300 and the second movie with Themistoclis and his navy.The difference is one but very important.In the first movie they took the real story put some exaggeration and they made a beautiful movie.In this second movie they took the Greek history and they made a salad.And of course the result was a huge mess with no clear scenario overreaction to prove something that no one could understand. p.s i have to point some parts of the movie that we l m a o .... 1)Themistoklis killed Darios ????in Marathonas???????What about the great MILTIADIS??????????????????????????????????????????????? 2)Artemisia? who th f@@@ is Artemisia?????????????????????????? 3)Spartans with ships????Reminds me cats with skateboards........................... 4)If Persians had entered Athens there were no reason to fight in Salamina......(they never took Athens they never burn Athens.....................................) 5)And last... Marathonas battle?The greatest battle in history for you is a sneaky attack??????Come on guys you could read better the history.......

When I first heard of the movie and saw the trailer, part of me got excited and the other half got worried that it may just be another sequel made to juice out some extra money.Well i'm glad to say that it did not disappoint. People seem to forget that the original 300 movie did end on a cliffhanger. The plot was not finished with 300, only the 300 were. The plot of Rise of an Empire successfully continues this story, but this time from the view of someone outside of Sparta seeking their help. I won't say much more, but I will say that you may be glad to know that all the money didn't just go into the CGI and not the script.The plot, though nothing special, is sufficient as a base for the delectable elements of the movie to take place. The action was right on par and maybe even better than the first, with my only complaint being that there was maybe just a tad bit too much slow mo this time around. Most of the acting was believable but not great, with the exception of the brilliantly played villain. The protagonist, though not as bad-ass and inspiring as Leonidas, still had his share of awesome moments, though he was played as a conflicted man who didn't quite match Leonidas' strong will and power, but still held up. Also the ending scene gave me goosebumps, and yes, it is another cliffhanger (guess we're gonna get a trilogy after all)All in all i'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who was a fan of the first film or who just wants to be successfully entertained for 2 hours.

i am sicked and tired of Hollywood mess up with Greek history once again!! for god's shake is it so difficult to study some history before they decide to make a movie based on those facts? we are used to watch them ruin our mythology but it's even worse to do it with our history. where to begin and where to stop? Themistocles had nothing to do with marathon it was Miltiades and he used a brilliant battle tactic which is worth mentioning. Persians did not burn Athens. that was the point of Salamina battle, to defend the city "with wooden walls". I won't comment the scene between Themistocles and Artemisia... such a pity... good photography is not enough to save this mess.

Director Noam Murro tries to infuse Empire with a David-vs.-Goliath view similar to 300's. And credit Empire with giving its actresses substantial action roles. But this film telegraphs its punches like a sword to the eyeball. And there are plenty. Empire promises and delivers a literal tide of blood, which will be welcome news for action aficionados looking for a picture that pulls no punches. But for fans of the story, Empire throws none. Is 300 redux as portending of history? No. Does it wear its ethereal quality as loyally to convey a legend in the making? No. Does it tell its story as effectively? No again.

I thought this movie was entertaining especially how everything is put into the ongoing story line. Its interesting to see how its happening, specially in this part of 300 its more of the Persians. So you see both sides of the story. But i did expect more, at the end i could feel everyone in the cinema feeling disappointed, not like they hated the movie but felt that there had to be more, it was a short movie but still just felt let down compared to the first one. The action in it was awesome, gruesome, violence and good pace. You enjoy it. It really does do well in this part and if not better than the first movie. Though you do miss those 300 Spartans. The characters are good, you do not get the same feel you did from the first movie but still does it well. You really get into more of Artemisia the main villain in this story, you get her back story, her rise to power and through out the movie you see why she is feared by others. Still you did expect more from her. Themistokles i think does well as the main hero of this story but you would not say he was awesome or epic. You really do not get much of a back story of him. So do not get me wrong this movie is a good movie, you will enjoy it if you enjoyed the first one. But if you loved the first one then you will feel a little bit let down. It just feels short and you feel like you were left expecting more. After it you will see why.

Now I am a big fan of the original 300. I even read the comic before the original movie came out and loved how Zack Snyder brought every panel of the comic to life on the big screen. So going into 300: Rise of an Empire (RoaE) I was a bit skeptical especially because it was not directed by Zack Snyder. Instead we have Noam Murro in the director's seat, who's only notable feature film, Smart People, was mediocre at best. Also, he hasn't directed action! However, I have to say he has done a great job in keeping the tone and style consistent with the original 300. The cinematography from the battle sequences to the dramatic scenes were aesthetically beautifully done.I HAVE TO mention the performances of Sullivan Stapleton as Themistokles and Eva Green as Artemisia. To start Themistokles, his character was portrayed very well by Stapleton. He is a strong willed, honorable character willing to sacrifice anything for his people. While I don't think his performance was as memorable as Gerard Butler as Leonidas, Stapleton did a good job in making us, the audience, care about him and his struggles. The highlight of this movie by far has to be Eva Green's performance as Artemisia. She just owns every scene that she is in. Calling her profanities starting with the letters B and C, does not do justice to describe her character (no offense intended). You KNOW immediately never to cross or disappoint her. Eva Green did an incredible job, you as audience will love to hate her. After all, that is what we want from a great villain.So the negatives, well it mostly comes down to the story. It just isn't anything special, but most of us should be fully aware that story is not the point of the movie, it's more the action and characters that are the focus. However, I do find it interesting how they wove the story in with the original movie by showing the events that happened before, during, and after 300. But, I want to make it clear that you don't need to watch 300 to follow what's going on in 300: RoaE. Another weak point I have to say is that the character Xerxes was underutilized. Although we get to learn more about him and his past, he is not directly involved in any of the events of 300: RoaE. That is okay though, because the presence of Artemisia more than made up for it.All in all this was a respectable and enjoyable addition to the universe of 300. I'd recommend it to anyone who was fan of the original or just overall fans of well-choreographed, cinematic action. Enjoy!

300 was such a great movie, so when I seen the trailers of rise of an empire I was so excited even amped the movie up. First day it came out, I had high hopes and couldn't not wait to see the movie. However I was completely disappointed and could not believe that I sat through that entire movie. It's confusing & had excessive amounts of blood, to the point where it made no sense. and the movie looked like a video game at a certain point. I was even more blown away when the Athens all of a sudden could fight. If they were farmers and had pitch forks in 300, how could they have gained so much strength and could actually be a threat to the Persians ? Zercsees looked like he was dipped in gold and was basically chilling throughout the movie. Whatever your thoughts are before the movie, forget about them, your going in for a complete loss. Yes there was more action but the way the movie went was just off. I don't recommend watching this movie, but that's just my opinion.

I am a big fan of the original 300. It's probably in my list of my top 15 favorite movies of all time. The art style, action, and inspiration you feel when seeing those guys fight and rip their enemies to shreds is just awesome. With it's cliffhanger ending, I waited year after year for a sequel and thought it would never come. Finally in 2014, we got the official sequel "300: Rise of an Empire". I was a little worried about this film at first. How could they top the first one? More importantly, how can they do this movie without Gerard Butler, who was the quintessential Spartan leader? Well it turns out they did. And not only was this movie fantastic, but I almost feel as if I enjoyed it more than the original!From beginning to end, this movie tells historical stories like no other. Fantastic cinematics, camera work, audio, and CGI that is actually enjoyable and doesn't take away from the filming experience. Even the sex scene of this movie was epic. These movies are very powerful and there wasn't a dull moment in this movie. More so than the theatrics, this movie has GREAT cast. Eva Green played the evil Artemisia so incredibly well that she practically was this movie. She so perfectly played that bad guy in this film that it was unreal. She is probably the most convincing, twisted villain in a movie since Ricardo Montalban did Khan in Star Trek II in the 1980's. She was just THAT good in this film! We also get to see some familiar faces from the first film, too, which was rewarding.The only minor, little thing that makes it hard for me to give this film a perfect score is the following... although Sullivan Stapleton was great as Themistokles, his performance wasn't quiet on the same level as Gerard Butler's was in the original 300. From his muscular physique to his overall screen presence, I just didn't connect with this guy as much as I did with Gerard Butler. But he was still excellent in the film, and I don't blame him as much as the writers/director. They tried to cram a lot into this movie with telling Atermisia's side of the story, but it worked out well with her in the film. Although I normally complain that a movie is too long, though, this one I think could have been a bit longer to develop his character more, even by just another 5 or 10 minutes of film time. All in all, fantastic film. Eva Green's performance alone is worth seeing it over, she was a true villain in this movie. I recommend it whether you are a fan of the franchise or not. I took my 61 year old mother to see this for her birthday coming up and she also enjoyed it and typically doesn't like gory movies.

It's a barely watchable movie just because of the big crazy battles and the rest is forgettable.The rest i includes a lot of "inspiring" speeches, boring conversations and a little side story about a dad and his son fighting together. This little cute story was made to spark the viewers emotions but it didn't spark mine because it was stupid. When there wasn't a fight on the screen i was mostly picturing the food i was gonna cook later. The scenes with Xerxes were OK because he is an interesting character. PS: I laughed when the persian commander yelled "Rocks!" and drove his ships into rocks that appeared out of nowhere for no reason.

Going into this movie, I thought I'd be seeing the Athenian side of the equation in terms of the Greco-Persian War. Instead I witnessed a movie that debased all the other Greek City-States before Sparta.To get some background the main character of this film, Themistocles, is the driving force behind a united Greek stance to fight the Persians. While in the first film we witnessed a refreshing willingness by the Spartans to stand with their fellow Greeks, in this one we rarely see them, unless its for Themistocles to beg for their assistance. We see a Sparta claiming an unwillingness to sacrifice more men, after having sacrificed a paltry 300 men and a king. And holding in reserve both a navy and army that is apparently a match for anything Persia has.Based on this film, I have to ask, why even bother with the other City-States? Sparta is obviously the strongest thing in the world. Seeing the ending, we witness a Spartan Navy, that numbers-wise is as large as the rest of the Greek navy combined.There is none of the camaraderie we saw in the first film. What little back story there is, is extremely rushed. The antagonist in this one, isn't even Xerxes, but Artemisia, and even she seems uncertain as to whether or not to be a bad guy.In conclusion to my rantish review, this film is not a very good companion film to the original. There is little to connect to in terms of the characters, the antagonist can't really even be termed as such, and the Spartans are built up so much that there might as well not even be other Greek City-States.

Is there a point to this movie? And what's with all the stuff blowing around in the background? At one point, I decided that the theater was having problems with the film and almost left to speak with an employee, but then it was never there during the battle scenes, so it must have been SOMETHING, but it was soooooooo distracting.Not that there was much to concentrate on. Absolutely ridiculous and ultra violent, along with an--Spoiler ALERT--unpleasant sex scene. Another reviewer mentioned romance--no, there was none of that.I went for the special effects, the ship battles, of which there were several. Hundreds of men standing on a flat ship's deck, with no sides or rails, plummeting down the face of a wave of Poseidon proportions, and the men don't even sway a bit. Women engaging in sword fights in skirts (and the men in capes).And the blood. All over the place. If the word "overkill" ever applied to anything, this movie is it. Just when I finally had enough and was ready to walk out, the show mercifully ended.Snickers throughout the theater--and I'm not talking' about the candy bars.But really, what was with the dust/fireflies?

If you enjoyed the first movie, then I think you'll like this one. Just don't expect anything ground breaking. The only complain is I wish they had done this sooner and that Snyder was available to return as director. Noam Murro didn't do a bad job, but Snyder visual eyes was greatly miss.Acting wise, Eva Green was really the only one that stood out. It was also good to see some of the old actors return from the originally 300.All in all, a very fun flick. Looking forward to Part 38/10

This 300 Rise Of A Empire movie was awesome, intense, sexy, action packed and intriguing. Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) was a beast like Achilles great acting was about even with Gerard Butler. Eva Green (Artemisia) was sexy, brutal and insane as any villain I have seen.Xerxes and his story line was great. The way the story pieced together with 300 was magnificent. The low reviews others are giving there on some serious drugs.The battle seen with navy ship best affects I have seen.The movie did not drag or leave me clueless. Really hope that director can carry on to another movie. Enjoyed the new characters and plots.This movie low score 8.5 my score 10!!!

It lacks the unworldly mythologies of the first title, but its spectacular animation will still be entertaining enough. 300: Rise of an Empire is the prequel, event in between and also sequel of 300, this might be overreaching as it cumbersomely tries to tell wider scale background of the war. There are more characters, each with their own tale and the change into naval battle is a welcomed one, not to mention clever ways to divulge more effects, however they can't replace the charm of mystical charisma from the predecessor.Story revolves mainly on Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) and his ambivalence struggle against slightly insane Persian general, Artemisia (Eva Green). Stapleton is not exactly inadequate on the leader role. He showcases a decent performance as the weight of war slowly burdens him, but the brash hawkish lead from Gerard Butler is sorely missed. The movie utilizes almost the same merry band of warriors as 300, despite acknowledging the less superhuman original profession. They might be too similar, especially physique-wise, it feels like a shallow reenactment than legitimate replacement, and it's not about the blue cape instead of red.Eva Green is absurdly filled with anguish, almost excessively. It's very passionately awkward, but admittedly effective nonetheless as she oozes strength at times. King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) gets an exposition of his metamorphosis past, a "before" and "after" look as herbal steroid, magic spell and CG alter his appearance to that of a giant. This retains some of the magical vibe from previous title, although only a mere fragment of it.He does not possess the same on-screen threat as he did, currently he's not even the same level as his madly obsessive lady general. Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) serves as narrator, she partakes in only a handful of scenes as the focus shifts away from Sparta. Her voice has weight, although not as poignant as Dilios (David Wenham) in the first movie, who is now relegated into a flimsy support role.The trademark fight scenes are splendid, stylishly choreographed with elegant brute force. Maritime warfare presents more effects added into bloody skirmish, be it may water or fire, they are visually delightful. It moves very aggressively, slowing at just the right critical moments. In a sense, it almost resembles a game; I wouldn't be surprise if it has health meter and death count display. This mix of battle macabre and CGI stand tall in the peak of action genre, audience will most likely find no disappointment in this regard.Unfortunately, screenplays aren't constructed concisely enough; they don't continue momentum from plot to action smoothly, making some occasions feel dry. It offers some degree of political and social aspect, but not carrying the depth needed to stimulate the audience. While the spectacle is undeniably impressive, 300: Rise of an Empire is just a glorified war movie.

Many people believe that praising this movie supports bigotry against Iranian (Persian) people. The movie has been criticized for making racism into entertainment and the author of the story makes no bones about where he stands on Iranians, Arabs and people of Middle Eastern descent. Here's what Frank Miller, the writer of this movie has to say about Middle Eastern culture. These are his words: "Muslims represent 6th century barbarism. These people saw people's heads off, they enslave women, they genetically mutilate their daughters. They do not behave by cultural norms that are sensible to us. I am speaking into a microphone that never could have been a product of their culture. And I'm living in a city where 3000 of my neighbors were killed by thieves of airplanes they never could've built. Muslims are our common foe." -Frank Miller Source: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yelsk-GNos

First of all this is not a sequel or prequel of 300, most of the events take place along with the battle of Thermopylae of 300, so its basically in the same time frame. the story begins with the Battle of Marathon and concludes with the Battle of Salamis. In this installment we get to see why and how Xerxes becomes the god king; how Artemesia, his naval commander leads the naval force against the Athenians and its consequences. Like its predecessors there is enough graphic violence, blood and gore. The 3D effects have been well utilized and the slow motion sequences added the extra oomph. Great movie to watch but the only thing that was missing was the uniqueness. Movies like Jurassic park, Matrix n 300 were all ground breaking movies in different manner and there immense success was the outcome of portraying something new and unique which were quite not archived by there sequels. I would love to give it 7/10

Just watched it. I am Greek and teachers were busting our b...., about ancient Greece. I don't have an idea about ancient history and i don't care. I haven't read the comics and i didn't like 300. It was overblown and lost me in the middle of an endless fight with the same things over and over again. But this sequel, is the real deal. It is simpler. The fight scenes are tighter and punchier. Instead of giving a huge 100 minute battle, they divided it into 3 major battles. In between a minor back-story took place, which gave me breathing space and a lighter tone in the plot. Coming to the second best element of the movie: it is goofier than ever. Rise of an empire is not ashamed of its clichés. The actor lines are heard a gazillion times before in epic movies, so they keep them restrained. Less is more in this department. They speak when they have to and when they do, you either feel it or laugh with it. Yes, it is funnier. There is nothing wrong with a sex scene in an epic movie, there nothing wrong in a joke here and there, it is a Hollywood movie and a comic so you are supposed to laugh a little. Or a lot, in my case! Finally, it is totally and uncontrollably (in the end) entertaining. Yes i laughed, i sat with agony in my seat to see where this all goes to, i felt chills and this emotion in my gut (the same in every good epic story) and i watched in awe some of the best battle scenes i have ever saw. Instead of dismissing it for another epic movie, go and have some fun. And fall in love with Eva Green ;-)

The film is based as a backdrop to the original 300 storyline and paves a wave for the next part in the franchise but all the way it just drained the legacy of 300. The hero gives uninspiring talks with beats in the background score rising to make the army automatically charged up to start fighting and die... its very nonsensical just like Themistokles saying " Today is the day we water the plants" and with rising music the army responds hu rahhh and they get into the battle. Zack Snyder after delivering the man of steel just seems to have treated this franchise as a step son by doing the screenplay but giving away the direction at Murro's hands who just couldn't pull it off. The casting of suvillian stapleton as a lead actor who clearly fumbles in dialogue delivery and acting was the biggest stupidity. The only silver lining was Eva Green and she delivered right on the money as expected with lena heady who just has a few scenes. guess people will just have to watch this part hoping something better will come in the third. So in all a disappointing experience for one of the awaited films in my list of 2014.

Yes, Leonidas is dead. Yes, the previous movie had a better hero, BUT the new movie has something that the previous one lacked: a violent, bloody and delicious female villain.Yes, Eva Green ( should be called Eva Gore, after seeing this movie ) is perfect. Her character Artemisia gets developed well enough to make you care about her. She has charisma, she puts enemies in their places, she is deadly.The battles are really well done, even though most of them happened in the water. If you played God of War, you'll notice by the end of the movie, that there are angles really similar to the game. Themistokles fights enemies while Artemisia watches everything. The camera doesn't cut away and it focus on the characters. It's violent, bloody, fast and straight to the point. If you're expecting more than that, then this is not the movie for you.The weak point is the ending, but then again, I'm surprised with a sequel that manages to be cool even after being released 8 years after the original. Go watch it!

This movie, being a sequel-prequel thing of the movie 300, was actually better than I had expected. The battle scenes were shot brilliantly (although there might have been a little bit more blood than it should have been) and most of the time had me on the edge of my seat. The flaw of the movie was the storyline. On many occasions it had me thinking how the hell could that have happened. A few dozen Greek ships attacked the naval fleet of the Persian empire (which was composed of a thousand or so ships)and seemingly never lost a single ship whereas the Persian empire lost forty to fifty ships every battle. These aspects of the movie was exaggerated grossly compared to the real battles that commenced between the Greeks and the Persian empire. Another illogical scene that caught my eye in the movie was the sex scene between Themistokles and Artemisia. It simply made no sense whatsoever. Why would the commander of the Greek forces just go and sleep with one of their biggest enemies and the commander of the naval fleet just be down for that? That just didn't make any sense and in my opinion was just put there so there could be a sex scene in the movie, which let's be honest a lot of viewers would enjoy. Nevertheless the movie was an entertaining movie and I never got bored while watching. Would recommend it to people who want to see a little bit of sword fighting action and just have fun while watching.

Yes I give this a 9/10. Because it is such an amazingly entertaining movie, and the two hours running time went by in a flash. When you feel that a movie ended too soon, that's when you know that the movie was a fun ride! So...the movie. Six-pack abs, decapitations, buckets of blood, manly dialogue, jaw-dropping battle scenes. Plus a mortal-turned-god and a kick-ass female commander - all of this add up to one heck of a entertainer. You will notice that I do not mention artistic merit as being a factor; that's because there is NONE. And for those of you who are complaining about the lack of historical accuracy...keep in mind, this movie is based on a comic book, not a history textbook.The lead actor Sullivan Stapleton, who plays Greek general Themistokles adds a bit more depth to his character than Gerard Butler did to his rendering of Leonidas. He has more dialogue and exposition, rather than just yelling and grunting. There may be yet potential for him in Hollywood.The lead actress, Eva Green, who plays Artemisia, has probably one of the fiercest action female roles I have ever seen. No wai-fu here. She portrays her character as one of utter cruelty, yet cold and calculating. Physically too, she is very believable as a woman commanding a fleet of 10,000 men.More than the actors, or the wafer-thin storyline, it is the incredible CGI that keeps you entranced. The battle scenes are probably the best I have seen - the sheer size and scope of the ships, together with the raw savagery of war, is enough to make you a believer! The battle scenes on land as well as on sea have been created with a keen eye for detail, and for maximum impact. Of course, the 3D doesn't hurt.I haven't mentioned the other actors since none really made an impact - not even the golden-hued Xerxes, played by Rodrigo Santoro. His awkward gait, odd voice, and lack of anything to really do in the movie, made him a real disappointment. Queen Gorgo, played by Lena Headey, also suffered from having nothing to do, other than saying "no" in various tones on various occasions.In summary, a fun movie to watch; it's not going to win any Oscars; and yes, there will be a sequel to this sidequel.

War epics and action films in general got a shock treatment and a new face when King Leonidas and his brave 300 took the field in 2006. Sleek action scenes, bloody violence and some hard bodied warriors were painting the hot gates of Sparta with the blood of the invincible Persian army of Xerxes. One can go on for hours, talking about the magnanimous scale of the film, just to underline the fact how its sequel fell short on many levels. Technically the film is the second instalment than a sequel, as the story is now told from a simultaneous angle on the same time-line as the first.When you are trying to add more to a classic, make sure that you at least match the levels, if not out do it. '300, Rise of an Empire' felt like a TV movie when compared to its cult predecessor. First thing they got wrong is the casting. The actor who was chosen to carry forward the legacy of Gerard Butler's King Leonidas, should have been a huge name or at least a charismatic natural with deep strong voice. Sullivan Stapleton was simply no match for that. Eva Green tried her best to bring fear into Artemisia, but at no point did she look like killing Themistokles. One character who managed to outperform from the first part was Lena Headey, who took Queen Gorgo to bigger heights than seen in '300'. We knew she was manipulative, but her will power and slick skills with her husband's sword was a surprise and a good one at that. The chill and thrills from the action scenes was the most impressive element in the original '300', every action scene was fresh, bloody and brutal. Its successor could only provide those thrills in a few scenes, which can actually be counted using your fingers. Its Failure, plain and simple. "We will rather die on our feet than live on our knees". When Themistokles said this line, I added one to the count of good and memorable dialogues in the film and then I stopped counting. That was it. But I can think of a thousand lines from '300' which was well written and powerful. The simple line, "This is Sparta" when King Leonidas kicks the Persian messenger to the death well still gives me goose bumps. Do you want to relive that moment again? I know that we can watch that scene over and over again.In short, '300:Rise of an Empire' looked amateur considering that fact that some of the TV productions are done with more venom and precision. I thought of a 4/10, but there is nothing that is new in the film, so I am going with a lousy 3/10. Watch it for the constructive criticism, but not for the thrills.

300: Rise of an Empire was a really good movie but it failed to deliver on the epicness of the first film. But I'll first touch on the positives. The visuals are really, REALLY cool. It seemed like the blood spurts weren't done quite as well as the first one but overall the visuals in this movie were fantastic. Whether it was Artemisia igniting the Greek Navy or Themistokles leading the Greek forces, the special effects and visuals were a definitely strength. The acting was also really good. Was it "Oscar-worthy"? No but it's a different kind of movie. I thought the actors delivered their roles well, especially Eva Green, who I thought stole the movie. Her beauty is stunning, sure, but she did an incredible job with Artemisia. The plot also developed well and I thought they connected it to the first film really well. Instead of this being a sequel, though, it's essentially occurring at the same time as the first movie, just at a different location. That being said, that is also one of the elements that hurt the movie, in my humble opinion. The movie builds and builds and builds and then right when you think you're about to get the biggest battle of the film, it ends. That is just a part of what I consider the weakest area of the movie... there just isn't enough combat. The first movie was littered with epic fight sequences while this one focused more on the politics. I think they forgot why so many people loved the first one. It was different from the Troys and the Bravehearts and the Gladiators. It was in your face war and had a charm and joy to it. This movie, while good in its own right, lost a lot of that charm and joy and tried to take a more serious cinematic approach, ultimately missing its mark in the process.

First of all, I am Greek. Not only this, but I know really well the ancient history of my homeland.The 300 franchise is based on a comic. It is really that clear! So I can't and shouldn't evaluate 300 as a historic movie. All of you foreigners that evaluate it as such, please stop it! You don't have the right, you don't know our ancient history. Stop.The movie itself as a spectacle is fantastic and as good as the 1st movie of 2006.It has some historic references (names, locations etc), but it is clearly an epic comic transfer to the big screen. As such it has almost nothing more to do with history.Violence, blood, gore, sex, darkness! I love the aesthetics.

As I loved The 300, I expected a fascinating mix of action, pathos and inspired history in this sequel. What I received was an uninspired, pathetic and unmoving piece of non-history. The bright spot was Artemisia's portrayal; what was, frankly, boring was the meaningless violence. Meaningless, because the viewer was given no reason to care for the main character, Themistokles, nor for Athens, nor for the Greeks as a whole. The back stories for why both Artemisia and Xerxes turned vengeful were compelling. (Though, as a PhD historian, I can attest they are both ludicrously false.) But for the Greeks, there simply is no backstory, no reason to care for them at all. "Oh, Athens is burning, ... meh." What is worse, the actual history could have given a plot that the film sorely lacked -- a tiny, terrified democracy is convinced, by free speech and a weird prophecy, to allow itself to be physically destroyed. Then the Greeks allow all to ride on Themistokles' desperate gamble, to trick the Persian fleet into attacking them in the straights of Salamis. (By the way, Artemisia actually tries to convince Xerxes to NOT send the fleet in.) The film gives us no portrayal of Athens, democracy, weird prophecies, or Themistokles' true brilliance. Nor does it reveal that the nascent Western world was balanced on a knife edge. Instead, we are expected to believe that a horse and Sparta come to the rescue. Pathos has become simply pathetic. Not even Ozzy's excellent "War Pigs" could keep people seated during the credits.

300: Rise of an Empire is not really a sequel of the actual 300 movie. It's most a sort of parallel event, happening while the movie is taking place. A Greek general Themistocles leads the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia, vengeful commander of the Persian navy. I wasn't a huge fan of the first movie, but I found it visually groundbreaking. Queen Gorgo is telling the story this time around, it's an opportunity to revisit and reliving the character of this strong but not very known Queen in the 300 movie. She actually embodies the bridge between past and present events. There a few female characters again this time (obvious for an Action-Drama-War movie) but they're very strong, and most importantly very interesting characters. In fact warriors still fight for a Glorious death. My favourite character is Artemisia, starring Eva Green. She's not a one dimensional character, which could have been the danger here. Along the film we're able to discover her back story, which is quiet rare - to see where the characters come from, especially in those films. Moreover, Artemisia's back story kind of ad some humanity to her. Indeed, she was wounded mentally and physically, when she was a child her family got killed by Greeks. Now, we can understand why she's on a mission to revenge her family and killed Greeks boldly. On the other hand, the war hero: Themistocles, is a little bit boring. But he delivers good battle speeches and good action scenes though. The visual effects are stunning, epic, ambitious and still breathtaking. The slow-motion depicts battle scenes quiet like moving paintings on an even greater scale because of the main challenging components such as being on water or costumes. This "sequel" is done with just about as much skills as the first 300 movie. Finally, I was hold at the same feeling of the 300 movie but it shows a new angle which displays that the Greeks are doing their own thing (till Queen Gorgo and Sparta's navy come save them btw). Not so great hero but a very good female villain character.

I really detested the opening credits sequence. It was lovely as a music video, but I was thinking "Bond" the entire time. It didn't fit the theme of the story at all and I was baffled by it. The movie was excellent though. Lisbeth was played beautifully by Rooney Mara, maybe showing a little too much emotion on occasion, but nothing unforgivable. Daniel Craig was great as Blomkvist. The only thing I was particularly annoyed about was that they changed the entire conclusion to the missing girl - where, how, who, etc. It seemed like a stupid thing to do considering the rest of the story being so true to the book. It breaks my heart to say, but I felt like Reznor's score occasionally became intrusive and out of place. Though it was also really good at times.Overall: I enjoyed it and am looking forward to the next two films in the series.

Not long out of a screening and I am still thinking about this English language version of the mega popular Swedish Millennium films GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNETS NEST derived from the brilliant bestsellers. Purists may be up in arms, but think outside the box, what I witnessed was an almost perfect movie.It does, however, have an ending that will divide the audience, different from the foreign version but good enough for me to want to see the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN. Anyhow all I will say is you will not be bored in the 2.5 hrs of grim proceedings. Daniel Craig is a perfect choice as the journalist Mikael Blomkvist disgraced for libel but takes on a memoir writing case to escape, only to be drawn into a web of secrets and family weirdness. His new partner is all the talk and so she should be. Rooney Mara I predicted big things from the second I saw her in Youth in Revolt and she carried the otherwise ordinary Elm Street remake long before her cameo in Social Network. She's also very good looking, holds her poise, strikes like a cobra and walks with complexities unknown to the common man. Christopher Plummer, Steven Berkoff and Robin Wright are unique fillers on screen but not as effective as the great Stellan Skarsgard who is despicable to the point of exhaustion. Mara is a standout as the tough motorcycle riding computer hacker with a actual heart, Lisbeth Salander. Magnificent shock tactics are not overblown as Lisbeth carries out proceedings on a dark missing persons case. Original scenes have been lifted from the source, but tweaked. The music is a standout, typical Direction magic from David Fincher seals the deal to make thus unmissable. GIVE ROONEY MARA an Oscar nomination please, she engulfs Salander as did Noomi Rapace.

While still a great movie (of course, it comes from a great novel) I just don't get it...why was it necessary to make this movie??? They can say they didn't copy the original movie, only the book, but there is no way - the two are pretty much identical! (apart from the ending, but then - why change only that?) It annoys me that there seems to be so many people out there who didn't see the Swedish films, because they aren't "pretty" American movies that they had to make a whole other movie...The original is gritty and disturbing and dark, as the books are, and thats exactly perfect! I would recommend to read the books first at the very least, don't only see the Hollywood version.This is an 8, but the original is a full 10!

Chilling, haunting and relentlessly thrilling, director David Fincher has created the definitive film adaptation of Larssons best seller whilst at the same time improving on the source material. A brilliant performance from Rooney Mara only elevates the film to greater heights The Review:Ill cut to the chase: this is everything fans of the books could have hoped for, its miles better than the already good Swedish film, its more faithful to the novel, in some places it actually improves on the source material.With "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo" David Fincher has put his trademark darkness to fantastic use. Whether its sweeping shots of freezing, snow covered Sweden or wonderfully eerie interiors Fincher creates an unsettling atmosphere that is unrelenting and technically perfect. With Fincher i've learnt to expect a beautifully shot film and this is no exception, within this film are some of his greatest images. Regarding the disturbing nature of some scenes, Fincher is wise enough to show them in all their horror but doesn't stop to linger or exploit.The performances are perfect all round, Its clear Fincher and the casting production went to great lengths to pick not only great actors but those who embody the very essence of their characters. Of note in the supporting characters are Yorick van Wageningen who plays the sadistic Bjurman with unsettling believability and the always great Christopher plummer who is note-perfect as the desperate, loney grandfather Henrik .- As one part of our central duo Daniel Craig puts in his finest performance, normally cast as the tough hero Craig is more subdued here, he has Blomkvist easy charm down to a T but also captures the weak, submissive aspect of his character. - Lisbeth Salander is a character unlike anything fiction has ever seen.broken,pierced, clade in leather with short black hair and a body so slight the wind could break her, she is horribly victimised but refuses to be one. To sum it up she is one of the most interesting and difficult characters an actress could ever play. I could honestly write a whole review on the brilliance of Rooney Mara's performance, she is the very essence of Lisbethas if the character just walked off the page. Mara commands every scene with a mixture of silent burning rage and a deep rooted venerability. Her eyes are the heart of the film, her reactions are the reason myself and the others around me laughed, gasped and even cried. The character requires an actress who can internalize her emotions yet at the same time convay a wide range of feelings. Mara does this such perfect skill, every glance is charged with deep feeling as if you're looking directly into her soul. A brave performance, Mara bares all in the nude scenes and goes to frankly horribly dark places in the now informous scenes of sexual violence. Watching Rooney Mara is witnessing the birth of a star, this is the best performance of the year and if the Oscars fail to reconzie her i will lose all hope in their judgment. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is perfect, eerie and unsettling. It is as good as their Oscar winning score last year if not better, its more understated and does what every score should do....improves the scenes not overpower them.This is by and large a perfect adaptation, my main issue lay with one singe sequence. There is a shot that seems to be there solely for the purpose of showing off, it serves no real purpose within the story. The most touching scenes of the film come from the characters themselves, this is a character driven story and none are more powerful than Lisbeth and Mikeal themselves. Fincher makes their relationship the focus and it pays off, they are the heart of the books and Fincher rightfully recognises this. Proving that sometimes "american" adaptations can actually be for the better this is a film nobody should miss...its everything the novel is, plus some. More than anything i was impressed by the humour that is added through-out, this film will make you laugh, it will break your heart and it will make you want to take a shower.

Anyone who knows David Finchers work knows he is one of the most creative and talented directors of this generation. He blew everyones mind with his adaption of 'Fight Club' almost 15 years ago, and again with his masterpiece of a film 'Se7en'. Speaking of Se7en, this is probably Finchers best effort since that film. All of his movies are amazing in their own respect, but this one will be one of the films that everyone will remember him for. The opening titles use Trent Reznors(amazing man from the one man band Nine Inch Nails)reinvented version of Led Zeppelins 'Immigrant Song' with Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer on vocals (I think?). This will remind many people of Se7ens creepy beginning. One more comparison to Se7en, is the forensic CSI type detective work done throughout the film. Truly a great homage to himself.Now like many have said, this is not a remake. This is an adaption of a book. I kind of dislike when people get those two mixed up. If I adapted Bram Stokers Dracula into a film, would it be a remake of the hundreds of previous Dracula movie attempts? I digress.David Finchers version sticks closer to the novel than the Swedish version did. I do however love the Swedish version and didn't think I would love an American version more, which I do. There were only two American directors I would have voted for the job, and they were David Fincher or Christopher Nolan.Now for everyone thinking this is a Hollywood adaption and that all of the rawness of the Swedish version is toned down then they couldn't be more wrong. This is at times more raunchy and sadistic than the Swedish version. It is even slightly longer since it incorporates more from the book. There are more sex scenes (for the people who didn't read the book and like that kind of thing in a movie). There is a lot of detailed smart and important dialog. Most of the film relies on the talking and conversations between the characters. Many will find this boring, but dare I compare it to Se7en again? Yeah its like that. The actors and actresses do a nice job and are all believable. Daniel Craig pulled off the role perfectly. If you think about it, he kinda looks like the actor that played in the Swedish version. Rooney Mara made art with her performance as the now infamous Lisbeth Salander. I didn't think anybody could beat the performance from Noomi Rapace from the Swedish version. Both were amazing but Rooney slightly surpassed Noomis performance. I just hope she can work with it again in the next films of the series. Rooney has already gotten Golden Globe recognition and I hope to see her name at the Oscars. I hope this movie gets recognized with the directing at the Academy too. The visual style of this movie is pure eye candy movie art. The Cinematography is also worth mentioning. Even if you haven't read the book or haven't seen the Swedish version, this film is a near masterpiece.The rape scene is there and it is as vulgar and uncomfortable as ever. It will surely have trouble staying in some theaters because of some of the nastier and darker graphic scenes. The way a lot of the grotesque makes you have to use your imagination is also used. This movie will make you think and hate people that abuse women or any type of helpless human being. Many people will walk out on the abusive scene. It is definitely one of the most graphic scenes being released in wide release in the U.S.All in all, this movie is a great adaption that stays true to the novel and doesn't use gimmicks to make money. It is raw and realistic. I ask that if you haven't read the book and have the spare time that you use it to read the book. I'm not saying to let it get in the way of your life, but it truly is an experience worth it.

Your appreciation and enjoyment for this film mainly comes down to whether you buy into the story or not and whether you are you a fan of the original book (I should probably say books, since this is the first part of a trilogy). Unfortunately my answer to both questions is quite a drastic no: I know I am going to be quite unpopular with this statement, but I've never really fallen in love with the book and I in fact just don't seem to be able to find the appeal for the actual story itself. I find it quite derivative, exploitive, contrived and a bit heavy-handed to be honest. These exact same problems are translated (in fact even enhanced) into both film adaptations. It's probably unfair to draw comparisons with Niels Arden Oplev's 2009 version, but also unavoidable. There are of course similarities, but given the fact that David Fincher is directing, the US version is a lot more slicker and cinematic. It is also closer to the original book in many places, but, as always in condensing it all into a movie, it has lost some of its more polemical thrusts from Larsson's story and some of the details which made the characters so compelling. All for the sake of the actual crime/mystery plot (which let's face it, it's pretty bland for today's standards and brings very little new to the genre). So in the end, not only the film suffers from the same problems of the book but by shrinking it all it has lost some of its more subtle subtext too. I am not really saying anything new here: what works in books doesn't necessarily work movies. For example, the film spends a long time setting up the two main characters who don't meet until a good hour and 20 minutes into the story. And yet despite all this time Daniel Craig's character is just as elusive to the audience as it was at the beginning. That is an ongoing problem with Fincher's movies. His usual cold approach to film-making and detachment from his characters makes it always very hard for anyone to empathise with anyone on the screen. Craig does bring some unexpected charm and a slight sense of humour to his character (something which was completely absent in the previous version), but it's really not enough to make you care for his character, let alone for making you want to watch him again for the next couple of sequels (Fincher has recently announced his interest to direct both sequels back to back But no official announcement will be made until this one get released, of course). It's Rooney Mara who really steals the show here (well, let face it, so did Noomi Rapace in the previous version. It's a great part to play!). This is one of the performances of the year and there will certainly be nominations and awards for her coming left and right over the next few months. She even manages bring a certain realism to an otherwise over-the-top character by convey both fragility and an incredible strength, sometimes with pure simple looks. However, did we really need that 1 hour and 20 minutes of preparation before these two characters meet? Did we really need to see the infamous rape scene? Yes of course, it's that rape that gives her the motivation for wanting to solve the crime, but why couldn't they just convey that with a quick flashback? Why was the audience allowed inside that room watching not only the rape but also her revenge to her rapist? Wouldn't it have been just as effective and less exploitive if we had been left outside the door, maybe listening to the screams? The problem is, if you take all that preamble out of the equation, you're actually left with very little else because let's face it, as a mystery this is a fairly derivative film. As I said, these are all queries with the book and the story itself . Given the material Fincher has probably down the best he could. This is a handsome film, with some solid acting (Plummer once again is at his best!) but in the end you're left with a sense of "so what?". I couldn't help feeling that everything that Fincher did in this film, he had already done it before. The dark tones of Se7en, the seedy and multi-layered atmosphere of Zodiac, the dark ominous music (if we can call it that) by Trent Reznor from The Social Network. Finally it's probably worth mentioning the impressive "James Bondesque" title sequence (again, Fincher has down beautiful title sequences before) to the notes of the cover version of "Immigrant Song" by Led Zeppelin which I found absolutely mesmerising and yet somehow seemed to belong to a different film altogether. In the end this film adds very little to the previous version, aside from giving us the wonderful Rooney Mara, and certainly adds nothing to what I already know about David Fincher. I just look forward to seeing him handling a script and a story worth of his craft, because I do believe he's one of the best directors out there right now Moviegeekblog.com

Right from the start of this films opening titles, I was taken back to when I had first watched 'Fight Club'. The opening title sequence for this film was even more exhilarating to watch than that of the one opening for Fight Club. The rest of the film was a journey into the greatness that has made Fincher films almost a household name by now. It is easy to say that this was better than the Swedish version of this film, and partly thanks to the performance by Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. I can't say that I have ever been more attracted to a character on film than in this one. Even though, she is quite the bad-ass and about as tomboy as they come, I couldn't help but be engaged by every scene she was in. On another note, this is not an easy film to watch. It does contain a scene of rape and a couple acts of sexual assault on top of that. With all these coming together to form something almost as disturbing as the scene from the lesser know film by Gaspar Noe 'Irreversible'. Everything is perfectly shot here as well, and really does have the 'David Fincher' touch, although, this film felt about the least Hollywood-ised of all his pictures. Fans of the Swedish Trilogy will not be let down here. This is about as intense as crime thrillers get, and for those who call this a remake, for them, this is without a doubt the best remake I think I have seen on screen. Nothing falls into place like you think it will, and as the film ends, I felt a knot in my stomach, and wished I could know the character Lisbeth in real life. The score here done by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is again Oscar worthy after winning last year for their work on Finchers other film, 'The Social Network'. It does have similar tones here, but all in all comes out totally fresh in every scene.Overall, this is easily one of the best films of the year. This could have also been easily predicted coming from me, considering my likeness for David Fincher films. Fincher was responsible for me partly coming to love for films back in 1999 with his film 'Fight Club', which took 1/3 of the reason why I came to love movies in the first place (also in there, Stanley Kubricks 'Eyes Wide Shut', and Sam Mendes', 'American Beauty' —all from 1999) and this film shows that Fincher is indeed one of the best filmmakers in the business today.

Everyone had their pick of who they wanted to play the Lisbeth Salander in the American remake if The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, there were slot of really big names and a lot of great actresses who came very close to bagging the role, but Mr Fincher did the right thing and chose a little known actress who had the acting chops to make this difficult role something memorable, it must be said that Rooney Mara is phenomenal in this movie, I would go so far as to say that she out does Noomi Rapace, which is saying slot because she was also amazing in the original.Remakes of foreign films are either hit or miss, sometimes they can change it too much and it is just lame, or sometimes they can stick to closely to the original and it seems kinda pointless, this remake however is pretty much perfect in sticking to the story but bringing it's own little bits and pieces to it that make it different, it's pretty much the exact same storyline and all important scenes are almost identical, it's just the right amount of same and different. Daniel Craig is rather good as Mikael Blomkvist, but he really us no match for scene stealer Mara.Sweden is shown in all it's freezing cold glory and it's presented in an equally inviting and non inviting way, im glad that Fincher decided to keep it set in Sweden and not transfer it to America, it wouldn't have the same vibe if it were any different. Another awesome thing about this film is the epic opening credits, your eyes and ears are attacked by dripping tattoo ink and Miss Karen O's screeching voice, it's truly epic and sets you up for the film you are about to watch.Fans of the original and fans of Fincher will be impressed, it is a worthy remake of an already excellent film but it also stands as a film on it's own. And long live Rooney Mara, she is the pure driving force and Im praying they remake all 3 films as her as that character is acting gold, so tough, so perfectly cast.Check it out.

An open letter to Hollywood - STOP turning popularly artistic foreign movies into your big budgeted box office cash cows! Why? Simply because you have the tendency to flip, add, delete, re-arrange, water down, etc the original material to fit the average American movie-going audience's intelligence and attention span. Case in point, Let The Right One In - a beautiful Swedish movie but horribly re-made into an Americanized version with 30 minutes lopped off.Now you have sunk your greedy hands into another Swedish film - The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Thank the blessed goodness that Stieg Larsson isn't alive to see how you have flipped and watered down his work ...adding WAY too much and leaving out too little than its Swedish version. PLUS you have revealed TOO before its time.*sighs* If you have seen the Swedish original and/or read Larsson's books, SouthSide seriously advises that you stop reading this review now ...or suffer the agony knowing what they have done. If you're currently reading the Millennium book trilogy - stop now. It's not going to help you while viewing the movie. HOWEVER, you haven't read and/or seen the Swedish original - this movie was tailored for you because you wouldn't have a clue as to what was added or subtracted.Sadly this version is missing the mystique behind the disappearance of Harriet Vanger but focuses more on Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara, an okay replacement to Noomi Rapace) and Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig a stale replacement to Michael Nyqvist). The way TGWTDT was filmed you would have thought the writers were studying the cliff note version of Stanley Kubrick's guide to flipping a novel into a movie without the use of a script. The screenplay (by Steven Zaillian) jumps around like a hot Mexican jumping bean snagging bits and pieces from the book thus smashing them together during the beginning that the plot doesn't become fully clear and concise until slowing down at the middle. Even the rape scenes between Bjurman and Salander did not frighten or make this reviewer squeamish (or even arouse her kinky fetish side). They totally missed their mark. There was no subtle seduction from Bjurman over the "vulnerable" Lisbeth ...it played out like some poorly made American porn. And then that's when the many movie mistakes kick in ...like isn't that dragon tattoo suppose to be down her back NOT alongside her left side ...or isn't she suppose to tattoo "I'm a SADISTIC rapist pig" on her guardian Bjurman's chest instead of "I'm a rapist pig"? There are many more but this reviewer shall not reveal them here. Then there's the TWO major mistakes made in which totally changed the outcome of the entire movie far differing from the original Swedish version and Larsson's book.And a word to the dialect coach - please teach your actors (Daniel Craig included) to stick to one accent, please. This reviewer had a hard time distinguishing if Blomkvist was Swedish, British or American or all three at the same time with everyone changing their accents throughout the movie. It felt like watching The Prince of Persia all over again.Trent Reznor, SouthSide believes Nine Inch Nails want their front man back ...asap! You do not have the gift for composing movie music ...you should have taken some lessons from Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman ...or even Chris Carter. Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song?!?! Seriously, dude, what does that classic epic rock song have to do with the movie especially the opening credits (that looked like someone did as a Graphic Design project for Flashpoint Academy ...and it wasn't even good). The music throughout the movie didn't enhance or heighten the action or plot ...sometimes it was too loud and boisterous or the scene didn't call for music. OR sometimes there was no music to be had when it called for it.*sighs* It is this reviewer's honest recommendation - wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray version. At least you can press stop and then play when you get to a confusing scene that doesn't make any sense.

Let me preface this by saying that I haven't yet read the books or seen the original Swedish films. I will have a full review of this version as it compares to the original films soon.David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network) put together a tight and suspenseful film. I thought the acting was great, specifically from Rooney Mara who plays "the girl". She is phenomenal and one of the sexiest characters I've seen on screen this year. Daniel Craig was good, but didn't blow me away. He was still James Bond, but now with reading glasses. The pacing and script were wonderful, but I thought Fincher foreshadowed the ending and also felt that they should have re-arranged the conclusions a bit. There were a few story lines that came to a close at different times.....so when one ended you still had a couple more to get through. Unfortunately the first story line that comes to a close is the most intense one so the remaining time is kind of "meh" to the viewer since they invested so much emotion in the first storyline. Hope that makes sense. It was a great movie, but if you've seen the originals you may want to wait until this one goes to DVD/br. Full review to come.

First of all, why does Daniel Craig keep his British accent while everyone else in the movie does a Swedish accent? This gives the movie an Englishman in Sweden feel, instead of a wholly Swedish story feel. Maybe Daniel Craig got dropped into the movie at the last minute and maybe for that reason also, he never manages to quite capture Blomkvist properly, he's not the tired, financially ruined reporter whose career has just been destroyed escaping his problems, but he comes off as an strong, athletic, physical presence, headstrong and determined.I admit that I finished reading the book right before seeing the movie and probably for that reason the movie felt more like a PBS re-enactment of the book rather than a feature film. The movie felt like it lacked style and when it did apply style, it felt grossly out of tone. For example, the James Bondesque opening "immigrant song" sequence which seems hardly appropriate for a sleepy murder mystery that aims to explore themes of sexual sadism, Nazism, anti-Semitism etc.The original book is not without its faults, while brilliant in places the author filled in gaps with tripe. Nothing characterizes this more than Lisbeth which the author Larsson made into an Asperger's syndrome inflicted super-intelligent super-human. The movie version of Lisbeth is sexy and cool but cartoonish. There is no effort to elucidate Lisbeth and her actions, she just is cool and smart and that is all we get about her.Having read the book probably puts me in a different category than a large portion of the audience for the movie. While it's never possible to tell a 400-page plus novel in a three hour movie, I really wished for style and focus rather than a quick retelling of the story. It's disappointing that the movie just aims to tell the story rather than take risks and explore themes and ambiances while visually telling the story. Finally as a side note, for those who read the book, the movie version eliminates the Australian sheep station, which leads to a change in the tone of certain characters from the book.

I've never read Stieg Larsson's millennium novels, so I can't say how  faithful this film is to the original material, but I am a big fan of  the Swedish adaptation by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev. Now, I  know the fact that Hollywood is obsessed with remakes annoys the hell  out of us, but I think there can always be room for different  interpretation, different vision and approach and that's what David  Fincher's version excels in. It's more detailed, more curious, and more  unafraid. It's a superb and chilling thriller with an astounding  performance by Rooney Mara. Whether or not this version is better can  be argued but it certainly is a solid film   Rooney Mara, with her skinny body and goth hairstyle and excessive  piercings and tattoos and her attitude, I think Mara manages to give a  more complex Lisbeth Salander than Noomi Rapace's portrayal. But it's  mostly thanks to screenwriter Steven Zaillian who covers information  that the previous adaptation would simply skim or just talk about  instead of exposing it. Fincher and Zaillian want to seriously show how  dark, troubled, but motivated Lisbeth is. And some may consider this  approach to be too brutal or unnecessary but I think it's no more  brutal than Fincher's previous thrillers like Se7en. This is after all,  in its essence, a movie made solely for Fincher's fans or those who are  comfortable with his style. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography work is  fantastic by the way, it plays on how much you can handle. It goes  along with the script that tends to be explanatory. Whatever loopholes  or gaps that the previous adaptation had, Fincher's film fills it and  explains it in its own way.  Lisbeth Salander to me is a rebel, she lives by her own rules, but  she's also by herself, this version wants to instill in her mind the  idea that perhaps she could be sociable or she could be considered  normal if she just gets that attention that she never did, and that's  what warrants a different ending. Mara is absolutely phenomenal as  Lisbeth, it's a defining role for Mara, she's made it her own. She's  fierce, highly driven, but there's a sense of innocence to her as well.  She thinks her anger and actions are justified and the film  successfully encourages us to agree.  All those tattoos and piercings are like 'keep off' or 'stay away'  sign, perhaps because of years of rough background, going from one  guardian to another, so when somebody genuine like Mikael Blomkvist  (Daniel Craig) comes along, he represents the safety that desperately  longs for but would never admit to. I think it's smart that Fincher and  Zailian shows the estranged family side of Blomkvist, they see it as  important for Blomkvist to be able to relate to Henrik Vanger's  (Christopher Plummer) dilemma and I think that's a smart move. Craig is  the weakest link because his accent keeps going on and off, I'm not  sure if he even tries to sound Swedish at all, it's quite the  distraction. But he works with what's given to him, keep in mind that  the title is not Blomkvist with the dragon tattoo.  Of course nowadays you can't talk about Fincher's movies without  talking a bit about the unconventional score by Oscar winners Atticus  Ross and Nine Inch Nail's Trent Reznor. In fact, the movie pays an  amusing homage to NIN. Those of you film score aficionados would  probably find Ross and Reznor's tunes for this film rather eerie and  chilling, which it then pretty much serve its purpose. Having said  that, at times I find the score a bit forceful and it's like the same  soundwave echoing over and over again with the intent to hypnotize. I  don't think the opening graphic credit is all that impressive, it's an  interesting take but it looks out of place, it looks like it should be  a separate music video and it doesn't necessarily introduce the tone of  the film that you're about to see.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is definitely not a movie for the faint  of heart, it's a movie that would rattle your comfort cage, and I think  audiences will be divided, you'll either truly love it, or truly detest  it, but there will hardly be a middle ground.

The Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo offers few surprises for the seasoned viewer of the 2009 Swedish original. Yes, it has come to the point that we can't wait long enough to rip-off foreign markets. To its credit director David Fincher manages to inject the compelling mystery with his auteur pizazz, though the Bond-esque ink laden title sequence may have been overkill.Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a magazine editor on the verge of financial collapse after losing a libel trial. When an assignment appears before him to investigate a murder from 50 years ago, with an enticing offer of the dirt needed to clear his name, he takes it. With the help of an eccentric investigator by the name of Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), Mikael finds himself investigating not one murder but a series.At some point studios are going to figure out that Daniel Craig is not the answer to their casting problems. Here, he's too cool under pressure. I'm no magazine editor, but I don't figure that they handle being kidnapped like James Bond would. He hardly seems bothered.Rooney Mara mutilates her hair and body for this role, receiving more piercing than I'd care to describe. Her accent is highly authentic, more so than Craig's to say the least. I'm not a fan of how she has decided to sell out her body for realism, but Mara does have the most genuine performance of the film.Because of her unorthodox appearance, it can be troublesome for an audience to root for Lisbeth. To accomplish this she's put into a compromising situation involving rape, to which end we can take joy in her revenge. It's an effective tactic, but I question the nature in which she is exploited, making for a largely anti-male narrative. Not only that but The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) makes the same lazy circle as the 2009 film. Random acts of violence happen in the real world, but in a movie the unlikely is frowned upon. When a thief damages Lisbeth's Macbook Pro, she has to see he newly appointed guardian, a sex maniac, and trade services for an allowance to have her computer replaced. So ultimately she ends up back where she started, she had a laptop, and now she has a laptop. This choice makes a nearly 3- hour movie. In fact an entire film goes by before Lisbeth and Mikael meet.The discrepancies between this and the 2009 Swedish films are few until the mystery is solved. As the movie struggles to conclude we find a flashback that has been nixed, replaced by a brief aural tale. Fincher then moves to resolve everything presented in the first half, so Lisbeth becomes a busy girl following up with friends and doing favors.I wasn't crazy about the 2009 film, but I certainly respect it. I can't find myself respecting a blatant cash-in regardless of its individual merits.

"What is hidden in snow, comes forth in the thaw." Swedish proverbThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is indeed a girl's movie, for it is about misogyny and the revenge women can sometimes get. In between is a standard thriller, albeit classy and European, so there's much more investigation than shooting. It's an American product, based on the Swedish film of the same name in 2009, itself based on the Stieg Larsson novels about a wildly eccentric 23 year old woman, Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), who has the investigative skills of Sherlock Holmes and the prowess of La Femme Nikita.Daniel Craig plays a disgraced journalist, Mikael, engaged by a powerful family to answer one of its darkest secrets and at the same time get revenge on his courtroom antagonist, who caused his disgrace. He enjoins Lisbeth to help the investigation.With women the victims in both parts of the story, the investigations have parallel themes of revenge and feminism. Lisbeth is one of the most complicated women ever on screen. Alternately kinky and remote, tough and vulnerable, she also is ultra modern navigating both technology and sex.This iteration has all the plot points of the original and an enhancement of the relationship between journalist and assistant. In the end all is tied up, with an anticlimax that could have been left behind although it is interesting to see how the criminals receive their just rewards.Overall the film is stylish and decidedly brutal (a rape scene is shocking but still watchable) with a cerebral overlay complementing the base acts that include incest and Nazis just in case rape were not enough for the audiences on both sides of the pond. That the American version could so soon after the Swedish compel viewers and stand on its own is a tribute to director David Fincher and novelist Larsson."Evil shall with evil be expelled." Swedish proverb

It can be put short: If you have seen the original Swedish version don't waste your time watching this one.Forget all the talk about "this is not a remake - this is a new adaptation". If you hear or read somebody state that, they only prove they have not seen Arcel & Oplev's version because this American try out is most of all a scene by scene remake - even many of the locations are the same! The pro of Finchers version is the performance of Rooney Mara. It is very close to match Rapaces international breakthrough.The no. 1 con is Finchers total lack of adding anything new or original to this remake. The only major contributions Fincher brings to the table is a fat and slick visual style, and a rude Hollywood simplification of the storyline presented in both the novel and the original movie adaptation.I rate 5/10 - a simplified copy cat of a (only) two years old movie... what a waste!

Why do an English language version of a stunning foreign film? There are all sorts of reasons to do so and good ones. Perhaps the foreign culture got in the way of Americans appreciating the story fully, or perhaps the film was not well distributed in English-language countries. The North American market is huge and there are plenty of dollars for a film that probably played mostly in art houses (e.g. Pour Elle became The Next Three Days--practically duplicates). Tattoo, however, had a robust DVD viewing, so it's not like it lacked exposure. And sometimes a director has a particular point of view that he or she thinks will enhance or illuminate the story -- perfectly reasonable. But I really cannot say why David Fincher took on a redo of this film. He brought nothing new to it. It's a copy tweaked here and there and not near as gritty as the original. And I'm not all that enthusiastic about some of the changes he made in Lisbeth's or Blomquist's character or in the story wrap up. The first hour is quite slow--I even nodded off for a few minutes. It picks up when Lisbeth and Blomquist finally begin working together, although this Lisbeth is somewhat more into Blomquist. Despite Lisbeth's severe goth look, it's not as hard and realistic as Rapace's. Rooney Mara is Hollywood Lisbeth. Rapace has more street cred,she wasn't pretty & looked somewhat boyish. I love David Fincher, think he's one of the best storytellers in film today. But I can't see compelling reasons for his efforts in this film. In any case, you'll enjoy the movie...again. But you won't leave the theatre in shock and awe.

I was really looking forward to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ever since I learned that David Fincher had been attached to it. Now normally I'd be angry at the fact of a foreign film being remade, having seen and loved the Swedish version of the film, but I made an exception with this one because of the cast and crew for this film. Fincher, who directed films such as Fight Club, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, and most recently The Social Network (my favorite film of 2010 and what I thought should have won over The King's Speech), has a fantastic eye for filmmaking and has always impressed me with his movies, save for Se7en which I wasn't as huge a fan of as everyone else was and even on that film I enjoyed a good bit. You throw in the writer of Schindler's List and Gangs Of New York, add actors like Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer and so many others, a score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who also scored The Social Network), and base it off the best selling book by Stieg Larsson (that's right, this isn't a remake but rather a re-adaptation), it all equals out to, in my opinion, the best film of the year by far.Now the first thing I want to say about this movie is Rooney Mara's performance. She knocks it out of the park portraying Lisbeth Salander. She captured the mystery, the strangeness, the darkness, the out-of-the- norm personality that this character had. She was absolutely fantastic and I'm gonna be shocked as hell if she does not get an Oscar nomination. And she really makes you feel for her in the darker parts of this movie, which we'll get to in a moment. And all the other performances are great as well. Daniel Craig is great as usual and there is great chemistry between him and Mara. Christopher Plummer, as little as he's in the movie, does a great job as well, in fact all the actors do. This is a really well acted movie.Another thing that a lot of people have been talking about with this film, as it was with the book and the Swedish film, was the moments where sexual violence appears on screen. And while there are some really uncomfortable moments in the film, that's the reason why these scenes succeed. They shock you and make you want to look away. And that's good, especially when the themes of this movie as well as the source material were about this sort of thing, and the movie conveys it perfectly. And while these scenes do linger in your mind, they never distract you from the basis of this movie, which leads into my next praise for the film.The story is really engaging. Even though I had seen the Swedish movie and knew how the story as a whole was going to play out, I was able to be really engaged in the movie and not focus on other things. It really sucks you in, and Steve Zaillian, the writer of this movie, structures the film in a way that is both similar and different to the Swedish version, therefore doing what I hoped this film would do, which was taking something that I already knew about and had watched before and made it to where it was still interesting and there were changes made to where I didn't know how it was going to turn out. And that's great.And everything technical about this movie succeeds. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is fantastic and really sucks you into the tone of the picture. Jeff Cronenweth, who worked with Fincher on both Fight Club and The Social Network, delivers fantastic cinematography. The editing, the direction, the shots, everything about this movie succeeds, making it a near perfect film.Now one small complaint I have about this film stems a little bit from me viewing the Swedish version, in which they reveal a little more about who Lisbeth is and one of the things she did in her past that made it so troubled. And they didn't use that here which kind of threw me off a little. However, the more I think about it, the less it becomes a concern because 1.) You can't compare the two films and 2.) there are bits and pieces shown in the films climax that shows that Lisbeth deep down does have a soul. So the movie manages to overcome that obstacle, and overall, I have nothing to say bad about it.Overall, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a masterful film, it's one that you should definitely check out and I'll definitely be checking it out sometime soon. It's directed, written, and acted well, and succeeds in all that it sets out to do. You feel the emotion and darkness of the film, Rooney Mara blew me away with her performance (and that body, damn), and overall it lived up to my expectations. So out of ten, I got to be honest, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a 10. Go see this movie NOW.

I've never read the books or seen the original Swedish film but all I can say is that it had a decent story and the acting was superb. David Fincher did a great job molding this piece together. It wasn't terrible but it could of obviously been more. I sat through a 2 hour and 45 minute movie that was fairly slow in pace and very inactive. It had interesting and captivating moments but it really wasn't something to kill over. Honestly, if you have never read the book OR seen the original Swedish film than I can fully say as an audience member you can pass on this one. Wasn't terrible, it wasn't excellent, just a standard film that isn't something I would go crazy over.

Just saw a sneak peek of the film and couldn't recommend it more.When I walked into it I never expected what I got, this is the best adaptation of a novel I've ever seen.Most of the characters themselves capture the essence of Larssons novel perfectly, but Rooney Mara's portrayal of Lisbeth Salander is Oscar-worthy. The woman perfectly captures the dichotomy of the tortured, vulnerable soul with the calculating, sociopathic tendencies embodied by the character.I wouldn't want to reveal anything else, but for fans of the novel and for fans of good film in general, this is a must see.

Greetings again from the darkness. The character of Lisbeth Salander absolutely fascinates me. That's true whether we are discussing Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy novels, the Swedish film versions, or this latest film version from director David Fincher and a screenplay from Steve Zaillian. It's also true whether Lisbeth is played on screen by Noomi Rapace (Swedish films) or Rooney Mara. She is a brilliant character hiding in plain sight from a world that has fiercely mistreated her, and now misjudges and underestimates her. She is the oddest heroine I can recall ... and I can't get enough of her.Let's start with the source material. Stieg Larsson's books are far from perfect, but addictive just the same. The first book (on which this film is based) is, at its core, a simple who-dunnit presented in a manner that is claustrophobic, paranoid and eerie. Moving on to this particular film, we find the director and screenplay holding the basic tone while making a few changes ... some minor, others more substantial. These changes may irk those fans who are a bit more loyal to the books, but Fincher surely wanted to offer more than a simple re-telling of the story.Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist hired to solve the 40 year old mystery of the disappearance/murder of Harriet Vanger, niece to Swedish millionaire Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). To research, Blomkvist must dig into the Vanger's rotten family tree of Nazis, anti-Semites, sexual predators, anti-social fanatics, and a few just plain loony birds. You can imagine how excited this rich and once powerful family is to have someone uncovering long buried secrets. Circumstances allow for Lisbeth to assist Blomkvist in researching this.Unlike many mysteries where assembling the clues is the most fun, the real heart of this story is the odd, somewhat uncomfortable developing relationship between Blomkvist and Lisbeth. This latest version allows this to develop relatively smoothly, but it nonetheless rattles our senses. We see the subtle changes in Lisbeth as she slowly opens up to the idea of a real friendship based on trust. Fear not mystery fans, the Vanger clan still provides more than enough juice to keep any film sleuth happy.It's truly impossible to avoid comparisons between the two movie versions and the respective casts. It's quite obvious Mr. Fincher was working with a substantially greater budget than Niels Arden Opler had for the first Swedish film. While they are both enthralling, I actually lean a bit towards the rawer original. That takes nothing away from this latest version. Same with Noomi Rapace vs. Rooney Mara. Ms. Mara is excellent in her performance and I was fully satisfied, but Ms. Rapace brought a rougher edge to the role ... one that made it even tougher to crack that shell. The biggest difference in the casts is Daniel Craig against Michael Nyqvist. Mr. Craig is just a bit too cool for the role, while Nyqvist captured the insecurity and vulnerability that Larsson wrote about.All of that is nit-picking. Both film versions are sterling entertainment and hopefully the Fincher version will bring the story to a much wider audience. I would encourage those that are interested to check out the Swedish version, as well as the Larsson books. Maybe that will explain my fascination with this creature known as Lisbeth Salander.

David Fincher...Best Director, Rooney Mara...Best Actress, Daniel Craig...Best Actor. Oh yes, and whoever the editor was......Best Editing! From the opening credits, which grabbed me into the mystery to the incredible editing (the movie could have been 4 hours long were it not for the editing) and the incredible story (thank you Mr. Larsson)this is one hell of a movie. I don't think I have had such an experience as this movie gave me....EVER! (and that's saying a lot, because I have been a movie buff all my life, an actor, writer and director) and a play reviewer for the past 5 years. This movie is probably not for everyone, but I suspect, a few million people will. Oh yes, Rooney Mara, I was blown away by her performance!

Loved the movie, and I have read all three books and seen the Swedish versions. As one reviewer already mentioned, I wanted to clear something up: this is not a remake, but an adaptation of the book. People take away different thing from the book, hence why the movies have slight differences. Its fine to like one over the other, but reasons shouldn't be 'it's an American remake.' Both films took away different parts of the book, which on both films, can be disappointing. However, the book is written so in depth that some cuts had to be made. People cannot compare or say how Lisbeth is portrayed between the films without knowing her character in the book. Side note, I could have done without the beginning. A little too stylized for me. However, the performances were brilliant. And the score was great. This movie makes me want to watch seven again.

My wife and I had read all three books, and saw all three Swedish movies. We had been so excited about the new "Hollywood" movie, and went to the Tuesday night first showing. The opening credits, while very unusual and visual, were totally unrelated to the movie. If anything, it was disruptive, and like watching the credits of a James Bond movie. Having watched the sub-titled Swedish movies, we were looking forward to the English version. However, so much of the dialog in this movie is spoken so softly or mumbled, covered with intrusive background music (or noise!), such that we were wishing for sub-titles in this one! Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara have perfected talking without moving one's lips.The story was not nearly as well explained as in the Swedish movies. If one has not read the book, I daresay he will feel very clueless as to what happened to Mikael at the beginning, and will struggle to understand what is happening.Our theater was packed for the opening show. I found it interesting that when it was over, the crowd simply got up and left, without the kind of excited conversations one hears when people have loved the movie. I sense that most of our audience shared our feelings....what was the point of making this movie, when such a wonderful movie had already been done.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is certainly one of the more depressing films of the year, but also one of the most enthralling, hard to turn away from films of the year. It follows Mikael Blomkvist (Craig), a journalist who has just lost everything, and Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a researcher/computer hacker whose life has been nothing but hardship and misunderstanding since her adolescent years. The two converge on a case surrounding one of the more prominent and dirty families in all of Sweden, the Vangers.Henrik Vanger (Plummer) hires Mikael to investigate the disappearance of his niece. He encounters many problems, the biggest being the disappearance happened 40 years ago. When his research starts getting interesting and more dangerous, he calls upon Lisbeth, who did the background check on Mikael for the Vangers. Together the two try to solve the case, digging up hidden truths, dirty secrets, and encountering some detestable characters along the way. They don't know if they're getting close or farther from the truth, but as the heat turns up, it seems like the answer is rapidly approaching, or is it their impending demise?What stands out most about this film from the original Swedish version of a few years ago is the mood. Yes, both films cover some disturbing material, but the original version looks like it was filmed in the real world. Fincher, however, creates an entirely different world. It looks, feels, and almost smells dirty. There is hardly a white light found in the film. Even the snow is turned grey by the overcast skies. You get the feeling that there is no hope for these characters.There is really only one area where the film lacks. Pacing. There is so much information to translate to the audience. It's the job of the editor and the writer to make sure that the audience doesn't skip a beat. There is montage after montage, intercuts, and Swedish writing thrown about that it's hard to keep track of what exactly a character is doing. We get the gist of it all, but there were moments when I was lagging behind just enough to notice.Other than that I thought the film was a fine adaptation for American audiences. I wasn't sure how the sexual violence would be handled, but Fincher doesn't hold back, much like the Swedish film. Is it important that we see this violence? I hate to say it but yes. We need to like Lisbeth so much that we completely disregard her outward appearance and see her as a survivor. She's extremely talented and fearless. Mara brings Lisbeth to life much like Noomi Rapace brought her to life, only Mara is a letter more brazen and less moody than Noomi, but both are effective with what they do. Craig too gives a solid performance. I was worried that they would try to toughen his character up (seeing as Craig is currently James Bond), but they didn't. They make him likable only because he seems normal and one who stands up for what he believes in.It's a slimy, complex, fast-moving thriller that is sure to turn some heads at times but in the end you'll be holding your breath and hoping for the best. You might go into the movie clean, but you'll come out dirty.

Coming into "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo", I had not read the book nor had I seen any of the Swedish movies. However, I had seen almost all of director David Fincher's movies, and I was excited after his last two, "Zodiac" and "The Social Network" thrilled me.However, this movie does not quite live up to those standards. The story, a reworking of Steig Larsson's original book, involves Mikael Blomqvist, a journalist who has recently been found guilty of libel (Daniel Craig) and who is looking to escape the public eye and reinvent himself. Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a sickly old man who lives on an island in northern Sweden, seeks out Mikael's services in an attempt to unravel his family's past and solve a murder.At the same time, Lisbeth Salander's (Rooney Mara) caretaker has recently had a stroke and she is switched to another one, named Bjurman, who repeatedly takes advantage of her when she asks for money. Don't worry, he gets his come-uppins. Eventually, she teams up with Mikael to solve the mystery and his personal life.Mara does the character justice for the most part (although there were times where I thought her tenacity did not match that of the acts she was performing), but I take issue with how her character was presented. Without knowing more about her background, I had trouble caring when bad things happened to her. In addition, the viewer never doubts that she is going to succeed eventually in everything Salander undertakes, and so does not care all that much when bad things happen to her before those successes.I greatly enjoyed Craig portraying a decadent, down-and-out Mikael. His use of deadpan, self-depreciating humor is excellent, although he is occasionally made to look a bit too incompetent in the scenes he shares with Salander. All of Craig's actions, from his incessant coffee-making to the way he sucks on his cigarettes, help create an image of Mikael that the viewer sympathizes with and wants to help. Well done.The main problem with "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo", then is the story. Fincher does his best to gussy it up, with some fantastic shots of Sweden making it seem as if something or someone is always lurking around the corner. Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor do a brilliant job as well, and the use of sound was by far my favorite part of the film. However, neither of these details stops the story from being clunky and a bit bland. After getting almost nowhere for about half the movie, the second Mikael teams up with Salander, suddenly everything seems to fall into place, her incredible Google-search skills teaming with his ability to ask questions leading them to the villain relatively quickly.It would have been quicker, however, if they didn't stop to have sex every two scenes. I have nothing against sex scenes, but this one is so out of the blue and against what Salander's ethical makeup had been up until that point, that the viewer almost feels deceived. It felt as if the movie had to fulfill some sort of heterosexual sex quota, character development and plot be damned!Mikael finds the killer (well, sort of), Martin Vanger (an excellent Stellan Skarsgard), who, in typical bad guy fashion, talks to Mikael instead of murdering him, giving a speech that actually would have been brilliant if he had followed through afterwards. However, the speech gives Salander enough time to solve the mystery on her own and save the day. Woo.Anyway, there is much to like about this movie. The acting is quite good, and there are the usual Fincher-ian touches that make it more than just the average thriller. However, it hits so many pit-falls, both in terms of plot and in terms of characterization, that it is just barely more (than average).

Following the very successful adaptation of Stieg Larssons millennium trilogy into three very successful Swedish language films, it came as no surprise when Hollywood announced that it would be making an English-language version of the series. Director David Fincher was announced to craft the first book in the series, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The new version follows very close to the original material with one fairly big exception which I will detail later in the review.Daniel Craig stars as Mikael Blomkvist, who at the opening of the film has recently lost a court case for which he was being sued for libel by a prominent business figure. His career is in ruins and virtually all of his savings gone as a result of the trial and punitive damages. So when he is contacted by an attorney representing the wealthy and powerful Vanger family, he agrees to meet. Although highly reluctant to take a meeting, Mikael takes the four hour train ride north of Stockholm to a cold and remote island to meet with Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Henrik wishes Mikael to investigate the disappearance of his niece some 40 years earlier, a niece vanished under the families' very noses and not a trace of her has been discovered since. Henrik is convinced that she has met with foul play, yet every year on his birthday, he continues to receive a gift of ornate pressed flowers in an anonymous package.Henrik believes that the killer is haunting him by sending the gifts and that a member of his family may be to blame. Although skeptical of being able to find anything 40 years later, Mikael accepts the case and soon sets up residence in a small cabin on the island and begins his investigation by combing through police reports, conducting interviews, and examining photographs and newspaper clippings. Mikael had been warned that the other members of the Vanger family may not be too thrilled with his presence as not only is the family fractured, they all have their share of secrets. At the same time, a very Goth punk girl named Lisabeth (Rooney Mara), is fighting her own demons. Lisabeth is an extremely gifted computer and surveillance expert who specializes in gathering background information on individuals. As such, her skills have made her in high demand with her employer. Unfortunately, Lisabeth is also a deeply antisocial person who is prone to lash out violently if provoked. Much of this stems from an extremely traumatic childhood spent in institutions which resulted in Lisabeth being placed as a ward of the state, not deemed competent to care for herself. This arrangement requires her to check in on a regular basis with a representative who, unfortunately for her, has recently suffered a stroke and places her in the care of the new guardian.The new guardian subjects Lisabeth to horrific demands just so Lisabeth can access her money. The traumatized Lisabeth does not play victim long and in a twist of fate, is assigned by Henrik's attorney to assist Mikael since she did the background check on him prior to Mikael being approached by Henrik for the investigation. The unlikely duo combined to form a highly efficient pair as they start to piece together the clues which indicate a brutal string of murders leading back for decades. As they work together, the relationship deepens and the reserved Lisabeth starts to come out of her shell. Tension mounts as danger surrounds them in an epic race against time to solve the case that certain members of the family do not want solved.The film runs approximately 2 hours and 45 min and does take a little while to get started as the landscape and back story of the characters is established. The film has some very dark and brutal moments, which are hard to watch, yet were not as graphic as those in the Swedish language version. Craig and Mara work very well with one another and props to Craig for being willing to put on weight and occasionally looked disheveled to enhance his character.Mara gives a masterful performance as the complicated Lisabeth, the anti-damsel-in-distress heroine, who subtly shows the many complicated sides to the character. Noomi Rapace first portrayed the character and has gone on to prominent success in Hollywood with a slew of upcoming high profile films. I would expect nothing less for Mara with two other sequels in this series to film. I am sure this breakout performance will not go unnoticed as it is an extremely difficult and daring role that few in Hollywood would want to tackle, much less be able to pull off as convincingly as she did.I was extremely happy to see that the character names, settings, and situations were not changed in the new version, and it was refreshing to see the film set in Sweden and not relocated to London or New York. The biggest issue I had with the film was with the ending, which deviated from the previous versions. I will not provide spoilers, suffice it to say the resolution was a bit too tidy of a Hollywood ending and in my opinion greatly undermined one of the central characters of the film. That being said the film is a bold and dynamic vision from Fincher and is a deeply dark and disturbing story that is difficult to forget.4.5 stars out of 5

Having read all the books, and watched the Swedish versions of the films, I could not be happier with Fincher's film. It is spot on. That je ne sais quoi of the stunning and the subdued in harmony, that is so difficult to achieve, but so necessary to film like this, is flawlessly executed.I think Reznor was an excellent choice for the soundtrack, and he did a phenomenal job. I never felt as if the music was out of place or intrusive.There are a few story changes, but ultimately they make for a better movie. I'm sorry to have to disagree with those of you who prefer the Swedish films, and think the first Swedish film is better. The cinematography in Oplev's version is excellent, the acting is first rate, but ultimately the film is a disappointment. It is incoherent, and oftentimes jarring. Had I not read the books before watching Oplev's version, I would not have been able to follow it. Fincher's film is nearly perfect. Every change has a purpose and benefits the film.It goes without saying, Rooney Mara is absolutely amazing. But I also thought Daniel Craig was an unexpected, and wonderful, choice. For those who claim Mara outshined him, yes, she did, and no, she didn't. Who is the shocking, scene-stealing, surprising one? Salander? Or Blomkvist? Craig played his part true to the novel. He is a subdued fellow. He is not dramatic. He is never over-the-top. He does not brood. What were you people expecting? Craig was Blomkvist. Had he acted any differently, it would have changed the story, and not for the better.Whether you have read the novels or not, see the film. It will bash you over the head on the one hand, and slowly seep into you on the other. I still can't stop thinking about it.

I must say that I found it hard to believe that anyone would contemplate doing a remake of this movie. I found the original film to be really unique, very much like a Bergman film, in a league of its own. I read all the books and saw all three movies, all of them excellent.The Nordic feel to the movie is right in your face and everything feels really authentic. The actors are all incredible, Rooney Mara & Christopher Plummer in particular. The action is quite fast paced, with very little time to get complacent.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole film, even though I knew what was going to happen more or less. The ending with Harriet is different from the original. Stieg Larrson makes equally fascinating research for anyone who is interested in the man behind the movie. The photographs and all the research material used in the case file are excellent and add to the feel of the movie.

Mikael Blomkvist has been convicted of libel against Wennerström(whose pretty much only perceived as a villain in this, one of the few arguable failures of this) and the fee he has to pay costs him his life savings. So when he is offered a large pay, as well as the inside scoop on his nemesis, he agrees to, in return, try to solve the 40-year-old disappearance case of the daughter of Henrik Vanger, the retiring and dying leader of the concern named after him. The suspects? His entire family. The wealth and power is alluring, after all. He is aided by the Goth hacker, Lisbeth. I didn't think I was going to say this, especially because I loved Rapace's performance, but Rooney Mara *is* Salander. The mannerisms, the anti-social behaviour, the voice, everything, spot-on. This is the far more interesting(and emotionally involving, both her to us and her with others) take on her(like other things in this, it's deeper), such as the clear Asperger's Syndrome aspects to her(not present in the other one). These are not hammered home, they are there and if you know what they are, you'll see them. They come naturally to this, as many other things in this. This is not a remake or Americanization of the Swedish film, it is a fresh adaptation of the novel, and without having read it, even I knew things that that one missed, and they are in this, and this is all the better for it. This is far superior to that one; while not in every single respect, the things where they match or this is lesser are insignificant in amount and/or scope. One negative that is perhaps noteworthy is that not only was this shot where it's set, no, they went the extra mile with Swedish pronounciation and poorly attempted accents, and this is awkward and requires getting used to. This doesn't convey the isolation, however, in its place is the freezing cold. The theme of men of authority who hate women and make them suffer is explored well. This doesn't remove anything that was extreme in the original, rather, it makes them even stronger. It is a brutal, disturbing, sexually perverted tragedy with a moderate amount of swearing. The ending and opening(reminiscent of that of Fight Club) are infinitely greater, and leave an imprint on you. I don't know how, since this isn't much longer, though this definitely fits in a lot more, and has a richness of detail that the '09 one lacks(and while I know that those were meant to be a mini-series, I'd say this is the better approach, separating the installments and not making them all at once). This has a good mystery, if I'm unsure if the hints towards the solution are excessive or not. I recommend this to anyone who might like it(be sure to know what you're in for, this pulls no punches). 10/10

When I first read this book I found it slow going and long. Even after reading half of it I didn't like the confusion or the slow pace. At 3/4 I began to like it and by the time I finished it had grown on me. Although not a well written book it was filled with detail that a movie maker could use to craft what they wanted into the picture. When I saw the Swedish film I was really impressed. It was a little confusing but much better than the book. The photography was interesting and bright and helped to let the viewer focus on the complex plot. The acting was really good and it was surprising that none of the characters were particularly attractive. I expected the English version to be much less realistic and it was but that's OK. We imagine ourselves as the characters and are used to Hollywood. The shocking scenes of nudity, homosexuality, rape, sadism, bondage and torture are brutal and I'm not sure if this isn't the most shocking to the sensibilities of any movie I've seen in my life. It stays with you long after you watch it and doesn't make me want to go visit Sweden anytime soon. I'll never think of it as the land of Elke Summer again. On the plus side I was really amazed at the quality of acting, photography, editing and overall movie-making in the Swedish film. It's not just at the top of foreign films it is comparable to any non special effect American movie. The American version I expected to be even better. I thought it would show the superior expertise of writers here portraying the complex plot in a more understandable manner. I thought there would be more effort shown with the pace of the movie and all the areas that we excel in because of the huge sums of money we put into our films. After all they were copying not only a best selling book but the most successful movie ever made in Sweden. How could it help but be better. Unfortunately I was wrong on all counts. This should have been a piece of cake. They weren't working from a book but already had a very good movie to work from. It seems like the worst they could do was just dub it in English and reap millions. Instead they started with a Terminator beginning like a James Bond movie, completely out of place and inexplicable. Then they get a director of dark, scary movies to create a dark mood with DARK visuals to make everything hard to see and understand. Sure don't need that with a complex plot. The music seemed out of place also. You don't need all this scary stuff when the story is absolutely frightening without it and when the contrast of bright clarity and horrible actions is much more shocking. A word about the characters. Daniel Craig looks a lot like the Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist except without the bad skin. Both were very good actors. The Girl Lizbeth (Noomi Rapace) was excellent. Going in everyone knew this was an Academy Award part besides being a three film role. What actress wouldn't want this role? And Mara Rooney also did a great job EXCEPT - now maybe I'm just getting old but they had her whisper stuff and mumble things and I absolutely couldn't hear or understand them. In a movie that has such incredible suspense you don't want to be asking the person next to you in the theater what the hell she said.Don't get me wrong. I like this movie. It was frightening. It was shocking. It was consequently REALLY memorable. But what an opportunity lost. I can't imagine how it could be easier to make a movie when all you have to do is copy a great one, make it in English, and improve on the weak points. Unfortunately it's sort of like they remade Pride and Prejudice with John Woo directing, and used rap music. The movie is a "B" that will get treated as an "A" because of the subject matter of abuse of women and how graphic the scenes of sexual abuse are. Rooney will receive awards, etc. But oh, what it could have been. If you like this movie, which you will, get the Swedish version. You'll like it better.

As soon as the Stieg Larsson movement made its way to North America, me being a pop culture junkie, I was intrigued. But I hate to read. Lucky for me, of course, the three books in the trilogy had already been made into feature films in Sweden, and thus, I saw them all. And to be quite frank, I didn't really understand what all the fuss was about, as made evident by my reviews of the first three films. The story seemed choppy, convoluted and the films were far too long and seemed to drag forever.I understand now that I think a fair amount was simply lost in translationor missed due to reading sub-titled."The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" has now been remade by an American filmmaker. Although usually the kiss of death right there, well, um.Not this time.As soon as I heard there was to be a remake, I sorta cringed at the thought, but once I saw the Swedish version, I couldn't help but think it could be improved upon considerably. And the story would be much easier to follow in, you know, English. When I found out the man behind the film was going to be David Fincher , however, I couldn't imagine a remake not being anything less than exquisite. With works of brilliance like "Seven," "Zodiac," and his Oscar-nominated "The Social Network" under his belt, this film couldn't have possibly been anything less than electrifying.And I was right. Right from his signature, breathtaking opening credits.There were a lot of things about the story I had a hard time keeping track of the first time around, but I remember the film. And what Fincher managed to do was nothing short of beautiful. Staying very true to the original film, but flushing out what I can only imagine to be some of the more subtle details of the book, he has made a much more uniform film.The incredibly talented (and stunning) Daniel Craig takes over the role of Mickael Blomkvist, a discredited journalist who is hired by a wealthy patriarch to try to solve the murder of his niece forty years prior. Aided by a brilliant but troubled researcher, Lisbeth Salander, they uncover corruption that goes far beyond what they expected to find.Craig's performance is nothing short of perfect, but Rooney Mara's transformation into Lisbeth is nothing short of extraordinary. Last seen in a small role in "The Social Network," the actress is almost unrecognizable as she executes the troubled character with such precision, watching her on screen is like a moving work of art, both painful and graceful. Having just captured a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, I would be hard pressed to imagine that her nomination won't translate into one for an Academy Award as well. A nomination that I think she could have a serious shot of winning, despite the obvious upcoming inclusion of some woman with the last name of Streep.And although the rest of the supporting cast is made up of excellent performances by the likes of Oscar-nominated Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright and a surprisingly strong showing for an unexpected Joely Richardson ("Nip/Tuck"), the real artist here is, once again, Fincher himself. Going against everything most American directors attempt, Fincher did not try to Americanize the film in any way. There was worry that he might water it down or make it more Hollywood-friendly but the end result is, in fact, a film that is even more violent, more distressing, and even more sexually charged than the Swedish attempt. No corners were cut, no locations were changed, no smoothing anything over to avoid an R rating. With just a slight alteration for a more cohesive ending (no idea if this ending is not in the book, or the original films ending is), Fincher managed to make the film I completely expected him to make. And then some.Yes, the film does indeed run a little long, as did the original, but with so much intrigue and twists and turns, it doesn't run so long to make you check the time. It simply manages to tell an excellent story of familial corruption, while conveying the true, intense, incredible hardships of a heartbreakingly beautiful and intelligent but violent woman who has covered up her pain in makeup and hairspray. And tattoos.

Just to be quick and get it out of the way, Rooney Mara did an outstanding job as Salander. She surpassed my expectations and put any doubts I may have had about her to rest. She did a better job than Noomi Rapace and Rapace delivered an incredible performance to begin with. She definitely deserves the academy awards best actress nominee if not the award itself because she carries that movie from start to finish and it was breathtaking to see her do a complete 180 from her earlier roles. She is not playing Lisbeth Salander, but rather, she is Lisbeth Salander. Despite minor discrepancies from the book's plot, the changes that were made worked if and only if you are not a picky fan that cannot have anything changed at all. I will admit the first half hour is a little slow especially to the general audience but that does not detract from the rest of the movie. Being in a full theater, everyone gasped, clapped, cheered, laughed, and even cried at all the pivotal points of the story. Everyone I have talked to and based on people's reactions in the theater, they all felt attached to Salander which again reinforces my best actress winner.Go watch this movie because it truly is "the feel bad movie of Christmas"

For starters, why did they have remake this one? I would have loved to see the reactions to a remake of "Casablanca" in 1945, or what about "Gone With The Wind" with another beautiful actress who lacked the fire Leigh brought to the role. Could I even picture "Titanic" with another Kate? There was something iconic about the way Rapace's performance in the original "Dragon". She raised the bar to the point she might never be able to match the complexity of that performance, an organic, complete, involving role that consumed her and hypnotized the audience. The new film tries very hard to recreate the experience, and it does a decent job in some aspects, but the first film was more than just a performance. It emanated from troubled relationships, from flawed nature, from the way expectations were toppled one after another. In the recent film, changing the ending doesn't quite work; in fact, it hurts the film quite a bit. There are some very good elements in the new film, especially the score, something that permeates the film with much needed energy, and there is something fresh about the way some of the scenes were opened up, particularly near the end. However, it is what has been done to the main character that is painful to watch. In the novel and the first film our protagonist has a troubled background. It interferes with the way she develops her relationships, and it makes her a survivor. She has enough scars and pain in her past to be alert and in a defensive mode. She doesn't trust others, and it is not a good idea to challenge her intellectually. She could be an impressive adversary. Fincher's Lisbeth is mostly style and pouts very well. There are flashes of her strength, but it is not consistent with the source material. Additionally, Fincher has added some touches to the movie that emphasize the ugliness of her world, sometimes it tips the feel of the movie, going a little too far. It becomes too graphic, too lurid, and it cheapens the story.There is also an issue with the way the film is a little too long with the way some of the characters are introduced, and some situations are detailed to the point that it seems to question the audience's ability to make deductions. Did we need to go into a shopping spree to set up the big scene near the end? Once again, I'd love to hear an explanation for the ending? Why?

Watching the original Swedish version of "The Girl with the Dragon  Tattoo," I was actively engaged with its dual story lines, but I also  found myself pondering which of the two was the more important. Now  that David Fincher has made an English-language remake, I find myself  pondering what went wrong. Here is a mystery thriller so cold, so  distant, and so lacking in energy that it feels neither mysterious nor  thrilling. It follows the plot of the original film fairly closely, and  yet it makes a number of small changes that drastically affect its  credibility. I'm also stumped by the curious decision to retain the  Swedish setting. If you have gone to the trouble of casting  English-speaking actors, it seems only fitting that you should change  the story's location to somewhere more appropriate, say America or  Britain.  Adapted from the novel by Stieg Larsson, the title is a description of  goth chick Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), an emotionally walled-off  computer hacker who works for a security company. In the original film,  we got only scraps of her back story, and yet just enough was given to  pique our interest. We were challenged to read her. Who was she? What  had she gone through? What led up to a disturbing watershed moment seen  only in flashback? In this remake, her back story doesn't even amount  to crumbs. That watershed moment is altogether removed, as is a  significant chunk of her family history. Because of this, we're no  longer compelled to probe her mind, to try and understand why she is  the way she is. All we see is a girl in her early twenties in serious  need of an attitude adjustment.  She was hired to investigate a former reporter turned magazine  publisher named Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), who lost a libel case  against a powerful billionaire. Although he must pay a serious amount  in damages, he insists that he was set up. Lisbeth is inclined to  agree; her investigative work turned up nothing incriminating. Not long  after the trial, Mikael is hired by a man named Dirch Frode (Steven  Berkoff) on behalf of his employer, Henrik Vanger (Christopher  Plummer), the former CEO of a family industry. Now retired on a  family-owned island off the mainland, he asks two things of Mikael: To  write a memoir about the Vanger clan and to investigate the case of his  great-niece, Harriet, who disappeared in 1966 when she was only a  teenager. Henrik is convinced she was murdered, and that her killer is  a member of his family, with whom he does not get along.  Needing an assistant, Mikael is directed towards Lisbeth, who has just  worked her way of a particularly nasty situation with her new guardian,  a sadistic sexual pervert (Yorick van Wageningen) who kept strict  control of her finances. As she and Mikael dig deeper into the mystery,  they must make sense of a series of numbers Harriet wrote in a  notebook, all of which are paired with initials. What do they mean? How  do they connect to a series of murders spread across time and distance,  all involving young women? And in what way does Henrik's family factor  in? Watching the original film, I anxiously awaited the moment the  mystery would be solved. That's because, as contrived as it was, there  was at least the sense that the filmmakers were interested in their own  material. The same cannot be said about this new film. There's no  urgency about it.  I think much of the blame rests on the updated screenplay by Steven  Zaillian, which awkwardly intertwines dark and twisted scenarios with  an undercurrent of dry wit. When Henrik first meets Mikael, for  example, we find that the former is almost jovial  not at all  appropriate given his sad situation. Certain scenes from the original  film were intense, and yet they always felt as if they were character  driven. That's not the case here; most of the intense scenes, including  when Lisbeth spontaneously decides to have sex with Mikael, are  overproduced, as if the intention was to be sensational. The most  glaring misfire is the inclusion of a stray cat. I don't need to spell  out what happens to it. I will say, however, that this plot device is  so overused that it has long since ceased to be symbolic. Now it's just  cruel and disgusting.  Little touches, such as Mikael's affair with his magazine coworker  (Robin Wright) and his relationship with his religious teenage daughter  (Josefin Asplund), contribute absolutely nothing to the story apart  from a surplus of characters. And then there's the ending, which is  really more of an epilogue as it involves events unrelated to the case  of Harriet Vanger. In the original film, it was a brief couple of  scenes that tied up a few loose ends. Here, it goes on much longer than  it should. I'm usually the first to give remakes the benefit of the  doubt. It's certainly not my style to make endless comparisons between  old and new versions of the same story. But in the case of "The Girl  with the Dragon Tattoo," I just can't help myself. I'll make this easy  on you: See the original instead of the remake. Quite simply, the  original is better.  -- Chris Pandolfi

ALERT: THERE IS CURSING, NUDITY, SMOKING, AND A FAST MOTORCYCLE.GO SEE IT!!I know about the books. I know about the Euro-films. I paid no attention to them.... I went in cold, wanting an unbiased opinion to the Hollywood version.1) Craig played this roll brilliantly. His 007 "stereo-typing" is no longer in question.2) This flick is l-o-n-g. 2.6 hours. Yes, my butt told me it needed shifting. But, this flick kept me wanting more, and I got it.3) Thinking. There are places in this flick where you must think on your own, making your own conclusions. I love this in a drama, I get to play a part, I'm also an investigator.4) Next: THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE. This is a trilogy, ya know.5) Get the LARGE popcorn.

David Fincher's remake of TGWTDT has enough to keep the film steady on its feet, but lacks a horde of specific qualities from Oplev's excellent effort. Firstly, in a basic mystery story, there is a need to present a series of twists and discoveries that lead to solving the mystery. Fincher's film fails to present this trail of bread crumbs in the same enticing way that Oplev's did. Instead, we get a fast forward hyperspace logic jump when Blomkvist's daughter (out of nowhere) points out the vital clue that breaks the case, and then all related info is collected by Lisbeth in 5 minutes. Secondly, the following characters were shadows of themselves in the Fincher version: 1. Lisbeth Salander 2. Henrik Vanger 3. Martin Vanger 4. Bjurman The actors weren't horrible, but they were not as good as the ones in the Swedish version. Lastly, there were key omissions and changes which, for me, were completely inexplicable and confusing. 1. Lisbeth's past, father, etc. was one or two lines of dialog. 2. Harriet Vanger in London? 3. Vanger does not tell Blomkvist that he knew Harriet.It all adds up to a disappointing attempt to recreate the dark energy of Oplev's film. And the opening sequence was like a Tool video mixed with bad James Bond.

Here is a rundown of the differences in the two movies:-MIKAEL BLOMKVIST-American - Blomkvist is played as more of a tough guy and not a good guy. His flaws are laid bare and he shows himself to be much more detached than emotional.Swedish - This is the "good guy" side of Mikael. He is sensitive, caring, and smart. He shows a protective side when it comes to Lisbeth. Physically speaking the Swedish Blomkvist doesn't look as sturdy as his American counterpart. He has a gut and appears to be quite a bit older than Lisbeth which can make the relationship between them more shudder inducing and probably accounts for why there are fewer sex scenes between them in the Swedish version. -LISBETH SALANDER-American - Perhaps because Blomkvist was made into such a strong character Lisbeth was then morphed into a more withdrawn and vulnerable girl so as to complement the new Blomkvist. She still has attitude, aggression, and rage but she also exhibits a quiet shy side that was not in the original as well as more of a romantic side.Swedish - In this version Lisbeth is not shy, not gentle, and not nice. She doesn't chase Blomkvist - he chases her. She perfectly embodies everything you think of when you think of a strong female lead and has an unpredictability and edge to her that is exciting to watch. Her dragon tattoo is much, much better.-OVERALL- I liked the American Mikael and the Swedish Lisbeth. While I may prefer a scene or two from the Swedish version, such as the ending, overall I enjoyed the American version more. On the flip side, I can understand why some may hate this version because Lisbeth was their favorite character and she's been changed into something they don't like. For me, the modifications to Lisbeth's character weren't severe enough to put me off.The Swedish version captured a cult following for a reason and I would recommend both to anyone who has an interest in darker gritty movies that have a raw intensity to them. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo isn't for the faint of heart and that's what I love about it!

"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is poised as an enigmatic mystery-thriller of real cinematic and storytelling potential, with a superb cast and gripping performances to bet on. Filmgoers used to David Fincher, with similar titles such as "Seven" and "The Game" to his name, are all in a fuss to see what is next in the Fincher oeuvre. What we know of David Fincher, is that although he's created such classic films, he's always done it with a paintbrush not so famously modest. While we've always appreciated this granular and physical realism of his films, whether it was the violence in "Fight Club", or the crime scenes in "Seven", its appreciation was only served by its storytelling. Out of context, many scenes appear as almost manufactured gratuity, seemingly made just to shock audiences. Unfortunately what has happened in the "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is just that. The storytelling, narrative, and dialogue from the onset, follows through the film in a clumsy, nebulous, and poorly-written mess, making everything written seem just as bookends to a number of highly shocking scenes. These scenes, while may be factual to the original story, are what the director seems to have focused his creativity on. And all that comes out of it, not mincing words, is purely shocking rapist-pornography. If I were to write off the film for these scenes, which I think is enough, it would be too easy. Lisbeth, one of the central characters, whom is the victim in these disturbing scenes, is depicted from the onset as an almost completely unsympathetic character. She's introduced as an antisocial, mute, even creepy prodigy of her investigative craft and leaves the film just as cold as she came in (The last scene, although narratively intended to be sympathetic, didn't change the character's complete lack of pathos) Her emotions, even though apparently warm for Mikael (Daniel Craig), are not particularly warming for the audience, as her emotional depth, personality, and sexuality on screen seems more dark, twisted, and expressionless as the man who rapes her. The film successfully depicts her as a "mute creep", and a completely unlikable and unsympathetic character. While you may hear groundswell rumblings for a best-actress nomination for Lisbeth by passionate fans of the film, it's my impulse to remind that those usually nominated, and those that win, normally have one of two things in common: Sympathy or Empathy. Many "heroes" may have Sympathy. And many "villains" may have Empathy. We don't feel fellowship or pathos for a "villain" (i.e.: Sympathy), but we might understand their motivations and emotions (i.e.: Empathy), as however their successfully displayed (i.e.: Macbeth). The tragedy of Lisbeth is that she's depicted as a "hero" under the guise and manner of a particularly mute "villain", with the result being that she lacks either really any Sympathy or Empathy. The film, luring audiences as a potentially great and classic Mystery-thriller, with Fincher's exquisite eye and style, is nothing but barely a facade to shock audiences. I feel personally terrible for all the families and children who could be going during this Christmas season to see it, under the impression that whatever R-rated scenes in the film will be negligible for what is successfully advertised as a possible classic-in-the-making of a very well-written Mystery. These scenes are X-rated material, I personally find it hard to believe they've received just an R rating.

I'm going to begin by saying that I read the books first, watched the 2009 films afterwards, and I have just come back from seeing Fincher's adaptation for the second time. And Fincher's is by far the superior of the films. I am no stranger to the story and experienced it in the "proper order" as many elitist fans would call it. (While the ever more elitist "fans" would not have even watched Fincher's version). Fincher's Direction is superior; Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross's musical genius sets the perfect tone for the film, and best of all, the cast lends themselves to a brilliant story in ways that I believe would be irreproducible by any other actor/actress. I may be blasphemous for saying this but I don't care. Rooney Mara nailed the role better than Noomi Rapace and I look forward to Fincher's future endeavours with Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist in coming years. And as for you people who are ever insistent on the same lame-@$$ed arguments to appear like you know what everyone else "should" enjoy...original languages do not make a movie good. "Passion of the Christ" was not more enriching because it was in Arabic. Not wanting to read subtitles is not a curse of the Lazy Man and the fact that you do does not mean you are more intelligent, cultured, or artistic. It means you are boastful,arrogant, and are looking for something to make you feel superior instead of going to watch a movie for a good story. If you want to be 100% pure in your Stieg Larsson enjoyment, learn Swedish, move to Stockholm, and bask in the glory that is your raging unmerited self esteem. If a language is reason for you not to enjoy something, you've missed the point entirely of watching a movie.

I have read all three of Stieg Larsson's books and seen the Swedish movies. The Swedish version of The girl with the dragon tattoo(Män som hatar kvinnor) was very good but I feel it is somewhat overrated. Nothing particularly weak about it but still not as good as some claim. When word came about that David Fincher would direct the new one I was just overjoyed. My maybe favourite director working right now filming one of the best books I had read in years. With thrillers like Se7en and Zodiac to his credit he was the perfect choice. And he doesn't disappoint.The big question for many have been will Rooney Mara live up to Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander? The answer is She does! Who is better is difficult to say because they actually play the character quite different. Noomi is older and seems more secure and determined character while Mara feels more fragile and emotional. I feel Mara is more like how Lisbeth is described in the book. I like this movie better but regarding Lisbeth Salander it's a draw. Daniel Craig is great as Blomkvist, and it's good that even if he is a big star(James Bond) he plays the role really down to earth, the person the character should be. It is and should be Salander who is the main one and he lets Mara be the star. One actor who really surpasses his predecessor is Stellan Skarsgård. Considering his character has such a big role this is a big plus for the American version. Christopher Plummer should also be mentioned. As I'm now on the actors I should also mention the relation between Salander and Blomkvist. Craig and Mara are brilliant at creating chemistry. Not only does one focus on the mystery but at the end maybe even more about them. Do they really speak with a Swedish accent? Some of them yes and I admit it felt a bit strange a first but one gets used to it like with most other things so some time later in the movie I didn't mind anymore. Steven Zaillian deserves praise for the script. The original movie, even though it was not much shorter the plot at times felt rushed. Especially the ending where it went so quick and simplified. Zaillian succeeds in fitting the story without making it to fast or simple. Even if one hasn't read the book you can follow what is going on. Very impressive and perhaps what lifted this movie above the Swedish. So there are some changes but for me, unlike how some feel about adaptations, the book isn't something holy and changes don't have to be wrong. Stieg Larsson's novel was not without flaws and the changes they made make sense, necessary and some better. Fincher is a master of suspense and shows it again here. The atmosphere and tone of the settings fit the story perfect. The movie is brutal just like the book and also that is handled great. Neither reduced or overdone. The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is as expected amazing. Almost as great as for The Social Network. I loved the opening credits set to the tones of the Immigrant Song cover. Some may feel it's a bit out of place but personally I loved it. So are there any weak points in it? Well the last parts of the movie the story slows down somewhat but thats because Stieg Larsson's novel was like that and those parts are also needed for the continuing of the series. And even if I really like the Millennium trilogy, the story is not perfect not as complicated as some might expect. Doesn't mess with your head like Se7en. If I'm to rank David Fincher's detective thrillers The girl with the dragon tattoo is below Se7en and Zodiac but it doesn't mean it is a weak movie, definitely not! I don't think I can find much they could have done better. The Swedish movie was good but this is much better. It lives up to my expectations as a fan of the book. Also works great as a thriller on it's own.

Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is essentially a whodunit layered by a story about an investigative journalist getting his professional dignity stripped from him and then reaffirmed. It's central focus being that the title character Lisbeth, is a bad ass never back down girl who is stuck in between a rock and a hard place and performs several lewd, violent, and otherwise "bad" acts in order to get what she wants. Where the movie loses its center is in emphasizing the seemingly usual whodunit plot line that is the heart of this story, but not its soul, which lies in the personal stories of its characters.Before the bad stuff, let's talk about the good stuff. The stories of Lisbeth and the whodunit are both crafted superbly. While I can't say either of them are different or challenging the mainstream craft of these types of story lines, it doesn't change how visceral the scenes within are. I don't want to give anything away, but I want to say that there are a minimum of three scenes in this movie that made my skin crawl and my seat feel physically uncomfortable, but in a great way that only movies can manage. Note: This movie is really not for the weak of heart.Both lead actors do well with their roles. Lisbeth is brought to life in every blank stare and movement, yet something about the whole character seems very statue like, I can't figure out if it's good or bad, but it was believable in any case. As for Daniel Craig, I've enjoyed his turns as James Bond, and this role is like a less secret agent version of that role.In all reality I look at this movie and I believe that what's been done here is very good, possibly the best film of this year, but I would assert that that statement is not saying much. This has not been a great year at the movies.However let's address what I was alluding to about the heart of the movie and the soul of the movie. Where the movie spends much of its filming genius and storyline is in the whodunit plot line. Intricate set pieces with perhaps one too many family members and flashbacks and pictures all lend themselves to a formulaic mystery plot line that serves as the driving point of staying with the movie. However, before starting that plot line and for about the last thirty or so minutes of the movie, that's not what this movie is about.While the movie spends so much time working the whodunit, several other more interesting things have happened and eventually happen that get skated over because the biggest part of the running time was spent on David Fincher's version of noir, without all the pulp that comes with the cop drama. Just about every moment of the film that doesn't have to do with this central theme has more interesting elements, but none of them are spent with much time, its almost like they were put in the movie just so people couldn't point and say, "You left this this this and this out of the movie when they were in the book," but they are thrown together so fast and recklessly that it leaves me wondering if the book truly skated over these plot points with such abandon or if I have to go read it to get what feels like the actual story.The biggest issue comes from its central characters only participating in the whodunit because there in lies something they want. For all the time the film spends making Lisbeth a bad ass new age woman that gets what she wants for herself, they spend a lot of the film showing that she really is just a dressed up girl, who makes her self out as a vamp. None of this is more painfully shown than in the last shot of the movie, which I'll let all of you experience for yourselves.While I like this film, something about it is just unbalanced from the story perspective. Why in a story rife with intrigue into the inner ties of corporate leaders and secrecy and shadows and computer hacking type activities must the plot butter up the seen a thousand times whodunit and skip the icing with the stories centered around these overarching elements? It doesn't make sense, and I firmly believe this film misses something from the book. Maybe I am wrong about that, but it makes the film seem unbalanced in that aspect.And yet it is a good film. I will give it an 8 out of 10.

If you saw and liked the original Swedish film based on Stieg Larsson's novel "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," you might be pleased or disappointed with David Fincher's English-language remake for the same reason: this is a pretty straight-forward remake with few surprises for fans of Neil Arden Opley's 2009 adaptation of the same material. Even the leading players, Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, seem to have been chosen because of their resemblance to Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.Despite its familiarity, I found this version as engrossing as the first with the cast more than equal to the challenge of bringing these characters to life. And if you're looking for a great insult to direct at an enemy, the phrase on Mara's T-shirt in one scene is a masterpiece of raunchy perfection. I think Leo the Lion, M-G-M's mascot, may have read it, too, which could explain why his roar was silent for a change when the company logo appeared on screen before the movie.Be sure not to miss the opening titles which reminded me of the opening of a Bond film as it might appear in a nightmare.

I was thrilled when I heard that this wonderful book, translated from the original Swedish, would be made into a movie. My husband and I both were fans from the get go. I expected some omissions and can forgive the omission of Blomkvist's affair with Cecilia, but cannot forgive the change in the end of the story ... another Hollywood thinks they are better than the author fiasco. Why oh why does this happen to all great books? Why do they have to dumb it down? Of course, they will make another and another. How will they screw with the next two? One can only imagine. I do however recommend you see it. Make sure you wear a sweater, it is cold throughout most of the movie and it is winter you know.

I guess there's no need to beat around the bush. I'll go ahead and say that Rooney Mara deserves the Academy Award for best actress due to her powerful, yet disturbing role as Lisbeth Salander in this film. Now, with that being said, this movie is why I go to the theater. The setting was perfect, the acting was amazing, the writing was superb, and in my honest opinion, the film clearly separates itself from the Swedish version that many (including myself) saw and loved. It's an American telling of a Swedish novel and everybody dialed it up big time for this movie. Now this is not a movie that I would take a child to go see and I would be skeptical of taking friends to see it around the holidays due to the disturbing content, but it is still beyond amazing. This movie forces you to pay close attention to every little detail when it comes to solving a mystery and the ending is not one you would expect if you had never read the novel. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo shows you the darkest side of people (especially men and I can't go into that without telling you about the film.) I can't say enough about Rooney Mara who transforms herself for this role. For those of you who are dead-set on bashing this film because you love Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth, if you let that go for a little while, you will see like I do, a film that is deserving of every single award it WILL win and consideration as one of the best films of the last 20 years.

The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is brilliantly done in ways better then the book and way better then the 2009 version. Though I didn't dislike the 09 version I thought they left out parts from the book that I thought should've been shown. David Fincher's version you pretty much don't have to read the book. Follows it amazingly. Took parts out that could and needed to be taken out and shorten parts of the book with beautifully done shorter scenes to get the point across which was better then the books longer sequences. Even put a little twist at the end that didn't effect the story and was in my opinion better then the book original. Best Fincher opening sequence movie title which he's been known for in the past with Trent Reznor and Karen O's remake of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant song. Reznor does a great job with subtle music that sets the mood and matches exactly the emotion you feel in the scenes in the movie and story.Daniel Craig of course is great as Mickael but Rooney Mara easily steals the movie in her performance as Lisbeth Salander. How she played Lisbeth is exactly how I pictured her. The way the book describes her quirks and how she holds and smokes her cigarette Rooney did perfectly. She plays the blend of toughness and vulnerability that is Lisbeth Salander in perfect blend. Making herself beautiful behind the tattoos and piercings that Lisbeth is known to be in the books. I want to see at least an Oscar nod for her role. As much as I love Keira Knightly and Natalie Portman I can't see them in that role after seeing Rooney Mara play her. That's how perfect she played her.

Bottom line: Rooney Mara is razor-sharp in this stylish but very uneven (and very long) very dark drama. It's about 30 minutes too long--and the final half-hour, which focuses on an unrelated (and uninteresting) villain, torpedoes the entire movie. I figured out who the ultimate villain was very early on (due to unfortunate casting---as the actor always plays the heavy so it was no surprise at all). I really, really wanted to love this movie and waited with great anticipation for its opening for months. Alas, I left disappointed. And judging from the other movie-goers reaction, I wasn't alone. For such a strong start, the ending was milquetoast and not worthy of the build-up.

The lights dim, the movie begins with a brief prologue, and the zany and incredibly weird opening credits begin, set to a creepy cover of Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song." From the beginning, we are in for a wild ride as Stieg Larsson's incredibly popular novel "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is brought to life on screen.Scorned journalist Mikael Blomkvist is called upon by Henrik Vanger, a very wealthy man, while writing a book. Vanger is in search of an answer to the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, which occurred over 40 years ago. He assumes that Harriet is dead, and that she was murdered. He looks to Mikael to investigate her disappearance and who killed her. Then Mikael gets assistance from Lisbeth Salander, a dangerous but intelligent 24 year-old punk who is an accomplished computer hacker and a great contribution to the solving of other crimes. Together, Mikael and Lisbeth go on a dark, eerie journey into a world of crime, Nazism, and corruption that will lead them to Harriet's assassin.I walked into "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" with almost no knowledge of Larsson's novel or the Swedish film made a few years before David Fincher's version. The end result is ultimately an extremely satisfying, brutal, and complex thriller thanks to great direction by Fincher (known greatly for his work on "Seven," "The Game," and "The Social Network"), excellent writing, and an impeccably chosen cast.After only a few years, the character of Lisbeth Salander has become an attention-grabbing heroine that is as iconic as Edward Cullen of the love-it-or-hate-it "Twilight" series. And we can understand why. After all the truly awful and hideous things that have plagued her life, Lisbeth doesn't take any crap from anybody. She may be angry, violent, overtly sexual, demanding, and perhaps a little crazy, but she is a genius at what she does, and has reasons for all of her actions, no matter how gruesome they may be.The mystery surrounding the film is sophisticated and white-knuckling, adding to the intensity and mood of the story and its characters. We're not sure of who is Harriet's killer, or if Harriet is even dead, until the last half hour of the film, and when we do find out the twist, it leaves a stupendous impact.After cementing his reputation in brutal crime thrillers, and surprising us with "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" and "The Social Network," David Fincher was the right man for the director's chair. Every film he makes, even a drama like "The Social Network," sets up a tone of genuine suspense, tension, and fear for the characters. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" isn't any different as Fincher adds his signature touch to the movie.Of all of the people they could have chosen to play these roles, the casting director landed in a pot of gold. Daniel Craig does a wonderful job as Mikael, showing us that he can play characters other than James Bond. With the amount of screen time she has, Robin Wright is also very good as Blomkvist's business partner Erika Berger. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgård also turn in great performances as Henrik Vanger and Martin Vanger.The person to really watch out for, however, is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Getting her big break in the underrated remake of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and later starring in Fincher's previous film "The Social Network" (giving a dynamite performance in the opening scene), Mara has sealed her future with many more promising and exciting roles because of her portrayal of Lisbeth. This is not an easy role to play, knowing that Mara is the second person to play the character. She must endure two shocking rape scenes and a torture sequence, and there is a hefty amount of nudity involved. Mara embodies Lisbeth, immediately bringing immense intimidation, danger, and fury every time she comes on to the screen. Her eyes are wide and emotionless, almost as if you can see right through her. And with everything that has happened to the character, we understand that Lisbeth has a right to be that way. She may be smart, but she is not interested in attraction or friendships with another human being. Overall, Mara gives a sensational, fearless, dedicated, and electrifying performance that guarantees an Oscar nod.Being released during the cheery time of the holidays, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is not a feel-good film, by any means. It is a harsh, gritty, and rough cinema trip that answers the question of leaving the kids at home with the babysitter. Also, if you're squeamish, you will not like it. However, those who have read the book, and those who have not read it, should check it out. Even without having read Larsson's novel, I left the theater completely satisfied. It is a movie experience that you don't commonly get. Fincher has done it again. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a must!

I have always read reviews and not taken the time to actually write my own, but for this film Ill make the exception.For a fan of the books, I have seen the first Swedish film and now living in Sweden, working where it was filmed in Uppsala. I had a huge interest on how this film would reflect the book and more importantly Sweden.Without giving too much away, I think this film has done an excellent job, I have abstained from giving a full 10 due to the slight change to the ending.For me, the level of detail, subtleties of how we eat Sandwiches with cheese on the single slice of bread, the Swedish response when Mikael couldn't get a signal on his phone and much more. I loved this film and has truly put Sweden back on the map, its not all ABBA you know.Rooney Mara in my opinion played Lisbeth better than Noomi as I thought Noomi Rapace was too old. The Swedish film didn't really mention the Wennerström affair and the money, which is a major platform for the next 2 books.For a solid cast, great setting, I highly recommend this film.

***Update*** I just screened the Swedish trilogy... They are riveting. The Fincher picture is better filmed, but isn't. Riveting that is. The Swedish characters have more depth, they aren't expanded into iconic figures as are Finchers', they are more real. Rapace would NEVER show a romantic interest in Blomqvist as Mara does at the end of the US pic; there's an expectation that everyone should swoon over Daniel Craig. Which is off kilter. She would never buy him an expensive gift - she would barely offer a thanks. We'll see what the next two are like.Back to my review of the USA version . . .Having watched "TGWTDT USA" last night I'm not really convinced that it needed doing. Yes I liked the plot changes; they tightened up the story and allowed time to be spent in a few other parts of the script (notably in the rape and sex scenes). But was it worth $100 million to do a remake when the original is still playing on movie channels? Probably not. The opening credits are impressive, but seem to relate more to a new "Batman" than this picture. A sign of having way too much money available in the budget. They got the film off to a little bit of a confusing start. I admit to not being a Daniel Craig (Mikael Blomkvist) fan, frankly he reminds me more than a little of an evil gnome of some sort, a Rumpelstilskin (which does however fit well with the Nordic locale of this picture). He does his usual perfunctory job in this film adding nothing really that we hadn't seen from Michael Nyqvist. For me, he was a little too fit and hunky for the role; Blumqvist is a journalist not a fitness trainer and needs the associated love handles and pot belly of a professional scribbler. Was I the only one who noticed the resemblance of Blumqvist's daughter in the movie to Michael Nyqvist? Rooney Mara is very good in her role as Lisbeth Salander, but not any better that Noomi Rapace. She (Mara) does borrow so much for her performance from Rapace's work, that it's difficult to give her full credit. I think Rapace, from her acting, was more believable as a hacker, as a victim and as a vengeance taker. (I will admit that I'm always suspicious when an actress from a billionaire family gets a plum role or recording contract which work against my consideration of Ms Mara. {"Daddy can I be a model, an actress and a singer today?") Where this production catches up to the previous version in my rating is in its cinematography; a hundred million goes a long way to creating exactly what the writer and director want the audience to see. And this production certainly does that. It is brilliantly filmed. The picture also is notable for its dramatic and highly visual scenes of violence and sex, perhaps the most graphically accurate ever put to screen. Good on David Fincher. Well done.

After reading all 3 books by Larson, I saw the movie yesterday and am Pleased that the plot followed the book in almost all instances given that there's only so much time to follow the book in its entirety. I thought it was well done, even though I would have been pleased WITHOUT the intimate sexual scenes with Blomqvist. Photography was well done and detail was attended throughout the movie. I would like to have seen more dialog regarding Elizabeth's computer skills as that was played up well in the book. All in all I really did enjoy the presentation and am looking forward to, hopefully, the next installment.I rate it 9+

I will start out writing that I never read the books or watched the original movie. I'm writing this based just on the film that was presented and nothing else. That being stated, this film was a tedious, convoluted mess of nonsense, graphic rape-torture, and mostly stereotyped uninspired casting.I am not going to give a detailed synopsis, you can get that elsewhere. All I will say is the plot has something to do with an industrialist who hires Daniel Craig to find out who killed his niece. The graphic rape-torture scenes make you feel like you are watching a snuff film. The casting of the rapist was almost laughable. A fat, creepy looking Yorick van Wageningen plays the rapist. The reality is rapists look like everyone else. I'm surprised he did not have an eye patch and a scar on his face. Another point, what predator (Wageningen) would pick a would be victim who he knows has a history of unpredictability, violence, and works for a security company! Totally unrealistic.I really do not understand the people who love this film. I think their positive reviews say more about them then it does the movie....

First off, I want to say that I have not seen the original Swedish adaptation and I have not read the book. This is simply a review of the movie itself, judging as nothing more than a movie. Also, this will contain spoilers.Call me crazy, but I don't get this movie. That is not to say that I don't understand what happened, but I do not understand the point of this movie. From my seat, it seemed like a movie that is vulgar for the sake of being vulgar and cruel for the sake of being cruel.The rape scene was completely disgusting. Furthermore, I am not entirely sure what the point of the whole sequence with the social worker really added to the movie. Lisbeth had a very difficult and dark life, I am not sure that we really needed to see it to that intensity.Then we have the actual plot itself. Mikael is hired to track down Henrik Vanger's granddaughter who he believes was murdered decades earlier by another member of the family. Mikael and Lisbeth end up discovering that they are looking for a serial killer within the family which turns out to be a father and son and get this, it has almost nothing to do with the actual disappearance of Hillary, the granddaughter. Then there is the ending, after Mikael and Lisbeth have a little bit of a tryst during their hunt for Hillary, Lisbeth gets completely forgot by Mikael who goes back to his girlfriend.In short, the movie is all about taking a huge, gigantic dump on the girl with the dragon tattoo for no apparent reason.

For everyone who is about to read this and get excited over the fact that this movie is awful, I have a delightful surprise! I'm hoping those of you who clicked this to agree with me actually read this review because I have something different to say.This movie was absolutely fantastic. I saw the Swedish version immediately after reading ALL 3 BOOKS, and I liked their take on the first book. The last 2 movies they made were boring as hell and had no thrill to them whatsoever.However, this David Fincher flick is SWEET! Right from the opening credits, you're immersed in a tech-trance of wonder. The opening credits show glimpses of angry hornets and fires blazing, obviously pointing out the fact that Fincher is game for the next 2 adaptations.Every aspect of this movie had me engaged and extremely entertained. I didn't see the Swedish version on the big screens, but I listened to it with my lovely Bose headphones, and the score was simply unimpressive when compared to the American version.Fincher's take on Blomkvist and Salander are superb. Mikael is not just Daniel Craig pumping out his normal demeanor and smooth accent. He is an actual character that you are interested in! You want to know why he is able to shag the wife of his co-worker, and continue to use his charm to attract even the most unlikely candidates-Lisbeth.Lisbeth is purely the main character, and those who haven't read the books still get a good idea of her almost-soulless attitude. Her character is expressed beautifully. The toughest scenes (if you read the book you would know) seem to come naturally to Rooney. It's as though Salander were a real person and Rooney studied with her for 2 years in Sweden.As for the mystery aspect of it, some may be able to figure out the ending from the beginning if they have some weird NCIS instinct. However, I know that there were details I forgot from the book that Fincher encompassed perfectly in his take.If you are heart-set on the Swedish version, and rate this movie poorly, shame on you. The boring Millennium-centered dialogue that fill the Swedish version are drastically cut back. In fact, I don't believe they spent more than 2 or 3 scenes inside Millennium. If you care about movies continuing to be spectacular, then go see this movie. Compare it to the Swedish version for all I care, but understand that there is no way this movie deserves anything less than 6/10. I give it 10/10, where I would rate the book version a 9/10 had I the ability to compare.

I can't say that there are many films where I find myself hooked before the movie ever begins.....but, this one "got me" as soon as the lights dimmed and the title credits began to flicker on screen. My litmus test for judging films is based upon how long after the film I am still thinking about it. I won't keep you in suspense. When it comes to that test, this film not only passed with flying colors....but totally NAILED it! I will be thinking about "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" for quite some time and, most likely, I will see it again during my holiday vacation. There is so much I want to pay more attention to during the next viewing; even though there are portions in which I will cover my eyes, as well. This is not an easy film to view. There are some pretty graphic sexual and violent scenes. If you are considering whether to see it now, or wait for cable - I assure you, this film is meant to be seen on the big screen. And, this isn't because it is in 3D or some other campy fad...it is because it is an excellent, suspenseful, white knuckler.It would be very easy to say that the one reason to see this film is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander (the title character) - but that would be too simple....too obvious.....too benign. While this role is pretty much one of the most fascinating characters I've seen on screen for some time, I can honestly say that there are many, many more reasons to view this film. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a thriller that just doesn't stop. Just when you think it's over and the story is done....it keeps going......as you sit in the theatre on the edge of your seat, as if you are riding the wildest, scariest, most exciting roller coaster you've ever been on. There are times during the film that I found myself squirming in my chair, completely uncomfortable with what was being projected, but unable to look away. I never knew where this film was going; it surprised me....shocked me......thrilled me.I borrowed the book quite a while ago, and I had resisted reading it - as I knew the film was coming out and I purposely didn't want to know very much about the storyline. I could see from the coming attractions that this movie was going to be an adventure and I wanted to ride that adventure.....not knowing the final destination. I am pleased to say that I do not regret that decision. (I will, by the way, read the book now).I will not give away very much of the plot. The film is meant to be experienced. Too much knowledge of the storyline.....would ruin it, in my opinion. Daniel Craig portrays Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter and Rooney Mara portrays the mysterious Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. During the first portion of the film, the plot follows these characters separately....while the viewer is left to consider and wonder what, where, and when the dots will be connected. Both story lines are riveting....as each time the film cut from Craig's character to Mara's character (or vice versa), I found my mind still focused on the previous scene, wondering what was going to happen next.There are quite a few name stars in the film.....(Christopher Plummer, Robin Wright, Joely Richardson)...but the star is the film. I loved the camera work, the direction, the editing...the acting. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is just really, really good film making.There is one particular scene, when an extremely heinous character was figuratively hit with the Karma bus that I actually found myself giving a loud cheer right there in the movie theatre.For the younger crowd, with the short attention spans - you may find yourself having a difficult time getting into the film, as you may be used to multiple car chases and lots of action within the first few minutes of a film. I am going to plead with you to have a bit of patience and allow the story to unfold. When all is not revealed in the first 15 minutes, it is actually plain old good story telling. I know in these days of instant messaging and pop-ups - you may not be used to that....but do give it a chance. You won't be disappointed!

"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a series of scenes of sadomasochistic torture. The most graphic scene depicts a large adult male violating a female who has the body of a pubescent girl. There are other, less graphic scenes where males are subject to sadomasochistic torture. There is a series of still photographs of women who have been subjected to sadomasochistic torture. Audience members who are attracted to that activity, or fantasies of it, will very much want to see this film. They will be rewarded by it. The film will inspire some to pursue the opportunity to violate women and girls. The filmmakers will profit from others' pain. A flimsy, utterly vanilla murder plot – a plot out of a C-grade episode of "Columbo" – is the excuse for the exploitation scenes. A girl named Harriet disappeared forty years ago from a rich family's private island in Sweden. If you're at all curious as to what happened to Harriet, do yourself a favor and perform a google search of the film's title plus the word "spoiler." You'll soon discover how vapid the plot is. The biggest mystery of the film is why all these people ostensibly living in Sweden speak English with variations on Scandinavian accents, accents that roll around unevenly between Helsinki and Vienna. Robin Wright's accent is best. Christopher Plummer's is worst. Daniel Craig doesn't even try (memories of his uneven Polish accent in "Defiance.") Harriet is being pursued by Daniel Craig, a reporter, and Lisbeth, the eponymous heroine. Lisbeth is strictly a male fantasy who could never exist in real life. She is less real than the blow-up doll Ryan Gosling fell in love with in "Lars and the Real Girl." Lisbeth has superhero powers on a computer, with weapons, on a motorcycle, and in international finance, but she is helpless when men attempt to assault her. Make the woman powerful and then violate and humiliate her: a classic motif of misogynist porn. Lisbeth has the body of a pubescent girl, and you get to see every inch of it. For the gentlemen's club crowd, Lisbeth does girl-on-girl action, but, in the end, her job is to make the male lead, and viewer, happy.As part of the film's pretentious overlay, there are lots of interior shots of Swedish furniture and exterior shots of snow. Chair. Snow. Wind. Torture. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. The film is boring. The attempts to create tension are pathetic and hackneyed. A character is alone in an archive at night. Suddenly a door is heard closing. OOOO boogedy boogedy! I'm really scared now! Evidence is pieced together and suddenly one realizes who the antagonist is. And the antagonist is creeping up upon the hero even at that very moment! Be still my heart. A killer talks for a really long time before dispatching the victim, thus potentially giving a rescuer a chance to arrive. Wow, I've never seen THAT done before! There is a completely pointless series of scenes tacked on at the end relating to high finance. So much for narrative tension and drive. Trent Reznor's score is endlessly irritating in its neediness: "Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me! I'm doing something really edgy here!" I kept thinking of Bernard Herrmann's amazing shower scene music from "Psycho," music that seemed to just be the natural sound that scene would make, music that was a seamless part of the terror. No such moments in "Tattoo." What else. Rich people are bad. Nazis are really, really bad. Rich Nazis are really, really, really bad. Fat people are worst of all. The Bible causes people to become serial killers who hate women. Interestingly, boring, pretentious torture porn, apparently, does not cause people to become serial killers who hate women. Every other Swedish home has an extensively equipped torture chamber – you missed that at IKEA, didn't you? Well, the stores ARE really big. Torture is such a popular national pastime in Sweden that you have to wonder how they make time to prepare their famous meatballs, never mind Volvos. Tourists traveling to Sweden must learn to say, "Don't tase me, Bro," in Swedish, and should never, ever drop the soap.

Plain and simple, without Lisbeth Salander, the book would be on the bottom shelf next to the $.99 value bin at Wal-Mart. The writing is sloppy, sensationalist and the story largely predictable, on top of that at least 200 pages of fluff. Even Lisbeth Salander, an abused hacker, bike riding, 88 pound ass-kicking badass is the product of massive lonely male goth fantasy. One gets the feeling Larsson stole the heroine from Peter Høeg's Smilla's Sense of Snow and then punked her out. Agatha Christie has at least a dozen books better than these.So having read all the books years ago, the story itself really never did anything for me. It's really all about Salander. Fincher did a competent if procedural job. The main complaint here is he rushes through the flat pages of dialog with no pause or rhythm at all. Many scenes involve the actors simply going through motions reciting their memorized lines with few touches of humanity. Neither movie is more than a cheap Saturday scare and to sum it up, put the cast from the Swedish film in one directed by Fincher and you've got the real deal. The most telling contrast in both movies that show where they stand is in the scene where Salander and Blomkvist are lying in bed toward the end and the writer muses to his ass kicking hacker about what she has been through. In one movie, the scene is quiet and human and the other movie, it's simply filler to the next scene. I fault Steve Zaillian's simplistic screenplay more than anything else. The Swedish one wisely compresses and simplifies many of the novels blatant flaws, while the Gringo version keeps all the boring warts.Rooney Mara does a good, if robotic job playing Larsen's motorcycle driving Goth, hacker, sex pot, but I kept looking for the one and only Noomi Rapace at every turn. Hard act to follow. Either in writing or how she was directed, Mara's Salander plays more of a young girl in love with older man, than the distant cautious (and damaged) Salander of Rapace - which is rightly or wrongly, more in line with the book and frankly more realistic. i'm not taking anything away from Rooney Mara's work, she was brave and really good. I just prefer Noomi Rapace's interpretation.Also WTF? with the James Bond intro? Wrong movie Fincher...Is Daniel Craigvrequiring this in his contracts now?

This movie was so slow and boring, only to be peppered with nothing but ridiculous scenes for shock value. I didn't find it suspenseful (as you could figure out the guilty person on your own pretty easily), I just found it desperate to shock.I'm so disappointed because I couldn't wait to see it.I'm not sure what the awesome actors were thinking when they agreed to do this movie. There really is an all-star cast.I heard someone snoring, others walked out, and a few teenage boys said they wished they'd walked out. Yes, folks, it was that bad.

Although I've read all three of the books (structurally, they're really 3 installments of one big honking novel), I haven't seen the Swedish movies. Forget about the books. Forget about the other movies. On its own, this adaptation does manage to capture the general tone and resonance of the novels, and it does this with admirable brevity and to-the-bone editing. There is a bleakness in the novels that is nicely encapsulated by the exterior and interior backgrounds. Snow. The sterility of Martin Vanger's modern house on the hill. The cool patina of years on the old cottage's walls, furniture, and stonework. The camera dwells on Lizbeth Salander's inexpressive face and you can almost hear her complex gears spinning away. The lighting director in this film is a genius -- and so is the cinematographer -- emotions are relayed in light and shadow so well, and the camera angles nudge our tensions without being overt about it. It's not perfect, of course. No movie version of a well-plotted novel ever is. But it strives to do the story justice, and manages to accomplish its task.

I went into this not having read the books (I actually own the trilogy though) or seen the Swedish films. This was me going as a HUGE fan of David Fincher, Daniel Craig, and as much as it pains me to say this, the scoring of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (which, by the way, there's a dude wearing a Nine Inch Nails shirt in the film. And we keep thinking Marilyn Manson's the one who sucks his own dick.) But I digress. Fincher is one of the people who made me want to get into film and pursue a career in it, which is still a work in progress. Fight Club is one of my three all-time favorites, and I'm also a huge fan of Se7en, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and The Social Network. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is none of those films.The film follows the intertwining fates of a journalist (Craig) and a social outcast (The Social Network's Rooney Mara) as they investigate a wealthy family's history in order to discover the whereabouts of a girl who went missing forty years prior. They soon discover they're in over their heads as their investigation brings them into a long history of violence against women. The film has all of the Fincher-film motifs: great dialogue, BEAUTIFUL cinematography (if not a bit creepy at times), and fantastic acting. Within the latter particularly, I found myself extremely impressed with Rooney Mara's performance, having only seen her in The Social Network and a VERY bland performance in the Nightmare on Elm Street remake. However in this, she pretty much stole the show in whichever scene she was in. But that is not what made the film for me. As I said earlier, I love the movie. But this film has possibly done something to me that no other film has: I feel very disgusting for loving it. I have never felt so uncomfortable during a film. Disturbed, yes. Quite often in fact. But this movie made me uncomfortable for watching, as if I was actually watching a rape being committed in front of me, with a group of people, and no one was calling the cops, as we were all dumfounded by the events transpiring in front of us. And make no mistake, this film is not for the faint of heart. SPOILER ALERT: The film depicts perhaps the most graphic and disturbing rape scene I have ever seen in a film, which makes me respect Mara even more for having been a part of it. Later in the film, while not as disturbing, there's also an extremely suspenseful scene edited back and forth between where Mara's character is to Craig's. I had to remind myself several times that this was not a horror film, even though many of the moments throughout suggested otherwise. So overall, I say I love the film, and if it was not for Fight Club, it would be my favorite Fincher film, including Se7en. But I cannot stress this enough, this movie is NOT for the faint of heart. I strongly recommend trying Se7en as well as any movie with a rape scene if you feel you might not be up to it, to at least test it out.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is pretty popular at our house. The trilogy has been read and all the three Scandinavian film versions have been watched. So it was with both anticipation and dread we watched the Hollywood version at the local cineplex yesterday. We walked away feeling puzzled as to why $100 million had been spent to make a movie that had already been brilliantly made only two years earlier. So tonight, we watched the Swedish version again for comparison which only re-enforced our opinions.The biggest problem with the new version is that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It was filmed in Sweden. Larsson was Swedish. Etc. Yet the Swedish elements that give the story coherence have gone AWOL in the latest incarnation. I guess this is not especially surprising considering that director Fincher wondered in a Swedish interview after filming in the north how anyone could live in such a climate. If someone is actually confused about THAT, not much else about Swedish society is going to make much sense—especially the complexities that allow that society to not merely survive but prosper.The biggest problem centers around the casting of Daniel Craig as journalist Mikael Blomqvist. Blomqvist is supposed to be a Swedish idealist working for a lefty Stockholm rag. In the Swedish version of the film, all the nuances of such a person fill every scene so well it sometimes provokes a laughter of recognition. Craig, on the other hand, seems utterly clueless about how to play such a character. The man makes a great James Bond—a Swedish intellectual, not so much.Because Craig doesn't get his character right, the whole relationship between Blomqvist and Lisbeth Salander never develops properly. This is a women who has a bunch of issues with men yet grows to trust and eventually love him. But instead of character development, we are left with the unspoken assumption of "what woman wouldn't have the hots for Daniel Craig?" While this is what makes Bond movies work, it is bizarrely out of place for this plot.And then there are the missing details that were included in the Scandinavian version. The nature of the Vanger family Fascism. The hints at why Salander is so screwed up. The role of computers in their search for the bad guy and a believable explanation for how things got done. The details of how people actually DO cope with the cold—old Henrik Vanger knows how and when to wear an expensive parka in the Swedish version.Of course, what is really missing from the Hollywood version is the politics of modern Sweden. Most people think of Sweden, if at all, as this lefty, sex-crazed, micro-society that was defined forever by the Social Democrats. What this picture misses is the role of the Swedish right wing. This may be the country of Gunnar Myrdal and Dag Hammarskjold, but it is also a country of wealthy industrialists with global connections and ambitions. The trilogy goes into extensive detail about this reality and this whole movie is about an industrialist with a bunch of Fascist siblings. Yet except for a few lines, this social tension barely makes an appearance in Fincher's telling. For example, in the Swedish version, we learn that one of the Vangers was killed fighting as a volunteer in Finland's Winter War with USSR. This detail explains volumes but it is missing in the Hollywood remake.Fincher makes a good movie but he cannot get over the contradictions of making a movie set in Sweden that has been stripped of all Swedishness. What remains is an adolescent action movie with a real James Bond in the lead role. So a $100 million was spent to make a new movie with roughly 15% of the intellectual content of a brilliantly made movie that is only two years old. I suppose it makes sense. If you are making a movie targeted at an audience that is too damn lazy to read subtitles, I suppose it is a good move to eliminate much of the intellectual content of the books and the original movie.Who knows—maybe this thing will make money. My guess is that in most markets—especially those where both versions must use subtitles anyway—the Swedish version will be far more popular because there is so much more movie. It has more details and that makes it more believable. In the end, that should count for something.

I won't add any spoilers as this is too good a movie to spoil. So how do I review it? We'll give it a shot. This is primarily about the American film.First, if you have not read the book OR seen the original Swedish film, do not do either. We take it for granted that the book is always better than the film - and that is certainly true in this case. But if you read the book first it will spoil the film, so by all means read the book, but read it after you see the film; both films. The original Swedish film is outstanding in all respects.I have a great suggestion for the world of filmmaking: The next time you find yourself with such a stunning book to make into a film, get together the American and Foreign interests and make the films side-by-side. It would drastically reduce the overall costs and just as drastically shorten the production schedule. Then you release the finished films; the US version to the US and the other version to the rest of the world.First, the story is not for the feint hearted, it's brutal at times and portrays the seamier side of humanity very graphically. The story hit most of the important stuff so there's no shortage of material. The film runs three hours, but it doesn't seem like it. The pacing and energy in it is sufficient to keep your attention. That means the writing was very good too, as was the directing. The overall film struck me unmistakably as a modern film noir. The cinematography reflects great skill and is responsible for making the film even better. The camera had great scenery to chew up and it was given delicious sets and beautiful weather to set the mood. It won't disappoint.The actors chosen to work on this project were well cast and all were excellent in their portrayals. Daniel Craig gave the character believability and a sympathetic demeanor. The young woman chosen to portray Lisbeth Salander was Rooney Mara. Mara was excellent in a very demanding role. She had to subject herself to depictions of violent victimization of the worst kind and managed to make it feel very real. I think Ms. Rooney has a great future in film if someone can find her the right parts. This part was a perfect fit for it. She really makes the movie, but as the title character she should. My only complaint at all was that the sound people didn't quite manage to make all of her spoken dialog clear in spite of the accent she adopted. The accent and her manner of delivering it were quite remarkable.All in all it's an excellent film of this genre and I was glad to have seen it.By Bruce L.

I must confess that I write this with just a bit of bias. I had already seen the original Swedish film and felt that it was one of the top ten films of the last year or so; therefore, the new version had quite a hill to climb were it to rate better (in my mind) than the earlier version.If I could forget having seen the earlier version, I would have come away from this film with the comment that it was a well done film but didn't really do justice to the book.Both Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara did very good jobs in handling their parts as written. However, with a deeper script in this version, they acted with much less nuance than did Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.The film began with a very dark, James Bondish, introduction which was really excellent. Throughout the film, the hand of the director, David Fincher, could be seen, working his magic on his vision of the book.This film varied from the book (as many films do) and from the earlier version - in most cases the changes added to the experience, although there were a couple of times the changes were a bit too far afield. I, personally, found the changed ending spoke more to how Fincher wanted the ending to be than did Stieg Larsson, the author.So, I guess the final tally is:1) If you read the book - This film, while not true to the book, is a very well done film that is well directed, well acted and generally well done.2) If you saw the original - This film doesn't reach the pinnacle that the earlier version did. It's still a good film; just not up to the standards of the original, especially in the acting department.

I first read the book, "Girl With The Dragon Tattoo" a couple of years ago. I watched the movie,the original Swedish Version with English subtitles, shortly thereafter. I was mesmerized by Rapace's character portrayal of Lizbeth Salander. Once I read that there was going to be an American version I was rather circumspect once I found out that Rooney Mara was going to play the part. Now after watching the USA version of the movie last night I have to say that not only did Miss Mara live up to the role but she exceeded my expectations. Both versions were fantastic but I liked the USA version better. I can only hope that Ms. Mara will play the part again in the sequel. There were some parts of the movie that dragged a little bit in the beginning but all in all I loved it.

For those of you who have been out of the loop re the Millennium series recently, it was announced as far back as January 2010 that Fincher would be attached to the American Dragon Tattoo film. This sparked a mixed reaction, from people who even love Fincher like there's no tomorrow. Well, it looks like people are still high off their wankery over The Social Network, another mediocre and spectacularly overrated movie. So it seems obvious the circle jerk would continue in the wake of the recent Dragon Tattoo adaptation.Problem is, there seems to be Two David Finchers. The one who made amazing movies Like Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room and The Zodiac. Then there's the Fincher who gave us the horrid Benjamin Button, the overrated above mentioned Social Network, and now this.Thing is, I for one wasn't too opposed the idea of an English language adaptation. I mean, sure it wouldn't be as authentic as the original Swedish version, nor the book. But it could still work. Craig still had the face and Mara has very striking facial features. Reznor has a unique way of scoring a film, and Fincher has a great eye for a shot, hell, he practically made a whole career our of that kind of thing.Unfortunately, the movie is nowhere near as interesting as the Swedish movie. And here's why.The Swedish movie does a good job at staying close to the source material, however, it doesn't just mindlessly piggyback off of the source material- it perfectly balanced everything out. Those who haven't read the book would be able to follow it and find it entertaining. It took its time too- it had a nice, steady, easy going pace. It was 2.5 hours, but the movie was so interesting, it went by fast and you couldn't tell.The Yank version is pretty much an exact adaptation of the book, yes. Pretty much 98% of the book was in the movie. That's NOT a good thing; to me it came off as nothing more than desperate to please the fans. It was like Zallian said "Alright, we have to mindlessly piggyback the book. I'm super scared of pissing the fans off, and so let's not edit anything down. There is no such thing as 'What may work on page doesn't necessarily work on film.'". Except... there is.Let me explain why.Niels' film showed RESTRAINT and SUBTLETY, the two things this film lacked. It focused more on the characters than every single tiny little plot device of the book. This film felt rushed and blew its way through everything. For example, the opening scene. In Niels' film, it's very powerful. The way he looks at the plant then breaks down is simply... stunning. Here? We got a half assed phone call and a shot of the plant.The opening credits, however, are class. Pointless, overly flashy and a bit gimmicky? Yes, but class, and the images fit very nicely over the Immigrant Song. I loved the shout outs to the sequels too.Unfortunately it stops there, the writer Zallian is so obsessed with capturing every event that he senselessly skips over CHARACTER DETAILS!!!!! We get no hint to the fact that Lisbeth is possibly autistic. Instead we get a scenery chewing girl who we want to punch in the face every time we see her. The whole libel thing goes over our heads completely too.And that's just the beginning.Several of the scenes are over before they even begin. It's frustrating. The rape scene was underwhelming even. In the book it was a disturbing and powerful scene. Here it's just a "lol wut" moment.As for the acting. Noomi Rapace simply cannot be replaced. She played Lisbeth exactly how the books describe her. Tough as nails, arrogant, and dangerous to herself, but with an air of special childlike innocence. Mara? She confuses good acting for chewing the scenery. She always glares and says every line like someone asked her the square root of an insanely large number. Nyqvist not only played Blomkvist just like Larsson wrote him, but he also LOOKED like the book described. Here, Craig just seems to be stuck in his Bond phase. Nothing special whatsoever.Also, for parts 2 and 3, someone needs to hire a better dialect coach. I lost count of all the times they went from American to British to a Europeanoid accent. What a joke.I wish I could recommend this, but it's a big mess. Avoid if you haven't watched the Swedish and just watch that instead.Fincher, thou hast ruined Lisbeth Salander for me.

The novel & the Swedish movie are not great by any standards (they are pretty damn good), but the "Girl", Lisbeth Salander & Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth are great anti-heroines.I'm not surprised that David Fincher made a better movie than the original. Fincher is at the top of his game here. "The Social Network", "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" & "Se7en" are better movies because the source material is better.The shock here is Rooney Mara as Salander. Rapace was electric as Salander in all 3 movies made from the Millennium trilogy. Mara is slightly better. In either incarnation you cannot tear your eyes away from the screen when Salander appears, but there something about Mara's work that runs a bit deeper than Rapace's & I'll have to see this film again to get a better handle on that.Another shock is that this "Americanized" version is a harder "R" than the Euro version. This ain't a date movie.Of course Daniel Craig is perfect as Blomkvist. Christopher Plummer is perfect as Vanger. Stellan Stelsgard (sic) briefly channels Joe Doe in a key scene. Steven Zallian's is more true to the novel despite a non-important tweak of the ending.Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross's music is mesmerizing meriting a 2nd Oscar for them. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography is worthy of the best of his late father's work. The opening title sequence is sick, twisted & brilliant with Karen O's ferocious singing charging it.The movie flags a bit in the last 15 minutes, but then ends with a bittersweet & deeply felt sigh.This is very rough stuff meant only for the serious film lover who make up all of Fincher's admirers.

I was excited to see Finches version of this fine movie. I was extremely disappointed after watching it. The acting was good...but I must say the script treatment was not as sophisticated as the original. It seemed not as smooth as the original and a bit forced in some places to get the story to flow faster. It suffers from the same sickness as most Hollywood remakes of already good movies...the sacrifice details in favor of shock, but such is the stuff of McMovieland. Everything about the movie was acceptable and on par with the original EXCEPT for the script treatment. You remember Let the Right One In? Hollywood remade that one too and to me it sucked compared to the original. Both remakes lack the ability to emotionally connect me to the characters and their goals. A bit clinically and technically treated, as though someone was in a big hurry to capitalize on the Tattoo series' success. Shame on Hollywood.

I came across an interesting review of the Swedish version of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" here: http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/ The Swedish version is less annoying than the American version which unfortunately is formulaic. The review I read is spot on in reviewing character analysis and other artistic aspects. The American Dragon will undoubtedly appeal to newbies to the trilogy or those who don't like the pacing of foreign films. Still the Swedish original is usually the best place to start and the review that I suggest could get many more people interested in bothering to see the American version or even get people to take another look at European and other foreign films which are currently experiencing a renaissance. This will provide a good synopsis: http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/

The real intrigue in Millennium Trilogy starts and ends with Lisbeth Salander. As with the books and the original Swedish movies, I can nit-pick the plots and the films to death like everyone else, but ultimately, the fact that we get to see another depiction of Salander should force most people from the fans right on down to the uninformed to see this film.To that end, I think Rooney Mara holds are own against Rapace's Salander. I initially found her style a bit too over-the-top as compared to the costume design in the Swedish film, but as the film churns and we see the Salander's army/goth exterior cast alongside her feminine sexuality Fincher does justice to the curious duality of the character. And bravo, Rooney Mara, I thought she was a bit too withdrawn in the first act of the movie, but much of that is plot driven and I really enjoyed the way this film draws more on her physical desires then the Swedish version, whether those desires are for Big Macs or orgasms.The film itself is good, not great. Apart from the opening credit fiasco that made me think of the worst modern day James Bond films and felt completely disjointed from the tone of the film, I can't find too much to criticize Fincher for. His depiction of the cold Swedish countryside, the little things like the wind in Martin's home and the rough cabin feel were all pluses. The cat's role was a nice warm up and cut down the audience moment. Reznor's score is enthralling, its one of those scores where you acknowledge its power during the movie, it doesn't blend into the background, it comes at you in waves and you feel it hitting you in the face at the right times.Criticisms include the editing back and forth between Salander and Blomquist's story lines throughout the first 40 minutes of the film. I liked the idea of trying to keep the viewer constantly linked to both characters, but we were literally jumping back and forth in 30 second intervals, it felt too cut up for my liking. Daniel Craig is a good actor, I like him and I don't know another big name actor that I'd have preferred in this role, but I agree with others who lean with the original Swedish actor (name escapes me) for the roll. Craig masters the suave and broken characters in his Bond films and Layer Cake very well, but there is a certain aesthetic missing from his portrayal of Blomquist.Lastly, I had such high expectations for Fincher's portrayal of the dark, murderous, violent aspects to the film that I felt the final act and the run up to the whodunnit resolution to be somewhat sanitized.All that said, I still give it high marks and recommend it for newbies as well as fans of the Millennium Series.

After reading all the books, and seeing all the original movies, I was worried that this movie would be disappointing. It Is Not. Filmography Outstanding. Location Gorgeous. The opening credits are such a wild ride they could win an Oscar on their own. Acting was superb. Mara, Penn, Plummer, terrific. We all know how much I love Daniel Craig, he was made for this role, not only is he sexy and talented, he plays the best torture victim (remember Casino Royale? Ouch!). The movie left me looking forward to the next installment.Nothing more to say. But this form is telling me there are not enough lines. I don't care for this restriction. I don't know why IMDb puts it in.

The Swedish version was much more well-written, orchestrated, and directed. There was a sense of suspense, emotion, and realism to the movie that the Fincher version simply lacks. Lisbeth's past is seldom explored, and when it is, it's poorly placed in the movie. The emotional connection between Mikael and Lisbeth is 'forced' at best, and quite awkward at certain moments. There are so many interesting facets about Lisbeth's personality and character that could've been explored a lot better, and you simply don't leave the theatre with the same sense of 'wow' that defined the Swedish version. The more positive thing about Fincher's version though, is Rooney Mara, who played Salander nicely.

Fincher's TGWTDT is a two and a half hour advertisement for tobacco - specifically, Marlboro brand cigarettes, the only brand smoked in the film. There is also propagandistic messaging in the movie: two scenes that ridicule those who protest indoor smoking, a main character that easily quits tobacco after using it to help him in his work, an old age smoker who smokes joyfully with no apparent health effects, and, of course, the glamor of it all. We all know there is product placement in movies, but the level of propaganda is under the radar to most people. It's a conspiracy pure and simple, but few people care about it or understand it.

Personally, I haven't seen the other versions of this movie or read the book. So I can only discuss this movie on it's own merits. The plot has deliberate pacing in developing and at times struggles to keep one's interest. Most of the characters personalities was developed as the movie progresses. The plot resolution becomes something of a back story for me once Lisabeth and Mikael finally meet. I was captivated by Rooney Mara's "Lisabeth". Rooney Mara was fearless in her portrayal of this antisocial, unpredictable, emotionally damaged and extremely intelligent young woman.On reflection, Craig's Mikael Bromkvist was the most disappointingly drawn character in the movie. Mikael telegraphs the ending after Lisabeth saves his life. She saved him from a horrendous death yet he was blasé about it almost tone deaf. I don't remember him even thanking her. Then she turns around and gives him what he wanted to accomplish in his book. Again the blasé response from him. The ending brings into question his sense of reality and the value of his own life. He blunders through his life with little concern for consequence. The character Mikael has no vision which might explain the meandering plot in the beginning. I'm not blaming Craig. He made the character quite believable.I certainly recommend the movie to adults. There are some hard, unforgiving scenes in this movie. The viewer will feel violated while watching the rape scene. Meaning, it was perfectly shot. Not for the faint of heart and certainly not for children. My favorite part of the movie is Rooney Mara's performance alone.

If I knew what I know now before I saw this movie, I probably would have waited until it came out on video and here's why...... I found much of the dialog hard to understand. Many times I found myself asking my girlfriend "what did he (or she) say?" I don't know if it was due to the theaters speaker system or if it was the quality of the sound recording but much of what I heard was not much more than a mumble. It would have helped if the actors could have spoken a little slower and/or clearer. With that being the case, I missed a lot of some key parts of the movie, thus losing track of what was happening. The other thing that affected my understanding of the movie was the fact that there were too many people/relatives to keep track of......who they were and how they were connected to the plot. In my opinion, this is the type of movie that requires seeing it two or three times to get a good understanding of what is actually happening. At least if you rent the movie, you can always rewind it and play it back if you didn't understand what the person was saying.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo didn't disappoint me.I felt it on par with original Swedish version.Rooney Mara was fantastic but not better than Noomi Rapace.Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross should never stop making the scores for Fincher, it was superb.However, is it necessary to remake a great movie and do it on the same level? Why not blow it outta the water?At least it wasn't a failed attempt. I may seem harsh, but I actually liked it quite a lot.4/5

Be prepared to have your annual "movies are never as good as the books" conversation with family and friends, because Stieg Larsson's worldwide best-seller "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" has come to theaters (this time without subtitles).Wanting to honor the beloved source material, Sony placed this American version in the hands of serial killer mystery expert David Fincher ("Se7en," "Zodiac") and Oscar-winning writer Steve Zaillian ("Schindler's List"). The move pays off, because "Dragon Tattoo" is about as good as it possibly could be given the challenges of the adaptation.The multi-faceted story deals primarily with Mikael Blomqvist (Daniel Craig), a journalist being sued for libel who temporarily steps down as his magazine's editor and quietly accepts an offer from a retired businessman named Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Under the guise of writing Vanger's memoir, he is to investigate the unsolved mystery of Vanger's missing/presumed dead niece, Harriet, a case over 40 years old. In need of help, he comes across Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a strange young woman with expert hacking skills who passionately takes up the job due to her own troubled past.Much like its Swedish predecessor, this adaptation strives to pack the bulk of the novel into a "reasonable" runtime without boring its audience to death. Zaillian compresses the hundreds of complex details of the cold case at the film's epicenter into easily digested chunks, yet merely having to do so always produces no better than satisfactory results. Oddly enough, saying the script doesn't derail the film or damage the story and its characters is the highest of compliments one can pay it in this case, and that's what it does.But it's Fincher who elevates this film, with no offense intended toward Niels Arden Oplev, director of the 2009 effort. Fincher is a master of his craft, and that means a considerable amount when dealing with a film so densely filled with plot points that other elements (like character development) can get lost.Although no adaptation of this novel could possibly convey the lengthy passage of time and the obsessive nature of Blomqvist's search for the truth, Fincher provides an abundance of tone, especially in reflecting the frigid temperatures of northern Sweden. He and his "The Social Network" and "Fight Club" cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth make it so every golden ray of sunlight on the desolate island feels as warm as it looks. Only directly blasting cold air on you from the back of your seat a la a "4D" theme park attraction would be more effective.The film's editing job is also top notch, overlapping audio and video to smooth over the exorbitant location transitions and maximize suspense in the scenes that cut back and forth between Lisbeth and Blomqvist. In fact, the movie finds its best groove in these scenes.Also crucial to depicting the book are the issues of graphic content, namely violence and sadism. After all, the translation of the original Swedish title is "Men Who Hate Women." Fincher embraces the book's sexual and disturbing nature as evidenced most basically in the marketing campaign. He also doesn't shy away in the film's most difficult scenes, giving them the brutal and sordid edge they require to honor the message of Larsson's novel. Although it feels wrong to call them tastefully done given the subject matter, it's true.Mara's performance mirrors Fincher's vision in many ways. There's no expectation of pity for Lisbeth, yet neither is she a hollow shell who completely bottles up her feelings. She bares it all in this film in every sense, giving herself to the performance. Rather than ham it up a notch to get some Oscar attention, she sticks with her interpretation of the character and makes for a rather unforgettable Lisbeth Salander.Craig is also a perfect Blomqvist, though his character lacked something distinctive, perhaps due to the script not giving him many moldable moments. A similar fate befalls many of the characters, which just emphasizes the need for Fincher's work and the talent of his actors all the more. Stellan Skarsgård as Martin Vanger, the current CEO of the Vanger Corporation, does perhaps the best job of utilizing his screen time to create a compelling character."The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a busy movie, and understandably so. Larsson's story deserves its integrity preserved the way it was in this version (only minor omissions and one major change), even at the cost of something that could have been more emotional and moving. Putting the book down and looking at this as a mystery/thriller, it's a consummate offering for the genre. Those unfamiliar with its source material will find it a bit slow at points and not as clean as a thriller written directly for the screen, but will still enjoy the payoff thanks to the professionalism of Fincher and Zaillian.A book and two movies later, rather than saying "the book is better," it should be said that "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" thrives the most in its original novel form. Some books lend themselves to film better than others — this isn't one of them. Given this movie took it out of its ideal state, its a good thing it turned out how it did.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com

(Spoiler alerts throughout) This film appears to offer a story of consequences and revenge; at least that is how it first appears. What it really offers is a platform for relentless gender assaults against men. (Spoiler Alert)For instance: after experiencing sexual molestation, the girl with dragon tattoo then visits the molester's home and when that turns out to be a mistake, returns a third time to affect revenge and to brutalize the molester. Does she see that justice is done? No. What she does is return to torture the man and release him right back out into the world where he can continue his behavior where she can then continue to brutalize him. The first time made him a villain and a fiend. I get that. The second time makes HER stupid and reckless while the third, premeditated visit, makes her a villain as big a villain as him.A short time later she comes onto Daniel Craig's character and then literally jumps on top of him against his wishes. No means no. Right? Not if your the girl with dragon tattoo. That's a double standard folks. Be smarter than this movie. Through the course of the story there were no men who were not emasculated or vilified. Frankly, I was horrified, as much by the gleeful reactions of some viewers as I was by the piteous actions of the story's unlikely protagonist.A far as the actual story telling. It was uninspired, milling back and forth between TGWTDT looking at her lap top and DC staring at photos. The problem is, who really knows what they were looking at and seeing. It was just boring. I know, you will say it was clearer in the book. But you know what? I didn't drop $10 to watch the book. I dropped the cash to see the film. I wish I didn't. I hope you don't either. If given the choice, watch Sharktopus instead. At least you will not be surprised by the quality.

Having read both the books and watched the Swedish version of the film, I did not have high hopes for the remade American version. I was concerned about how a big-budget, Hollywood style movie might take away from the rawness of the story. Turns out I had nothing to worry about.This American version is actually much more true to the book than is the Swedish version. The only major change from the book was that Blomkvist did not have sex with every single female character that showed up in the story (thankfully, the Swedish version left this out, too, because it was just ridiculous). Besides this, it incorporated many aspects of the book that were left out in the Swedish film. The result is a very long film, which may start to drag on for people who have never read the books, but which is certainly enough to satisfy fans. Despite being a somewhat flashier, higher-budget version, this version of the movie does a good job of incorporating a lot of the rawness of the story. There are plenty of horrifying, cringe-worthy scenes that are not censored anymore than the Swedish version (in fact, it almost seems as though Fincher was trying to be even more shocking).The acting and casting was superb. Daniel Craig is a perfect choice for Blomkvist; despite his previous macho hero roles, he does a great job in bringing out the vulnerability of his character. He is a relatively mild-mannered man who finds himself caught up in some dangerous situations. Although I don't feel like anyone can ever do any better than Noomi Rapace as Salander in the original movies, Rooney Mara certainly came very close with a much different style. Mara brings out a little more of the emotionality of Salander but still well mixed with the blank mask of a traumatized girl. The chemistry between Blomkvist and Salander is very well done in this movie - there is a certain warmth between Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara that was lacking in the Swedish version. Other notable performances include Christopher Plummer as Henrik Vanger (who borders on amusing when he talks about his family squabbles), Stellan Skarsgard as Martin Vanger, and Steven Berkoff as Frode.I did have a few minor issues with the movie. The accents were pretty poorly done. It felt as though the directors and the actors couldn't decide whether they wanted the characters to have accents or not. Some characters had part-time accents and others seemed to have no accent at all (Daniel Craig, in particular). I wouldn't really mind if none of the actors had Swedish accents since this is an English-language film but there is definitely a need to be consistent. Unlike other reviewers, I was not at all a fan of the soundtrack. Most of it hardly sounded like music to me - sort of just techno sounds half the time. The worst was the opening credits with really bizarre Gothic art and a song that just seemed very at odds with the rest of the movie.

...or you'll get lost as to what is being investigated in such great detail in a 40 year old missing?/murdered? person who done it case.Didn't read the books but it did remind me of a really good Agatha Christie novel I used to read back in the late '70's in high school except without the sadistic torture and provocative sex scenes.You'll appreciate the dark, cold and cozy ambiance of the entire movie that gets you to want to curl up in a warm bed with a hot toddy to read the very great mystery novel you're now watching as the movie unfolds to get you to focus on every character's quirky behaviors as a means of finding out who done it. Pay attention to the sidetrack hacking shenanigans presented as a clever way of getting back at someone through their bank account. Pay attention! It's really cool how it's done!This movie also has that sophisticated European foreign film feel that's so unlike the pacing of American movies. I kept asking is this what it's like in Sweden? Geez! Their welfare system really sucks as well. You'll see what I mean.This movie DOES take you to an alternate unsettling world of daily dysfunctional and abusive family life in another country with a history dealing with its own serial killer who's never been found for 40 years.I'ld have to say without a doubt Rooney Mara's performance is on line with Batman's Heath Ledger's "Joker" in the way they completely and totally become another person never seen before but is made to look quite real and unsettling. They both out do Brando and Dean in this respect. It's fascinating to watch an actor go that deep into a character with such realism. Don't know how they do it. Just watching that is worth the price of a movie ticket on top of the surprise ending to the who done it mystery.

How many people have seen a movie and then gone to read the book after? Strange, isn't it? After reading this book you don't have a wish to see the movie. Why? Because a book is great, better than any movie under that name(it doesn't matter if it is Swedish or Hollywood version). It is one of greatest action/thriller novels ever written and one movie can spoil all what you've seen in your imagination while reading that book. Movie may disappoint you in many ways if you compare characters from the book and those how David Fincher described them. It's not the same. I don't want to tell you anything about the book..., but you have to read it!

To my delight and surprise each film is better than the other. Where one version lags the other takes over...they should be seen as companion pieces.The acting is superb in every character!

David Fincher in recent years has grown to become one of America's best known directors working today. He has an interesting, oftentimes dark visual style that he features, and usually he has an interesting story to tell. Unfortunately, in this film, the story is just not interesting enough. It's kind of a typical murder mystery film, with some twists and turns, and an ending that really isn't too shocking. What raises this up from being completely mediocre is Rooney Mara's performance as the title character. Otherwise, this story here doesn't have enough weight or originality to stand out over other pretty good mystery films.Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist who's fallen out of favor after possible slanderous reporting. He is called upon by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), the ex- CEO of a company, to solve the mystery of his missing and presumed dead niece who disappeared 40 years ago. He ends up being partnered with an anti-social computer hacker, Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), who uses her skill and research to help solve the case. Mikael and Lisbeth ("The girl with the dragon tattoo") don't meet up until halfway through the film, and the first half features them each working separately. All the scenes in the first half of the film focusing on Lisbeth are very interesting. While Mikael gets immediately thrown into the main story, Lisbeth is given almost a character study (that furthers along the plot) for the first half of the film. Rooney Mara is really great here, giving the character layers, with such understated acting. The character is emotionally disturbed and apparently "crazy" but any trait is hidden beneath this straight and unflinching face. Daniel Craig's character, on the other hand, is not nearly as interesting, and for some reason, he mumbles here a lot, so he's also hard to understand at times. The mystery he's trying to solve is interesting conceptually, but visually it's often hard to convey excitement when he's sitting alone reading up on research.When the characters finally meet, about 75 minutes into this 160 minute behemoth, the mystery story gels a bit more, mainly because Daniel Craig finally has someone interesting to interact with. Where the film is lacking is largely in the story. The revelation at the end as to the connections of murders, and potential villains aren't that interesting. The resolution of the film must take darned near 30 minutes, and the main thing I took away from the film, was what a great performance Ms. Mara gave, and what an interesting character she played. The plot is by-the-numbers mystery, and the film does at times drag. David Fincher's direction is alright, but he doesn't make researching the murder much more than mundane. He throws in a few disorienting movements of the camera's placement, but other than that, this doesn't feel like a really great David Fincher directed film. It feels more like an O.K. mystery thriller, that has a great performance, some tense moments, and overall just kind of slips out of one's memory after a while. This film isn't bad by any means, it just doesn't have enough going for it to make it anything more than somewhat generic, other than the character of Lisbeth. It is overlong, though not bloated, and really not a lot could have been cut out without either cutting the story, or getting rid of good character scenes. The mystery is sort of interesting, but not nearly engaging enough. The final scene in the film was very good however, and mixed character development with a sort of sadness, giving the film a bittersweet feeling. The title character basically saves this film, and rises it above mediocrity, though not quite enough above.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 160 mins. R for violence, sexuality and brief nudity.

Having never read the book I went to see The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo without any preconceived ideas about the characters or how the story unfolds. I therefore realise that this film may not live up to expectations of the book fans but in terms of a piece of cinema this is definitely as good as Fincher's previous work. For those who have not read the book, the story portrays disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who is asked by ageing patriarch Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the murder of his favourite niece, Harriet. The titular character, Lisbeth Salander, (Rooney Mara) is originally hired to do a background check on Blomkvist but is eventually drawn into his intricate and dark investigation. As usual Fincher makes, what he can, fast-paced and thrilling but does find time for the heartfelt among the cut-throat action. Although the film is quite long it does not feel at all dragged out and overly long. Mara is absolutely fantastic as Lisbeth Salander and gives a delicate and vulnerable aspect to the otherwise hardened and vicious girl. Daniel Craig shows off his already established talent as Mikael and Plummer, with his limited screen time, takes centre stage and steals the spot light from his colleagues. The rest of the cast do well but most of the plaudits deserve to go to Mara. If you can stomach this fast-paced, gritty, dark and disturbing tale I urge you to go and see it not only because of Fincher's fantastic direction or Mara show-stopping performance but for the riveting and irregular ride you are in for.

I really liked this movie, had no idea what the story line was or anything about the movie other than my wife read the books. I think the job Rooney Mara did was amazing. I want them to develop more movies based on Lisbeth - was a great performance. Daniel Craig was as good as he has been in the other movies I have seen him in. Story line had me dying to find out what was going to happen next. The rape scenes were about as haunting a scene as I have seen in some time. Lisbeth was determined, tech savvy, strong, resourceful, but very human and didn't fall into the "superhero/unstoppable special agent category. The 158 minutes went by quickly and I am dying to see more of the story unfold. I hope they develop the next two books and more.

If you are going to watch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo film, watch the Swedish version that came out in 2009. The Swedish version is much better, with a good plot development and character development. If you go for the U.S. version expect to be bombarded by Coca-Cola and McDonald product placement. It's pathetic that U.S. audiences have to endure all this advertising. The U.S. version also seemed to add all the very violent and sexually-exploitive scene without developing the plot. The Swedish version has better suspense. Also the U.S. version did a horrible job of developing the story of Harriet. In the end I can't believe I paid money to see this movie again, as the U.S. version was truly of lesser quality than the Swedish version. Also the U.S. version was a bit less gory and sexually explicit.

I just saw the movie yesterday. I was hoping not to be disappointed after seeing all of the posters & teasers & trailers...and I wasn't. Having read all three books, my first glimpse of Rooney Mara as Salander led me to think "OH! She looks just like I imagined her too look!!!" It's like she jumped off of the pages of the book! Thank you David Fincher and everyone else involved for painting this movie so brilliantly and for casting it the way you did. INCREDIBLE! Daniel Craig, too is a perfect Blomquist (far more attractive than I imagined him to be! Thanks! Bonus+++). Whatever creative karma you all (people making the sequel) have going on PLEASE keep it up for the next 2 movies. I think it's a great film and a great story and a great tribute to a writer that died way too soon. BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!

Finally got a movie I could sink my teeth into, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo." One of the things I liked best was its length, which, like a book you find yourself drawn into, you feel delighted and look forward to spending some time with these characters and this story. The plot developed the leads separately, brought them together and then gave them time to interact and time to give a satisfying conclusion so we find out what finally became of the missing girl. So I was happy to sit and participate and see what would happen, like a satisfying mystery or spy story. And Rooney Mara is very hot as the female lead, showing her sexuality in a very natural and appealing way, at least for me. Not at all in a smutty way, even though the temptation must have been there. She plays a self-imposed outcast, not a misanthrope.And as for Daniel Craig, I disagree with Roger Ebert, that he comes across with the same confidence he showed as James Bond. In fact, like 'The Descendants,' where George Clooney allows the older daughter character to, at times, overshadow his character so that he really does come across as the clueless, feckless father, Craig also doesn't seem to demand the audience's attention be focused on him. Nor is he a particularly strong character – he never fights anyone; it is Dragon Girl who gets the chance to do damage to the villains. In fact, Craig's best qualities are the humanity and sense of character he brings to a role, without any melodramatics, exaggeration or heroics. He just allows us to sympathize with his character, as he did in 'Defiance.' So, overall, I was drawn to these characters and plot line – a satisfying film experience – 3 ½ stars of 4, an 8 stars out of 10.

David Fincher. 30-second spots strung together for 2 1/2 hours. As much as I love a beautiful scene, a quick, clever edit and Trent Reznor's edgy sounds all separate from each other, these elements together are not the way to tell this story – a complex one at that. Because today's youth, and by extension their parents, are so enamored with anything that is "quick," it has to be revered as a work of genius?Fast-cut MTV-style editing, like fast talking, does not make something good. Just because you, audience, could not follow entire sections of the plot doesn't make you dumb. It makes the director dumb.I give it a "3" for raw techniques, music, albeit totally misplaced and gratuitous. And a good performance by Rooney Mara.

Let me start off by saying that I went into this movie knowing next to nothing about its plot. I have never even picked up the book, and I never watched the Swedish version of the film, despite hearing enormous praise for both. With that being said, I was blown away with this movie. First and foremost, whether you like him or not, David Fincher makes good movies. You'd be hard-pressed to find a director that is more meticulous and intricate than he is. In the first hour of this movie, Fincher's extreme attention to detail is almost overwhelming. Not having any background knowledge of the story, I found myself struggling to keep up. I was lost with the story, I was confused about who these characters were, and to put it bluntly I felt totally in the dark. But the story reached its climax and Fincher shed light on it all. The story came together, I understood the nature of the characters, and I was impressed. All of a sudden, a story that I knew nothing about, made sense to me and I loved it. After the plot's unravelling I was totally glued and did not want the film to end. This isn't like most movies. Yeah, it's a murder mystery. Yes, it's a psychological thriller. And of course, it is ridden with gratuitous violence and sex. But it is also a love story. I went home and immediately watched the Swedish version, and I didn't feel the passion that I felt from Fincher's. It's true, Mara is not as "strong" or aggressive as Rapace, but that's what I loved. She's vulnerable. It was a remarkable performance on her part to capture the cold and ruthless side of Lizbeth, but at the same time expose the soft side as well. I think Mara has turned in the best female acting performance of the year, and I hope she receives the credit she deserves.I hope they complete the series because I'm riveted. I went again to only further appreciate the film's intricacies, and I can say that I'm hooked. This movie is well-acted, well-produced, and phenomenally executed. You will not be disappointed.

After the announcement that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was getting an English-language film treatment, I decided that the hype had built up to a point where I just had to read the source material for myself. Though it is not without flaws, Dragon Tattoo is an excellent story with the important mission of raising awareness concerning violence against women. Mere days after finishing the book I watched the Swedish film. The hype train had me excited for an outstanding thriller. The hype train let me down.I was left cold and somewhat irritated by the Swedish adaptation. A ton of important plot elements were left out, some were inexplicably added (Blomkvist's memories of the island became far too important and contrived), and Rapace felt all wrong as Lisbeth. She was brilliant and violent, but lacked the quiet pensiveness of the original character. She did not come off as autistic and emotionally disturbed, just bratty and rude. Worst of all, I was constantly confused by the extremely rushed, strange new take on the story. As a lover of foreign films, I normally grind my teeth when I hear that America is developing a remake. However, I found myself desperate for this one. I needed a movie that actually gave me the experience of reading the book for the first time, that made me care for Lisbeth and that truly disturbed me. Thankfully, the American adaptation (not a remake) delivered exactly what I was looking for. Those who say this version is unnecessary or a rehash must have seen a very different Swedish Girl with the Dragon Tattoo than I saw. The American take is jam-packed with scenes that were either skimmed or completely left out of the Swedish version. Yet, despite being more robust, the English- language Dragon Tattoo is incredibly paced, feeling less rushed yet hitting all the important plot points. The characters have time to develop and grow on you, the clue-finding makes more sense, and the killer is more horrifying. Screenwriter Zaillian knows exactly what to leave out and what to change (though the ending, which mirrors the book's ending, could have been arranged better). Craig, Mara, and even Plummer are spot-on in their roles and feel more fleshed-out as characters. Mara, in particular, inhabits Larsson's Lisbeth in a way Rapace did not. She captures Lisbeth's silent, borderline-autistic nature perfectly. Her fragile body and alien appearance even match the book's description. She allows herself to be vulnerable, but clearly regrets it over time. It's a captivating performance.If someone were to ask me, personally, which version to see, I would have to say without hesitation that this is the rare occasion where the American adaptation is superior. I did not think it was possible to stay so true to the story under three hours.

I have seen the Swedish films, yet not read the books. The US version is not a remake of the Swedish version; it is simply another adaptation of the novel. I must say I was very impressed with the pacing and over-all style and raw feeling of the US version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. The story, whether from the books, Swedish version or US version is quite a dark and winding journey. If you have not read the books or watched the Swedish versions I recommend now starting with the US version of the film. This US version will be the first of the trilogy; The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest.The opening credit sequence, as I'm sure many of you have heard is quite amazing. I loved it and all the work they put into it. It was very Bond like yet encompassed the dark complexities of this story and the film. This film is much more speedy than the Swedish versions. I found the Swedish films to be a little slow at times, which yes builds tension however the pacing of the US version is much more my speed. Very fast and smart.It is a murder mystery film, however it is also about the two main characters and their interactions and working together to solve a murder, or series of murders. I do not want to give anything away as the story and how it unfolds is what makes the movie run so well. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the US version is quite long. However it is a movie which you rather it not end due to the entertaining characters and the intense visual situations which you wish to look away from, but you can't.When it comes to the characters, I found that Rooney Mara played a much better Lisbeth than Noomi Rapace. And the interactions with Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) were great and at times quite funny. The two of them working together when they seem to be opposites was very entertaining and Daniel and Rooney pulled it off perfectly. As a huge fan of the new Bond reboots I have grown to love Daniel Craig and enjoy seeing him on the screen. He is a very talented actor and seems to give the audience what they want. Stellan Skarsgård, Christopher Plummer and Robin Wright also did a great job, as well as the other cast members. Each character was very carefully cast and bond perfectly to the heart of this film.The story, the acting, the directing; everything was perfect and I must say that director David Fincher is at the top of his game. For those who do not know, he directed Fight Club, Se7en, The Game, Zodiac, The Social Network, Alien 3, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Panic Room. The music, the ambiance, and the over-all dark feel to the film was so well done I couldn't believe it. I could not have asked for a better-crafted film. I am quite anxious to see the rest of the trilogy.

This was the movie that has been shoved in our faces as the next big thing for all this time?? I am always a little suspicious when something has to be sold so hard as a work of genius and in this case my suspicions were well founded.It cannot be denied that the leading lady gives a very fine performance but its wasted in this movie.There were times when I was appalled and repulsed, which I'm sure was the writers intent but it was pointless as I was never *involved*.I didn't care what happened next. There were times when I just wanted the movie to stop. At the end I just felt that I'd wasted my time watching this. Apparently the film's box office means that the sequels might not be made. Good. Let's hope it frees RM to do something more worthy of her talents than this rubbish.

If, like me, you've read the books and seen the Swedish adaptations you're probably itching to see what Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara and director David Fincher have got to offer. You won't be disappointed.Set in Sweden, the story follows journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) and his 'research assistant' Lisbeth Salander (Mara) as they attempt to solve an old murder case and, in the process, uncover some pretty dirty family secrets.Despite the epic running time (over 2.5hrs) this is a master-class in cinematic tension and it's even worse if you know what's coming – I spent most of the film poised to cover my eyes for the Bjurman/Salander scenes.Mara is outstanding as Salander. Her natural prettiness is just about disguised (all those piercings are real) and although she plays a more self-assured version of Salander, her social awkwardness still feels authentic.My only rant is over the accents. Craig doesn't even attempt a Swedish accent but everyone else is giving it a go. In every other way he has 'de-Bonded', but that accent Plus they've changed the ending, but I probably shouldn't tell you any more about that.@any_noise

*****MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO******I was watching this movie on a Christmas night. I had a long day and I wanted to relax and enjoy a movie with a large crowd. I do not know if I can say that I enjoyed this, per say. It was entertaining when they got to the mystery of the girl. But, I did not care much about the back story of the Girl with the Dragon tattoo. Don't get me wrong, Rooney Mara could not have been better, but I just did not like her character. I am one of those people who have not read the book, so I can not base it on how it was compared to the book. However, I can still judge the movie as it is, without comparing it to the book. It was a lot longer than it needed to be. There was about an extra 20 minutes of footage after the mystery that was solved, as it felt like it was trying to be longer than it needed to be. Daniel Craig was good as the Swedish mystery solver. I did not care much for his accent, though. It seemed as if it was going between a British and Swedish accent. Or, as I call it, a Switish accent. Rooney Mara, as I said, was brutally good in this. But there was something else brutal in this movie, that I thought was really unnecessary-The sex scenes. Rooney Mara is forced to have sexual relations in order to get money. One time she is tied down on a bed, while getting raped. Full nudity included. That scenes especially was so graph that I could not stand to watch it. It was so explicit that it basically seemed like porn. You see the man licking her behind, sticking his nose into her buttocks. I usually do read the parental guidance before going to see this movie, but I made the mistake of not. I did read, however, that the nudity was graphic, but I did not know that it was this graphic. This was NC-17 material. The scene felt like went on forever. Way longer than needed. I do not think that this is David Fincher's best in my opinion. I thought both the Social Network and Zodiac were far more better and entertaining. I thought this movie had potential but fell a little flat. I do not know whether I would have felt this way if I read the book or not, but I did not. So this was my end result coming out of the movie.

I read Stieg Larsson's entire Millennium Trilogy, and I recommend that people read the books before setting foot in a theater.Of course, movies never live up to books, and the way the reader imagines characters, scenes, plot development, storytelling tension, etc.As a standalone film, this film is OK, but I feel sorry for anyone who is not familiar with the trilogy and all of its story lines and intricacies. I don't know how anyone who has not read the books could possibly follow the plot line, or see the complexities of each character and their relationships to each other.I saw all of the Swedish films based on the books, and I'm still not convinced that the first Hollywood installment is any better than the Swedish version. The Hollywood version might be a bit slicker and bigger budget, and its screenplay might be a tad tighter, and more well written.All in all, though, I was not as blown away by the Hollywood version as I had hoped. The "corny" factor that was evident in the Swedish films seems to have been taken care of in the Hollywood version. But then you have the "weirdness" of accents used to convey "otherness" and "foreignness" to U.S. audiences.U.S. audiences may enjoy the newer version because we are biased toward movies filmed in English, and biased toward more well-known actors and actresses, i.e. Daniel Craig over Michael Nyqvist. It goes without saying that the Swedish films were more authentic.I will say this, though, Rooney Mara kicks ass as Lisbeth Salander, and I might even like her performance more than Noomi Rapace's. I didn't think anyone could top Rapace, but Mara may have just done that.Minor footnote: I really wish the producers had ended the film with another hard- charging Led Zep song.

When it comes to multiple adaptations of the same source, people will inevitably compare them to one another; they feel that they must in order to validate their opinions on which is ultimately superior. It happened with Martin Scorsese's The Departed and the Coen Bros. True Grit. This nonobjective way of thinking has hit David Fincher with his new film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. This is important to bring up because you will not witness such trivialities in this review. You will instead read a critique of this movie on its own merits. Viewpoints will not be bogged down by preconceived notions that "remakes" are inherently inferior to the original product. The desire for comparisons is wholly absent.David Fincher's ninth feature film sees him directing a second adaptation of the literary phenomenon, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, scribed by author Stieg Larsson. What started with his films Se7en and Zodiac is continued with another take on the procedural genre. Dragon Tattoo, however, fits more closely with the latter as it too features an investigative journalist driven by personal and emotional desires to solve a 40-year old cold case. Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), having lost credibility due to being convicted of libel, is called upon by an older gentleman (Christopher Plummer) plagued by a relative's untimely death. The request is simple: Blomkvist is to discover the murderer and reap the reward that will be bestowed upon him. Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), the identity of the woman the film's title refers to, goes about her daily routines to survive and is eventually thrust into the chaotic investigative world Blomkvist operates best in.Dragon Tattoo is perhaps Fincher's most brutal film, in terms of the violence and the subject matter. His work is usually riddled with cynicism and how the world revolves around the meaning of that term. That is still the case here, but it's taken to another level. As the original Swedish title of the novel suggests, there are men who really do hate women. This point is hammered into the audience very bluntly; there is no room for subtlety.Lisbeth Salander, portrayed exceptionally well by the once-lackluster Rooney Mara, is contrasted with the life of Blomkvist. While he attempts to rebuild his life and reputation, hers continues to decline as she suffers a personal tragedy with a relative that leads to a spiral of emotional and physical destruction. This contrast between Blomkvist and Salander is where the film shines the brightest. The investigation, while highly entertaining and intriguing, is second to the character work. We feel the pain both protagonists endure as they go about their routines before they eventually come together as one to solve the mystery of Harriet Vanger's unfortunate demise.The methodical nature of the film is on point. This is shown through the investigative techniques employed by our heroes. What's marvelous about the investigation is that we, as the audience, aren't the only ones scrambling to keep up with the plethora of names that play a role in the mystery. Blomkvist himself is taken aback by what he has to keep up with. Even the camera-work is used as an indicator of the laborious process in the investigation: the slow, fluid movement of a drive up to a mansion; the panning to a character reading copious amounts of paperwork; even close-ups on computers when new information is discovered. That's what makes Fincher's work in this genre brilliant: he utilizes everything to make the journey every bit as exhausting for his audience as he does for the characters.Dragon Tattoo isn't perfect, by any means. It's not even Fincher's best work. The problems that exist lie in the narrative after the climax. While it's still engaging, it seems to fall flat and doesn't resonate with what came before it. The audience is exhausted by the trials Salander and Blomkvist endure, and the abrupt ending, after a short cool down, is just as jarring as the abrupt introduction prior to the title sequence. The ending leaves something to be desired, namely that another installment should be on its way. That may happen over the coming years, but the abrupt ending coupled with wanting more is not a good thing.As noted above, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is not David Fincher's best work; that honor still belongs to Zodiac due to its impeccable narrative, suspense, and downright brilliant filmmaking by all parties involved. Dragon Tattoo is another worthy entry in the procedural genre that will be difficult to top by anyone else working within it. It and Zodiac will make for a wondrous double feature.

I just watched the Swedish version. Honestly, I feel cheated and misled. There's something fundamentally wrong with the story itself, a writer should know better. Think about it, the writer makes one of the characters claim that the girl was killed, which the audience believe, and then, the same writer, later reveals in the story that she is still alive? Hmmm, a best-seller? seriously? It's ethically wrong to mislead the audience just in order then surprise them in such a cheap way. Ain't going to watch the 2011 one, only from the trailer I can tell it's almost a duplicate of everything, as if the 2011 version was based on the 2009 version, they should rather make their own conclusions from reading the book and base the movie on that, not get impressions from a movie that was made about the same book! Should make necessary changes to the story first, change the plot.

I hope the sound editor never works again. For some reason, dialogue was over driven by music. And it wasn't even good music. The first scene, I struggled to figure out what they were saying. That should never happen, but it happens at least three times. The acting was very good. Rooney Mara was an excellent Lisbeth. Just one problem: Noomi Rapace was better. I feel bad comparing the two, but when you remake a film, you are going to have comparisons. If it wasn't for the sound, I would give it a 10, just like the original. There were a few plot changes. I'm guessing that US audiences wouldn't get the jail time for libel. It happens in Europe a lot more than the US. The ending was also different. Don't know which I prefer. Overall a good film. But, see the original as well.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a prime example of why you should pay attention to the messages a given movie is trying to send before heading willy-nilly into a theater. This is a film that is based upon a deeply disturbing series of books that spawned a deeply disturbing series of foreign films and which features the tagline, "The feel bad movie of Christmas." If you read between the lines here, I believe you should be able to make an educated guess as to the kind of movie this really is.Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist whose career appears to be over. After publishing a scathing expose on a powerful Swedish businessman, Blomkvist is sued for libel and is found guilty, a finding that will cost him his life savings, his reputation, and a short prison sentence. At a loss for what to do next, Blomkvist takes a meeting with Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), an aging but prominent corporate leader. Blomkvist is presented with a proposition that turns out to be more tempting that he could have ever imagined. Vanger promises to give Blomkvist the evidence he needs to clear his name and in exchange, Blomkvist will attempt to solve a mystery that has vexed the old man for 40 years: the murder of Harriet, Vanger's niece and favorite family member who went missing at the age of 16. With the help of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a socially stunted but immensely valuable private investigator, Blomkvist soon finds himself embroiled in a vast and complex cover up that threatens to consume every aspect of his life.To describe Dragon Tattoo as "rough" would require that you change the definition of the word. More like "exceptionally brutal" and "not at all something you'd want to see with your parents." I feel sorry for anyone who made the mistake of taking a post-Santa trip to the theater with the family without knowing for sure what they were getting themselves into. I was 14 when Titanic debuted and I had a number of friends who had their Christmas Day movie with the family ruined by the unexpected awkwardness of Kate Winslet's breast popping up on the screen. Dragon Tattoo is approximately one hundred thousand times worse. Even the opening credits are a bit demented (though visually stunning) and that's just a sample of the brutality that follows. Dragon Tattoo is about as raw as it gets for a mainstream movie and despite the fact that I had read the book and knew what to expect, it still made me squirm more than once.If you can get past the cringe factor, Dragon Tattoo is a quality but ultimately flawed film. Director David Fincher put together a fantastic cast filled with actors who fit their roles perfectly. Led by Craig's usual calm and understated demeanor, the performances within this film are strong to quite strong, though none compare to the work of Rooney. I don't think this is an Oscar-caliber portrayal but it is certainly one that will move her to the top of the list for a number of high profile roles over the next few years. And as always with a Fincher film, the technical aspects of Dragon Tattoo are exquisite. From the score to the shot selection, this is barely a step down from The Social Network, which was nearly perfect from a behind-the-camera standpoint. Fincher uses every element like it belongs to his directorial Swiss army knife, heightening the intensity here, providing subtle detail there. Fincher is the master of creating imperceptible tension within each audience member, building it until you suddenly realize that you're sitting on the edge of your seat and your heart is pounding. In this regard, Dragon Tattoo provides the perfect subject matter.But where the film struggles is in the way Fincher tries to tell a convoluted, web-like story. In the book, author Stieg Larsson weaves together several stories that don't initially seem to connect in the beginning and he does so in excruciating detail. It is a slowburn of a read but one that I found compelling. In order to present every concept within the book, however, Fincher makes the mistake of jamming almost every ounce of story from the source material into the film. The first third of the movie, then, moves at a rapid pace that doesn't fit the story, the characters, or even the actors. There's a hint of Aaron Sorkin in the dialogue but it doesn't contain the expert craftsmanship that usually accompanies a Sorkin script and it doesn't fit Craig's brand of subdued acting. Moreover, Fincher tries to pack an excessive amount of information into the first act and none of it connects very well. As a result, we get a number of short, choppy scenes that don't flow together and make it quite difficult to settle in. I'm a big fan of Fincher overall but I think Dragon Tattoo displays his limitations, or at least his weaknesses. Far from Fincher's master work, it is nonetheless an intriguing and worthwhile film that you may not want to take in on a full stomach.

Based on the best-selling YA novel, The Maze Runner is the newest, and  one of largest adaptions to arrive in cinemas yet. Comparable to The  Hunger Games and Twilight, it is in fairly good chances to be the next  big franchise. Here is what we thought of it;  Setting the tone immediately, lead star Dylan O'Brien awakens suddenly  in a very dark and eerie lift travelling from deep below the ground, it  becomes apparent that he now knows just as much as we do. The fear is  visual and quite real  and just like a young child on our first day of  school we are pushed into a new, confusing experience for the next two  hours.  Arriving atop the lift and unable to remember anything other than his  name, Thomas. He is told by a group of teenage boys that he is in a  field in the centre of a maze, called the 'Glade', where they all live.  Having attempted to find a way out many times, all they know is that  the maze is open during the day-time, and closed at night where it  periodically changes and is protected by fearsome creatures called  'grievers'. Anyone in there at that time has never returned.  Much like an episode of Lost meeting The Lord of the Flies meeting  Labyrinth, we understand narrative at the same time as Thomas, who is  eventually told that three years ago a young teenage boy first arrived  at the glade, and each month since one more arrives in the lift with  certain supplies to survive. Unknowing of why and unable to escape they  have become helplessly trapped there since. Similarly to The Lord of  the Flies, the group of boys, all probably aged 10-20 have creating a  living-area, created rules, swearwords and the imperative code to  'never go beyond those walls' - but as Thomas arrives at the glade all  seems to change for the worse, and many of the other 'Gladers' take  note.  Admittedly we had not read the book until after we had saw the film,  but from the very first paragraph we noted its book-to-screen accuracy.  Fans of the book will be more than satisfied with the minimal changes,  and any made are for the better.  The film, upheld by a ninety-nine percent teen cast, feels news and  many of the actors are in roles unseen before. Dylan O'Brien, From TV's  Teen-Wolf, provides an exceptional lead role as Thomas and carries the  film in both story and emotional trawls. Although new to the setting  and with the films entirety taking place over just a few days, he  comfortably fits in, although ruffling many traditions too. At one  point it is said 'I don't know if he is brave or stupid, but we need  more of him'.  Co-staring alongside Dylan O'Brien are equally exceptional performances  by; Will Poulter, in a dark tough-guy role, (and absolutely nothing  like his recent role as Kenny in We're The Millar's); Thomas  Brodie-Sangster stars as a fellow Glader; and Kaya Scodelario in a  surprise turn-up as the first female at the Glade - but also 'the last  one ever' to arrive. Although the narrative between them is conflicting  at times, the chemistry is smooth as if friends both on-and-off the  screen. Notably, we can confirm that the characters live-up the book  creations and are almost perfectly cast.  Evidentially former director/writer/editor/effects maestro, Wes Ball  uses skills from his previous work on this film and it shows and flows  evenly. Take note future producers, this is how to successfully make a  YA adaption, which surprisingly, is just as impressive as the book. Yet  unfortunately leaves us with far more questions than answers by the  end. Based on the trilogy by James Dashner expect more answers to  follow in sequel movies in the soon to be massive franchise. Or, you  know  you can read the books before hand? Ultimately, you do not have  to be a fan of the books, or even a YA to enjoy the film it, it has  something for almost everyone.  The Maze Runner arrives in US cinemas 19th September, and UK cinemas on  10th October. Be sure to check back soon and read our exclusive  interview with director Wes Ball, and leading cast; Dylan O'Brien, Will  Poulter and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Brace yourselves Maze Runner fans!

It's rare for a big movie studio to trust the future of a potential blockbuster franchise to a brand-new director. You'd imagine that there would be just too much at stake when it came to translating James Dashner's series of best-selling dystopian novels to the silver screen. But it's easy to see why Wes Ball got the job - with this one film, he graduates from short films to blockbuster movies with flair to spare. Indeed, The Maze Runner is such a cool, confident and thrilling blend of action beats and character work that it's hard to believe Ball has never before commandeered a full- length feature film. It's true that the narrative gets a little away from him by the end, making less sense as more secrets are revealed. But this is more a problem with the source material than Ball's own skills as a director.Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) finds himself thrust rudely into the world of the Glade: a community of boys who have figured out how to live while encircled by a giant, constantly changing maze, within which dwell giant, boy-eating monsters known only as Grievers. Many of the boys, including benevolent pioneer Alby (Aml Ameen) and champion of the old ways Gally (Will Poulter), are content with just surviving day to day. Thomas winds up unsettling the entire camp with his refusal to follow the rules and determination to ask questions: he wants to explore the Maze with designated runners like Minho (Ki Hong Lee), and figure out a way to get free. Life in the camp gets more complicated when, weeks before the next boy is due to be sent up to the Glade, a girl in the form of Theresa (Kaya Scodelario) arrives instead.There's a lot of blockbuster potential to be squeezed out of this premise, and Ball does so quite wonderfully. The Maze encircling the Glade is a stonily grey, massive enclosure, and the Grievers - when the boys encounter them in increasingly close quarters - are odd marvels made as much of machine as flesh. Ball cuts scenes of great, heart-stopping tension together masterfully: whether it's Thomas running through walls that are fast closing in on him, or Thomas and Minho trying to outrun a Griever while burdened with an unconscious Alby.The film even finds some welcome dramatic depth in this strange little community of lost boys in the Glade - Thomas' growing antagonism with Gally is balanced against the mutual respect he and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) develop for each other, and the brotherly connection that he forges with the adorable Chuck (Blake Cooper). The politics of the situation is fascinating as well: as much as The Maze Runner is about, well, running for your life in a giant maze, it also raises big questions about identity and integrity. Is safety and security worth giving up your right to information and choice?What works less well is the secret around which the Glade is constructed. As viewers, we aren't given a whole lot of answers about why the Glade and the Maze exists, nor do we get many explanations as to why Thomas is so different and insatiably curious. But the ones we do get - all centred around the mysterious, severe figure of Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) in some kind of control centre - oddly render the film and its characters less, rather than more, interesting. It's a strangely deflating experience to have the film's rich ethical dilemmas and intense action sequences give way to an underlying dystopian narrative that isn't really all that compelling.Nevertheless, The Maze Runner remains quite an accomplishment. It's an assured, impressive debut for Ball, one with enough electric tension and moody drama to intrigue throughout its running time. His young cast is fully capable of carrying their own weight, with Poulter - morphing from comic sidekick in We're The Millers into hateful adversary here - the standout. Its story collapses a little into itself as it hurtles towards its climax, but Ball's work is quite enough to leave viewers excited by the prospect of the inevitable sequel.

I just saw The Maze Ruuner, OMG!!!! It was so amazing, it's a good thriller action film. I read the whole saga, i'm a fan. But as every film adaptation, there are things that you can't put on screen for different reason, like runtime or the rhythm of the story. But, this was a great movie. The performances were right, the Maze is so complex and the Grievers are awful as hell! The film transmit all these feelings of suspense and danger. You don't have to read the book to get the story,if you don't want, of course there's gonna be little things that are gonna be left unanswered because it's a Big story of 3 books, but the film introduce the story to new people. It's male power and it's working!!!!!

Before i start the review i would just like to say i have not read the book and i can not do a book to film analysis, sorry for any inconvenience. This is a spoiler free review. The Maze Runner is directed by Wes Ball and stars Dylan O'Brian, Kaya Scodelario, Will Poulter and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. The Maze Runner is based off of James Dashner's novel by the same name. The movie is about a boy named Thomas that wakes up in an elevator. Thomas's memory has been erased and the only thing he can remember is his name. Thomas wakes up in what is known by the local populace as The Glade. In The Glade the boys that live there (called Gladers) have created a home for themselves with structural rules and where everyone does their part to help out. The main people are the runners, these people are the ones that run out into the maze and try to find an escape route and attempt to map it out. But they soon begin to realize its more than a maze. The first two acts of this film were absolutely amazing, Wes Ball really knows how to bring tension into this film especially in the chase and Griever sequences were you feel a lot of awe and suspense as you watch the characters run in and around corners from the Grievers and the maze itself. The biggest problem about this film however is the last act, the last act was just absolutely terrible and totally ruined the experience for the entire movie. Another problem was all of the cliché's and predictability throughout the movie which took me out of the experience constantly. There are some really nice action scenes in this movie with great camera angles that truly capture the suspense and excel the experience, there is also unfortunately 3 scenes i noticed with shaky cam though which again took me out of the experience. Most of the actors are generally unknown but the acting was alright with no one really pulling an amazing performance or even something noteworthy, however Kaya Scodelario's character has this Kirsten Stewart look to her which was kinda annoying. The main character played by Dylan O'Brian was alright however in some parts of the film his acting became more like Shia LaBeouf's in transformers. Will Poulter's performance was probably the only good one in the entire movie as i truly felt that he portrayed his character really well. The VFX teams deserve some recognition for their work on capturing the shear size and terror of not only the giant walls but also the terrifying scary grievers. The walls are massive, frightening, unpredictable and scary. The grievers on the other hand are better left not talked about believe me the less you know the better. I would recommend you go see this film, its actually quite good maybe even a bit underrated. Its a fun and enjoyable film to watch but under the surface its an okay film with a high predictability/cliché rate. I'd recommend you see this film with a bunch of friends to possibly enjoy the experience more because when you look at it from an entertainment point of view this film defiantly delivers, but when you look at it from a critique point of view you'll slightly less enjoy the film for what it is. My score 7.5/10 or ★★★

There has been a recent wave of movies adapted from Young Adult (YA) literature, containing similar settings and characters. Dystopian society – check (The Hunger Games and The Giver). Teenagers abandoned in a fight or die arena – check (The Hunger Games). Main character finds himself/herself thrown into a new world – check (The Mortal Instruments). With such tough competition, the Maze Runner is given a difficult task to move away from the rest of the YA movies and shine.On paper, The Maze Runner sounds similar to the hugely popular The Hunger Games series, where teenagers are sacrificed by the adult controllers, and thrown into an arena or maze without any assurance of survival. That said, the similarities end there. Instead of hunting each other down, the emphasis on cooperation and living in a cohesive society can be seen in The Maze Runner, which puts the movie in good stead of differentiating itself.Like the film's main lead, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), the audience is plunged into darkness as the film starts. Coupled with the shaky camera, flashing lights and clanking of machinery, the film attempts to make the audience feel Thomas' disorientation and fear, before the cage Thomas is trapped in comes to a grinding halt. Thomas is 'retrieved' from the cage by a group of hostile, rowdy boys, and is welcomed to the Glade by being thrown to another cage.Fans of the book might be disappointed as the film apparently departs a fair bit from the original. This writer has not read the original, and has no idea what the movie was about except for the information provided by the trailer. Being thrust into this new world like Thomas, it was admittedly hard to keep up with the terms used (e.g. "Grievers", "Gladers", etc.). However, the fast pace of the movie meant that what was lost through the quick dialogue and name-dropping was quickly learnt during the film (spoiler: Grievers are oversized mechanical spider-like creatures), as the series of events quickly familiarises the viewer with the world within the Glade.The society within the Glade was emphasised right at the start, with the typical characters to be expected for a film containing such a large number of men-boys. Alby (Aml Ameen) is the magnetic, de-facto leader, and first person to ever inhibit the Glade. Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) is second in command, who was thrown out of power when Gally (Will Poulter) usurps the power in the Glade. Lastly, there is also the protagonist's sidekick – Chuck (Blake Cooper). The actors were convincing in their roles but not outstanding, perhaps except for Newt. Brodie-Sangster's portrayal of Newt's weakness and lack of confidence as a new leader was commendable, especially when the character was first thrust into power and caught between Gally and Thomas. There is also character development, noticeably in Minho, shown to forsake his friends right at the start, and ends up saving Thomas eventually.O'Brien's protagonist is then, unexpectedly, the most predictable of the lot – the game-changing, hot-headed newcomer to the Glade. Thomas is central to the story right from the start, questioning conventions, being the only person Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) knows, and finally, leading the Gladers to conquer the maze. Without such a figure tearing apart social norms, the story would admittedly not progress and the movie would not reach its conclusion. However, this is no excuse for O'Brien's lack of emotions in the character. The only girl of the male-dominated Glade, Teresa, lacks screen time, but holds her ground whenever she is given the opportunity to, which is appreciated in a film overcrowded by male teenagers.Not to discount YA literature (this writer is a fan of YA fiction), but parts of the film does seem clichéd at times, with jokes targeted at a younger audience. Thankfully, the film's fast-moving plot and storyline does more than make up for this, leaving the audience at the edges of their seats, not knowing what will turn up at the next corner (literally and figuratively).Towards the end of the film, the film asks questions of which is a wiser choice – staying in familiar territory or exploring unchartered waters. While there are no prizes for guessing which option is the preferred one here, the more pertinent question is what lies beyond the maze, bringing into mind a quote from the Hunger Games, "there are worse games to play". The characters do not get to find out, and the end of the film also unabashedly advertises for its sequel, The Scorch Trials, which is currently in pre- production.

This movie feels a lot like the Hunger Games mixed with the Lord of the Flies, so the concept and content is already a winner but the pacing is awful. We don't get a chance to feel the boys' relationships grow. Things happen too fast in a way that makes the it hard for me to feel empathy and emotional attachment to the characters, rather than making the movie more exciting.The acting is not that great-the lead is very stiff and unnatural in many parts of the movie, and the curly haired kid's death was badly acted as well. Kaya was not that believable in this movie too, and neither was the blonde scientist. However, the concept and execution of the maze was very nice to watch. I had to strain my eyes badly to make out what was happening during the night scene when Grievers attacked, but otherwise I found the movie quite visually appealing.I'd say this movie is worth watching and is a good way to pass time, but I am still a bit disappointed by the execution. The director had a great story to work with but didn't make it come through that well. Between this and the Hunger Games, I'd say HG beats this in all aspects.

i just watch this movie and its so amazing in terms of concept and the characters, I'm suggesting everyone to watch it. :)this is info i read from wikipedia before i watch it:he Maze Runner is the first book in a young-adult post-apocalyptic science fiction trilogy of the same name by James Dashner.[1][2] The novel was published October 2007 by Delacorte Press, an imprint of Random House and is being made into a 2014 major motion picture by 20th Century Fox. The novel spawned two sequels: The Scorch Trials and The Death Cure.James Dashner has also written a prequel to The Maze Runner entitled The Kill Order, that came out in 2012.[3]

Fox thinks that they might generate the same hype as what Lionsgate did for The Hunger Games, though it looks pretty decent, it never comes any closer to Katniss' revolution. It is properly story-driven and undeniable an intriguing young adaptation without any annoying unnecessary stuffs, changing the idea of Hunger Games with a maze and end the story just like Cabin in the Wood except that with some proper explanation do not really contribute to make the film looks brilliant, but more on recycling the same idea. When the film starts to break out to find an exit from the creepy and horrifying maze, the twisted ending is not really surprising but more to the mindset of the studio that they hint to produce more sequels. However, the performance of the young casts are good and the strong scores have actually made the adventure looks extremely thrilling.

The Maze Runner is another Young-Adult book-to-film adaptation that offers a great deal of suspense, mystery and excitement with many lives are at stake. The film asks us which is the better choice – choosing to stay in our own personal comfort zone where we feel safe or we brave enough to take a leap of faith to face the unknown and search for a better path. It essentially encourages us to dare to be different in a world that wants us to conform...we should continue to expand and push ourselves to do more. Without knowing anything about the book, The Maze Runner does feels familiar in some ways and it gives the feeling that we have all seen this before (very similar to The Hunger Games, Divergent or The Giver).Based on the novel of the same name by James Dashner, The Maze Runner is about a group of young teenagers or kids who are trapped in a place called The Glade, the center of a giant maze, without any memories of their previous lives. Every month, each and every one of them wakes up in a caged elevator that comes with supplies. Some of them have been there for years and they've set up some ground rules that everyone must abide in order to live harmoniously and co-exist peacefully together. The Glade is surrounded by huge walls that only has one opening that leads to the giant maze and it closes every night. In order to escape, they send out runners to explore the maze in order to find a way out. However, there are mysterious, dangerous creatures called the "Grievers" that come out at night to hunt for food and the runners must ensure that they're back before the maze closes every night. The runners have been doing that for years, but still unable to find a way out, until Thomas appears.As with many other Young-Adult protagonists (similar to Katniss in The Hunger Games, Tris in Divergent, Jonas in The Giver), Thomas is different from the rest. He's curious, questioning everything around him and willing to do whatever it takes to seek and find answers. Not to mention, he's brave enough to lead the Gladers to conquer the maze. We're also introduced to Gally, another similar antagonist that doesn't like change, who wants everyone to strictly abide by the rules so that everyone can co-exist peacefully.The first act of the movie is incredibly promising, compelling and suspenseful enough to keep viewers interested, with enough drama, mystery and tension building up in the second act. However, everything goes downhill as soon as the third act begins. The revelation in the third act is considered a huge letdown considering the thrilling, suspenseful set-up earlier in the film. Who is Thomas? Why he's the most 'promising' of them all? Who sent him here? Why 'they' sent Thomas and Teresa? What is The Maze? Why they're all trapped in the Maze? What are the "Grievers" actually? How on earth that guy (I won't spoil it for you) managed to escape and meet them at the end? The explanations are vague...the film doesn't provide clear answers for many of the questions poised earlier in the film at its conclusion and relies on the next sequel to answer them instead (some of them I highly doubt so).Furthermore, the film never takes the time to explore its characters further and makes you care about them. The actors were convincing in their roles by providing decent performances but none of them were outstanding enough to make a deep impression. The friendship and camaraderie between the Gladers are shown throughout the film, but less profound. The only girl in the Glade, Teresa, lacks screen time and she serves no purpose for being in the film. You won't feel anything missing if she's completely removed from the story, because her role doesn't seemed to affect the overall plot of the film (there's enough suspense in the connection between Thomas and Teresa but that's not fully answered at the end of the film, so the only way to explain her inclusion in the film is probably that she's an important character in future instalments). The development of the characters felt rushed and truth be told, I didn't feel any emotional connection to the characters at all.Moreover, there are no memorable moments or impressive action in the entire film. As soon as the "Grievers" appear on-screen, all you see are just a bunch of closeups, fast cuts and blurred, shaky action. For me, it is hard to tell what is going on most of the time. Overall, The Maze Runner is suspenseful and exciting at the beginning, but it fails to deliver a dramatic and satisfying pay-off to the audience after all the patient waiting in hope to finally see everything comes together in the end.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/09/movie-review-maze-runner.html Rating: 6.5/10

Again as is the present trend derived from "Hunger Games", "Divergent", "The Giver" and many more, "The Maze Runner" yet another young-adult post-apocalyptic science fiction novel of the same name by James Dashner, published in October 2007. It has two sequels in its trilogy: "The Scorch Trials" and "The Death Cure". I haven't read the books yet, so I will just be judging the film as it is.The film starts with a boy who wakes up in a rapidly-rising elevator, which opened in a camp of teenage boys called the Glade. The boy eventually recalls that his name was Thomas, but nothing else from his past. being the main character, Thomas, of course, differed from the other boys. He was more curious about what lies beyond the Glade, and more determined to regain his freedom. The Glade was surrounded by a giant maze which the other boys had been trying to figure out for the three years that they have been there. However, the maze changes its configuration every night. Furthermore, there lives in the maze unseen deadly creatures called "Grievers". Why are these boys in the Glade? Will they ever get out of there? What does the arrival of a girl named Teresa in the Glade signify?The situation of the teenage boys trying to survive with each other in the Glade without any adult supervision is very much reminiscent of a much earlier young adult classic "Lord of the Flies." We also see here the usual ingredients in this genre: the enclosed arena, the stringent rules, the unknown outer limits, rebelling against establishment. This is one of those rare summer blockbuster films for which I did not know ANY of the actors by name. There may be familiar faces but they were not household names. The lead actor Dylan O'Brien does well in his role but it was really outstanding in any remarkable way. I was glad to see an Asian actor Ki Hong Lee in a major role as the original runner Minho. I just don't know if his book character was as non-proactive as it was portrayed on screen. I have to say though that the action sequences were done quite well. The running within the maze scenes were quite exciting and very entertaining to watch. For all the tension built up in the film though, the hanging ending could be quite a disappointment. Nothing really gets explained clearly. While this one will feel like an incomplete film, it makes the sequels must-sees for those who are interested enough to see the story through. However, honestly, after the excellence of the film version of "The Hunger Games", with a big star Jennifer Lawrence in the lead, all of these similar genre films that followed its lead already pale in comparison. For me, "The Maze Runner" just felt like another young adult dystopian film too many.

The appeal of the The Maze Runner for its billion dollar genre is how straightforward everything it seems. It (thankfully) doesn't begin with a voice-over narration, because indeed it's another high concept that designs a world as a mind-bending game. The film already faults for spilling too much rules and details, but when things starts actually moving, the action becomes marvelous, with large scaled, suspense driven set pieces that easily makes it worth the price admission. The worst of it however is when it finally unfolds all of the hidden secrets, compromising much of the potential of this ride. Still, it's pretty hard to deny the excitement of the experience alone. Treating it as another solid action film might be enough for a while.Things are stronger at the first act when the hero is just picking up information even though the people around him are basically just over-explaining stuff rather than developing their characters. But it's great when it keeps the plot moving from one place to another. Once they get into the maze, the momentum becomes a heartbeat. It works like a certain video game that has its heroes risk through various obstacles, brimmed by conspicuous fortitude. It is a great example of a real action film that relies more on the matter of life and death thrills, even if you're already surrounded by nice production and special effects. There's also an hint of social analogy to fit the genre's trend of playing with politics, except the one here seems simple and intriguing to figure out what it is trying to pinpoint. Everything else is just more scattered clues for the mystery.But all of those growth suddenly gets bogged down once it hits to their biggest answers. It's obviously setting up for another young adult franchise, but it also hurts to whatever it has put together. At this point, it feels like we're left hanging with more questions, except it's much nonsensical. To be fair after this large disappointment, we're still given a totally fun cinematic experience. The direction is so energetic at its tension, it almost seems to have inspiration some of the greatest horror movie aesthetics and tricks: the ooze, the meat, the traps, the dark walls, and the singular angled chase scenes with the enemy coming closer to the hero. Those are some of its remarkable, well-shot bits that you don't always see in this dull genre. The acting is also good for outweighing what's written for the characters. Dylan O'Brien looks like a hero to root for and he does a fine job for it. Will Poulter also shines as his reasonably arrogant opposite.The best thing The Maze Runner could offer is the maze itself, though those spectacle couldn't help us ignore the final minutes of the film, but it still overpowers the overall experience. Personally, I would rather look forward more on a video-game adaptation (if it's even possible) than the sequels, but I don't know. It's pretty hard to see where this story is going. It instantly compromises some larger picture beneath the surfaces.for the sake of being another million dollar franchise, but this one has a direction of its own, despite that their destiny seems to lack the freshness. The cleverly constructed action just adds the value, otherwise.

If you ain't scared, you ain't human.As a fan of The Maze Runner series I got to say that there are many changes in the movie which I think is necessary because of course you'll notice that usually movies runs from 1 up to 2 hours long only...so what do you expect? (this is actually for those whiners who didn't have a clue) Besides I think that those changes makes the maze and the Grievers (a bio-mechanic monster) much more dangerous.Main Casts was actually great for me. I'm familiar with Thomas Sangster (Newt), Will Poulter (Gally), Kaya Scodelario (Teresa) and Patricia Clarkson (Ava Paige) since I have seen their other movies before. Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) though was new to me, I've heard that his from Teen Wolf which I don't watch, but I was actually surprise with his acting performance in this film, it actually pretty good. Another newcomer is Ki-Hong Lee plays Minho which until now I don't know whose famous scientist he was named from. The movie experience as a whole was incredible, it was heart- pumping and wicked! I am already excited for second installment The Scorch Trial because that is craziest part of the series besides I would love to see those Cranks in horde too.And if you guys saw the film but didn't read the book, I think you should read it.

The Maze Runner is a 2014 action/sci-fi film in which a teenager named Thomas wakes up to find himself without any memory of who he is, and in a small colony surrounded by a dangerous maze known as "The Glades". Maze Runner as I will call it really surprised me, I was expecting a sub-par action flick with annoying characters and teen drama, but to my surprise it had very little of that! It's a well acted and thrilling film with more upsides than down.Maze Runner itself if very reminiscent of Lord of the Flies, and just like the book, the characters are the main selling points. The characters are both beautifully written and acted, but the supporting characters are the real meat of the film. The characters make level-headed and surprisingly smart decisions, and when a struggle occurs it's not out of nowhere, you understand why the characters would make these decisions. But in my opinion, the best part of the film is the maze itself. The special effects and design of the maze is both beautiful and creative that disorientates you just as much as the characters.But, sadly this isn't a perfect film. The character of Thomas is under-developed and dry, the maze could have been utilized a bit more, and the character of Chuck is both annoying at times, and poorly acted. But honestly, it's still a really enjoyable film that has the potential to be a really great trilogy.

I watched the movie and was like OO ... had never been so nervous and full of expectations as I was! what about the chuck ??? too cute, those roses cheeks, give willingness to tighten and focused enough in their relationship! I was rather disappointed with the rapidity of information to the viewer moves that may seem very confusing, especially for those who have not read the book. Had many scenes that will only understand if you read the book ... so did not discourage me and that final left a wanting more !!! especially with the next race will be in the desert and more overwhelming. Hyper, mega excited about the next movie ... I found little time to explain everything, but you certainly will not leave disappointed cinema. It's good fun for the family. READ the book and you shall put away all doubt;)

The film keeps a strong pace and the storyline and acting is excellent. Edge of your seat stuff. Worth watching more than once. Cannot fault the film anywhere. The maze was stunning and nothing looked out of place. The story captures you from the start and does not let go. Absolutely no boring parts. The special effects did not detract from the storyline and the story itself is substantial enough to keep you guessing. Just wanted to watch more. Where it differs from other films in the genre is simply good story writing that is not one dimensional as most films tend to be dumbed down. Not simplistic but not complicated either. Everyone got it right with this one and it was a joy to watch.

Skewed and Reviewed's Sasha Glenn gives thoughts on The Maze Runner and how it compares to The Hunger Games over at sknr.net.The Maze Runner is 20th Century Fox's attempt at the current trend in Hollywood to cash in on Young Adult-themed science fiction in a dystopian setting. Coming off the heels of hits like The Hunger Games and Divergent, The Maze Runner is the first story in the trilogy of novels by James Dashner. As such, I thought I would use this review space to compare this first film in the trilogy to another. The Maze Runner versus The Hunger Games (self-titled, not Catching Fire) sorry Divergent, I haven't seen you.DIRECTORS The Maze Runner's Wes Ball vs. The Hunger Games' Garry RossThe Maze Runner is Wes Balls first major motion picture, but you wouldn't know it because the visuals and pacing are fantastic.Garry Ross, on the other hand, directed both Pleasantville and Seabiscuit prior to The Hunger Games. Both great movies, however this slow thoughtful style I feel was not the best choice for the action-paced-with-thought story of the hunger games. Guess that's why he was replaced for Catching Fire, which is a superior film.Advantage: The Maze Runnerfor more, visit: http://sknr.net/2014/09/19/maze-runner/

Less than a half hour into 2014's The Maze Runner (my first review of the fall season), the character of Alby (Aml Ameen) says to the main character of Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), "you're not like the others, you're curious". Absotively boss! Absotively! That's the central theme about what's going on here. A confused young gent is catapulted into a dystopian future and unbeknownst to everybody else, wants to change things and break the cycle. Now in all fairness, I hadn't read the series of original books by which this flick is based upon. But as I diligently watched what inhabited the screen, I realized that it reminded me of so many other films that I threatened to make a list. Here's a few that I remember: "Runner" seemed reminiscent of 1990's Lord of the Flies (themes of savagery and the forming of a tribal society), Cabin in the Woods (the whole behind the scenes feel where governmental workers at a hidden station, are manipulating everything and everyone through the use of hidden cameras), 1997's Starship Troopers (there are bugs in a large maze that kill people and they're similar to the ones in Troopers), and 1997's Cube (all the characters wake up in an unknown place, don't know each other, and must find their way out of evil, deadly traps and such). Now am I condemning "Runner" because of these factoids? Not really. This ultimately wasn't the reason for my condensed, two and half star review.Featuring cinematography that has the look of a 90's Pink Floyd music video and filmed primarily in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, The Maze Runner begins with young Thomas aka "Greenie" (played Dylan O'Brien). As the proceedings first come to light, he's traveling upward in a rundown elevator that ends up surfacing towards a grassy field (with a huge corridor-like structure wrapped around it). When this elevator stops, he finds himself taken in by a bunch of other teenagers. They let him know that he's trapped (along with them) in a location (the Glade) which harbors no escape of any kind. I mean, there is a way to get out, but it involves hightailing through an enormous maze where at night, evil bug- like creatures (I think they're called Grievers) can feast on you. Things to look out for in "Runner": 1. There is less focus on the intricacies of the maze and more on the laughable law and order tactics mitigated by the budding young adults. 2. The movie doesn't really have any twists and turns and when it does, it's fully transparent. 3. Characters enter the dystopian world only knowing their name and nothing else about their past. Talk about anesthesia gone afoul.Bottom line: The Maze Runner is well edited by Dan Zimmerman, scripted in a mumbo-jumbo sort of way by three writers, and crisply directed by Wes Ball (he helmed the Short, A Work in Progress). The storytelling is mostly straightforward and "Runner's" running time (ha ha) glides by for most of the way. However, it's not quite compelling when it should be. Why? My money is on the young actors who come off as novices with the sort of heavy-handed PG-13 material. The tone at which these actors are gauging, is rather muted at best (not to mention low key) and as a result, they can't sell scenes that are pivotal to us, the audience. It's not entirely their fault though because there are times when The Maze Runner itself, can't sell us on its foregone conclusion. Case in point: when the lead player (Dylan O'Brien) goes through the maze, comes out of it all shaken up, and lets everyone know that he might have found a way out, we as involved moviegoers aren't quite convinced. I mean, this dude finds an opening where a wall is raised and deadly, menacing creatures come charging out of it. How in the heck is that a way out? You tell me. As for O'Brien himself in the role of Thomas, well he's got movie star looks (he kinda resembles a young Rob Lowe) and a so-so screen presence. But to be honest, he's about as bland as lentil soup. He's definitely not ready to carry a big studio film just yet.Overall, I'm gonna give The Maze Runner a mixed review because although it didn't blow my mind, it still sort of held my interest in a mild, time-killing sort of way. Believe me, this isn't an awful vehicle but it's not something you'd totally "run" to see.Of note: (spoiler alerts) I disliked the way this movie ended immensely. And what threw me for a loop was how it sort of left the window open for a sequel. I mean seriously, what's next? Are these poor kids gonna get dropped into another maze, with enough safe space to build another life, and with possibly a different order and form of governorship? Like I mentioned earlier, I've never read the book (or books) that The Maze Runner is based upon so maybe I'm not getting the gist of what's going on here. Regardless, my questions are as follows: what society allows scientists to manipulate kids like this? Where are their parents? Why are the young guinea pigs all boys with the exception of one girl? I mean, this flick treats the underage like furry rats in a cage. As the credits rolled, I figured that if "Runner" were to make money, there would probably be a new installment in a couple of years or so. In the end I thought to myself, "what's the darn point anyway?"

This film is not the Maze Runner. It has the same title, but it is not the same story. Major plot lines and devices are completely changed/and/or missing completely. Entire sections of the story are taken out of context and mutated to fit into the film's limited run-time.Its a shame because the book (trilogy) is one of the most intense and engrossing experiences I've had in the dystopian genre. I listened to the audiobooks at work over the course of a week-- the hours just flew by and I nearly forgot I was working!I couldn't believe the amount of cheap CGI sellout here. They could have at least kept some of the defining details about the maze, Thomas, and Teresa faithful to the books. But no, it was absolutely pathetic. If you don't care to read the books this is probably a 6.5-7 for you.

Me being someone that has read the series, I had high expectations for this film. I thought this film would be a big let down like the Giver, but I was proved very wrong!The Maze runner starts off intense and will get anyone hooked in the first five minutes. The film has much mystery and suspense; that even I was curious on how it was going to go. The performances by the cast were okay. None stood out, but none were bad.The Action/ running sequences are very intense with the help of the decent soundtrack. The Visuals were pretty good but the one thing that stood out for me in this film was the sound effects. The sounds of the Grievers were terrifying and so well made that I still think of the roars at night.The Ending to this film will surely disappoint those that have not read the book, But I do believe they will explain everything in the sequel (That I hope comes out)The ending will be irrelevant at first, but it is explained in the possible sequel.As a reader, I enjoyed this adaptation greatly. There are new and left out scenes from the book (None that are important. Things are changed, but as a big fan of the book I still enjoyed the changed scenes.) Go see this film. it surely has brought the box office alive, along with pleasing me with a respectful YA Adaptation from the novel. Fans of the book will like it, and want more. People that haven't read it, should be pleased well enough to go see the sequel.

"Not another young adult book adaptation" seems to be the common saying when referring to the numerous movies of this nature recently. Coming into the Maze Runner, I had that thought in the back of my mind but not having read or even heard of the book, I was hoping that it would surprise me, and surprise me it did.The Maze Runner is a very dark film wrapped in mystery and danger. The actual maze looks fantastic and because we are oblivious to what is lurking inside it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Combining high action and suspense with a very solid mystery theme to it, The Maze Runner managed to capture my attention and although it threatens to lose its steam towards the end, the movie never lost me, which is something I wasn't expecting."Lost" "Lord of the Flies" and many monster movies of the past, are elements that The Maze Runner takes on, and delivers in a very memorable experience! Although the ending could have been better, the journey to get to that point, is well worth the time and effort to participate in!

The trailer got me into the cinema and it wasn't even at the halfway point that I realized I'd made a mistake. The premise is interesting. The outline seemed reminiscent of the dark and clever Cube. Unfortunately this film is squarely aimed at the younger, hunger games crowd. Pacing is terrible. There's endless exposition and pointless dialog throughout. The characters are cookie cutter predictable. I feel like we've had variations on this story 1000 times. Instead of using a really interesting premise, the film went exactly where you'd expect. Right down to spelling out the sequel for us in the final act. Uninspired garbage. It's the kind of film Christopher Nolan could turn into a piece of art. It's a pity the writers and director turned this film into derivative mediocrity.

Even though I have not read the supposed book that has been released, I loved the movieI couldn't get enough of it, Everything from the acting to the story line was just perfect, couldn't do it better myself, I find this is one of the best movies I have seen in years, I hate how in the final 20 seconds of the film, It changed my reaction from being so happy from the film to being all annoyed and irritated, It couldn't let the film have its moment, it just had to let us know there will be a sequel, But overall, Once this movie is released I will be buying it as soon as possible, this movie is not something you will get bored of. I do though, Question some parts of the movie, I loved how ever since Thomas got into the maze he was pursued to just uncover all the deep secrets of it, He had to find a way to get out and it just made the movie amazing. Agreeing with another review posted, This is very grippy and kept you surprised until the very end. Something that most films lack of doing,It isn't a typical movie and that just lights it all up

First things first, if you read the book The Maze Runner and liked it go see this movie, end of review for you, but if you haven't read the book keep reading. The Maze Runner is about a boy named Thomas who one day finds himself trapped in the center of wall in a small society surrounded by a maze made up of other boys. None of them remember their past, only their name, and when Thomas shows up he is determined to find a way out of the maze.I was really excited for this movie, the trailer was great, the cast was pretty good, and although I hadn't read the book I heard it was fantastic. I can tell you that the first 45 minutes of this movie are enthralling, suspenseful, and overall really, really impressive. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie isn't all that great. The first half of the movie leaves the audience excited and begging for answers to all the unknowns the brought up, but the problem is the answers aren't satisfying. I won't spoil anything, but the reason the boys are in the maze literally left me in awe at how ridiculous the reason was. And that's not the only answer that left me thinking,"Are you joking me right now?". Now, the reason I said that anyone who read and liked the book should watch the movie is because they already know the answers to the questions in the movie, and they're already satisfied with those answers. Still, anyone who hasn't read the book might be, and in fact probably will be, pretty let down. The only other negative thing I have to say about the movie is the rushed and sloppy ending. The final events occur so quickly that there really isn't any time for the viewer to soak in what's happening. Despite my complaints The Maze Runner isn't a bad movie. Like I said the first half is absolutely amazing. In fact the first half of the movie is so good it might be worth watching just for that alone. And let me add that on top of the impeccable first half every actor does a fantastic job. The action scenes are well shot and suspenseful, and the fantastic score only adds to the excitement. And let me say the CGI maze as well as the grievers look fantastic! The Maze Runner definitely has it's problems, but the good portions of the movie are so good that I might consider it worth going and seeing in theaters. Thanks for reading! I hope this review was helpful!

I saw "The Maze Runner", starring Dylan O'Brien-Teen Wolf_tv, The Internship; Will Poulter-We're the Millers, Son of Rambow; Kaya Scodelario-The Truth About Emanuel, Clash of the Titans_2010 and Patricia Clarkson-Friends With Benefits, Blind Date.This is based on a series of young adults books by James Dashner-so you can look for a franchise. The story kind of reminded me of if you mixed the plots of the Lord of the Flies with the TV show Lost. The movie starts with Dylan as he wakes up in a moving elevator. When it stops, he is in the middle of an open field-which he finds out is called the glades-with a group of other young men standing around him. He has no memories of who he is or how he got there, just like the other boys before him-but after a few days, they do remember their own names-and once a month, a new boy arrives and the first boy that arrived there has been there for 3 years. Encircling the open field is a giant wall that Dylan later discovers is a maze. Every morning, an opening in the wall appears and then closes when the sun goes down. During this time, the boys send runners into the maze to try to find a way out, but if they do not make it out by sunset, they are never seen again. At night, strange noises are heard from the maze which is attributed to these sort of nighttime watchdogs called grievers, which are half robot, half scorpion monsters. Will is one of the earlier memory erased arrivals that does not like Dylan-he is always wanting to punish Dylan and gets disappointed when no one else agrees with him. Kaya is the first girl that arrives in the elevator-after Dylan-and she seems to know Dylan, if not much else. Patricia plays the person behind the curtain that seems to know exactly what is going on and why. The action is pretty good but the story left lots of questions unanswered, but I'm sure they are leaving them for the sequels. It ends like it is setting up the next installment. It's rated "PG-13" for violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray.

As a movie alone, this film is great for individuals who enjoy movies that suck you in and make you think. It has intense moments that leave you wanting more, and make you ask questions. Setting up for a second movie, it leaves you hanging on to the thought that there is more to everything than you first believe. I enjoyed the relationships shown throughout the film, and I thought the actors chosen were perfect for the roles, especially Newt, and Thomas! As an avid reader of all 4 novels, this movie changed a lot of the plot from the book, but still enjoyable. The music heightened every scene and allowed for climactic moments to reach their full potential. I highly recommend this movie to everybody!

They could not have made it any better..Yes, one may argue that they missed out some key parts from the book like Teresa having a telepathic link with Thomas, or that in never rains in the maze.. But that's no big deal! (Anyway, in the movie, Thomas see's Theresa's warning through a dream, and after that warning there's not much to it.)The actors were excellent! Especially Thomas(Dylan O'Brien).The only thing that bugged me is that we didn't see much of Frypan, the cook. He has a slightly-above-average role in the books. The grievers were awesomeThey could've put more emphasis in how Thomas saves Alby by tying him up single handedly. 100/10

I must admit, I wasn't sure what to expect going into this. I watch Teen Wolf, have seen bits of Skins and Game of Thrones, so I was familiar with a few of the actors. Dylan kills it in Teen Wolf, and showed his dramatic/intense acting abilities in season three. A lot of the actors in this movie have shown a lot of promising abilities, so I was hopeful going into it. I purposefully kept myself from reading the book because I love having surprises and tension when I see a movie for the first time. And man, am I glad I did. This movie is so much better when you learn everything alongside Thomas. There is no bullshit romance, which I appreciate. They stayed focused on what was happening, and did it right. There was a great balance of tension. There would be an incredibly intense and stressful scene, but not too much of it and not too little. And the stressful scenes were done right. They didn't shy away from having characters die, showing some violence and a little gore. The entire situation and many scenes were so shockingly dark, which was also oddly refreshing. They focused on the relationships between the characters, the action/mystery, and not to mention that the affects were great. The maze, the grievers, I loved it all. Considering how small the budget was, and how little time they had to shoot it, it all comes together surprisingly well. Usually I dislike the main character. They are too whiny, too needy, too much focus on them, and other characters don't get the attention they deserve. However, I actually liked Thomas a lot. I tried my best to put my love for Dylan O'Brien aside, but I can't help but be so extremely proud and happy for him. He managed to portray this main character in a way that draws the audience him. Thomas takes a little while to get settled in (understandably) but once he does, he is awesome. He portrayed really great leadership qualities; for once, I actually felt that this character deserved the "leadership" and really earned it. There were quite a few heavy scenes, and he pulled them off with conviction and genuine emotions that made my throat swell and my eyes water. Will Poulter also was amazing. Basically everyone was amazing. There are definitely mixed reviews, and I find it such a shame. Seeing as The Hunger Games was released first, every YA adaptation is now immediately compared to it and seen as a "wannabe." But watching Maze Runner, it is definitely it's own film. Of course there are book fans who may be disappointed in changes that were made, but if they had stuck to the book 100%, there would be even more complaints about the "repeated YA clichés". It must have been so hard to try to create a movie, and balance it between it's YA components and also trying to make it different at the same time. I appreciate the work they did, and while there are plenty of clichés in the book, somehow they are pulled off in a very refreshing way. I would suggest that in order to really enjoy this film, don't go into it thinking "Great, another YA adaptation." Just go into it thinking of it as it's own movie, like any other movie you go see at the theaters. Go into it and just enjoy the ride. Above all else, this movie is an amazing adventure/thrilling story. The pacing, the claustrophobia of it all, the acting, the affects, it's all pulled off in a very surprisingly entertaining way. Go watch it, if you are willing, go see it in IMAX! I definitely wish I had seen it in IMAX the first time because it is one of those films that would be worth it. Overall, there are definitely some weaknesses to the movie that critics will be all over, but the strengths definitely override them and make it a movie worth seeing.

If you read the book, prepare for disappointment. Although more complete that the book, the movie is mediocre. It omits the most interesting elements of the Maze Runner, while adding the worst elements from the sequels (The Scorch Trials and The Death Cure).At the heart of the book is solving the puzzle of getting out of the maze, which that has eluded the runners for years. That should be the heart of the movie. Instead, the audience discovers that the maze could never have been solved, and but for the fortuitous discover and use of a device the maze would not be solved and everybody would die. Deus ex machine is a bad plot solution, but "Machine" ex machine would make ancient Greek theatergoers cringe. The movie also discards any attempt to develop relationships between the kids. In the movie, the entire plot is explicitly and inexplicably compressed to three days. This means that any attempt to portray Thomas as being anything but the new outsider fall flat. It's a movie, we don't have to see every day, just let us know that time has passed.] The grievers and the conflict over Ben's sting are nonsensical in the movie. E.g., in the movie nobody has ever survived a night in the maze, the grievers only come out at night when the maze is closed so nobody has ever seen one, the grievers are what sting people (no beetle- blades) but the surprising thing about Ben's sting was that it was "in broad daylight," not that he's dying something had stung him. The screenplay's attempt to give more of an explanation at the end of the movie is understandable, but horribly executed. While the book version ended with little explanation of "why" the kids were in the maze, a movie that left that out would be doomed. However, when one of the biggest criticisms of the sequels is that the author couldn't come up with a decent explanation, then that's the element you should change or explain in the movie! Not these writers, they make the explanation even less believable and more disappointing than the book. At least with the Matrix, the Coppertop explanation was fun to watch (and generated millions in product placement revenue).

'The Maze Runner' marks its run by setting its path ablaze in an explosive heart throbbing start. Right away, it builds its seemingly intriguing and smart storyline with a solid opening sequence, throwing us into immediate action and suspense as the first scene depicts the amnesiac teenager, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), struggling to find his way out of a rattling lift, ascending through a darkness-filled elevator shaft. Emerging to the surface, he finds himself surrounded with multi-ethnic boys who seem not surprised by his arrival. He is immediately welcomed to a commune of teenagers who have been struggling to find their exit from the world they've been mysteriously thrown into--The Glade, a forest dominated settlement surrounded by thick concrete walls whose only gate opens to an intricate and ever-changing maze, one the boys suspect to end up to their only way out of that prison-like expanse.Knowing only his name, curious Thomas joins the league of runners who run into the "griever"-infested maze every morning, to unfold its secrets. His courage is convincing enough to earn him equally-earnest companions to run with him side by side, in his quest to discover the passage out of the Glade. That courage itself, puts growing suspicion to the tough bullying elder, Gally (Will Poulter), whom Thomas immediately finds to be his inevitable and insecure rival. Adding to the tension, is the arrival of the first and only girl in the group, Theresa (Kaya Scodelario), bearing a note that tells she's the last one.There are many obvious elements that keep 'The Maze Runner' within the confines of the Young-Adult Adaptation genre: it happens in a post-apocalyptic era, young teenagers appear to be the last hope of a controlling dystopian society, and at its center is a young protagonist who would go through all lengths to escape his brutal fate. It is interesting to note though some attempts to set itself apart from the craze. Most notably, it doesn't have sexually-intuitive characters as it appears to be more focused on the action and adventures of the hero. The mood is also set in a darker tone, adding more excitement and suspense to its already intriguing premise. However, it's also not easy to shrug off some flaws in the film, flaws that could have been avoided if first time director, Wes Ball, had put equal attention to both the film's visuals and script. While it boasts stunning visuals, the movie's overall output is weighed down by some nonsensical clichés, bland dialogues and tiring one-liners, some not fully developed and utilized characters (ex.Theresa) and misplaced highlights, all these pushing the story out of its track. It feels as if it hasn't maintained, much less taken off, from the level of excitement and suspense it achieved in the first half. Towards the end, it loses grip of its the initial thrill, barely bringing back the intensity with a uninteresting final conflict. In the end it tries to save itself by hinting a promise of an inevitable sequel, one, I can say, it utterly deserves.

I haven't read the book(s?) but after watching this movie I absolutely will. I didn't know what to expect when I sat down at the cinema, waiting for the movie to begin, but it captured me from the very first scene. The mystery surrounding the place where most of the action happens, and the suspense and ominous feeling always hanging in the air made me unable to tear my eyes away from the screen for the entire film. The ending WAS a bit confusing and unsatisfying, but the rest of the movie was absolutely amazing and I will definitely watch it again. This is without a doubt one of the best films I have seen in 2014. Well done!

Frankly, I didn't know what to expect when I decided to go to this movie. I have seen that some of the people I follow for book reviews have read it, and it got mixed reviews. However, sometimes even bad books can be made into good movies or TV shows. Recently The 100 comes into mind, which was like this. It probably also occurred to me, because it has similar themes. Teens trying to survive in a world they don't know much of after an apocalypse.This movie is very action packed. The pacing is good for the most part, however, the ending was a bit abrupt. As if they were shooting, looked at what they had, and realised that they spent too much time on the stuff so far, so they had to finish it already. The story itself isn't typical current YA. Mercifully, no romance! There could be in the future, but not right now. The beginning made me think of Lord of the Flies. While there are moments when it could go that way, it doesn't. Perhaps the makers had enough faith in humanity to think that when a bunch of boys get together, they don't necessarily go for the "kill 'em all" scenario. Even though there are indications that there were more violent days, they could establish peace.There aren't any movies this one specifically reminds me of. That could just be that other than superhero movies, I rarely watch stories with this level of testosterone. Or it could just be that most of it was really vague, and the answers weren't forthcoming. I could liken it to The Hunger Games. However, while it does happen in an enclosed space, there isn't that sense of Big Brother, since the boys don't know where they are, or why. It is obvious that someone is watching, and that some aspects of the environment are controlled, but not to that extent. The people trapped are also victims of some system, but it's not the overarching sense. I even considered that like in another movie that I saw about a futuristic prison that people escape, only to find out that there is no one else out there, and everything was running on automation all along. This idea was actually reinforced by the look of the maze. It had a lot of rust and decay, more than 3 years of the alleged use of the place would indicate in my opinion. So while some details of the story are similar to some other stories I've seen, they only came into my mind afterwards.The characters are a bit clichéd, but it could just be that the action was favoured instead of the character building. The action was really good, had my heart pounding at times, so I didn't mind. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is the main character. It is his appearance that kick starts the changes in the camp. While this could be a flaw in the story, there are indications that this isn't a coincidence, and after a while that can become obvious. There were also some things about the events surrounding him that left me with questions. I hope they will be answered in the next movies. Though if I know myself, I won't stand it that long, and soon enough you will be seeing book reviews of this series, so watch this space. Thomas is the boy who acts, and isn't content to let the bigger, stronger boys lead him. He becomes a leader himself. Thomas' character takes the adventurous character of Stiles to a new level. He is the kind of guy that sees a mountain, and wants to know what's behind it. He also runs towards danger, so he's a kind of hero. I'm not sure if I actually like him, but I often agree with him. Alby (Aml Ameen) is the leader in the camp. He is a good leader, though one of his decisions is strange, because he seems to usually delegate, but then he doesn't. That part felt a bit out of character, but could be better grounded in the book, or not there at all. Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) is Thomas' ally. They have a regular bromance from the start. It may come from Newt's generally relaxed nature, but they have a connection. In this story the actor's British accent felt weird. Everyone sounded American, and then he opened his mouth. I wonder if that was for the character, or an oversight, or he just had a hard time getting rid of it and they left it like that. In spite of this, I soon forgot about his accent, as he formed a really likable character. Gally (Will Poulter) is the evil guy. He is a bit of a cliché from the very start. The bully. The guy who never agrees with Thomas. The guy you just know will end up doing something horrible. He is also the opposite of Thomas in that if he sees a mountain, he just sees the peaks, and then looks around and feels content with what he has. In a way, like a lot of bullies, he's scared of change, of anything different from what he knows. I almost felt sorry for him.The ending was kind of a surprise. Though frankly, I didn't know what to expect. In fact, the end brought up more questions than answers. Why I'm sure the series will be on many new reading lists, and sales will increase. People generally aren't that good at waiting for answers.Overall, an exciting movie, and a baffling one. I kind of hoped to decide just how much I liked it in the course of writing this review. I'm still not sure, thus the 3 stars. I do recommend it though, if not for anything but the exciting action, and the interesting mystery. Don't expect to leave the theatre fully satisfied though. Frustrated would be more like it.

To be honest, I went to the theater without any high expectations. Dare to say I was not in a good mood either. But the film did not let me down alas, which was a good thing.First of all, I really like the approach of "The Maze Runner". It was direct, intriguing and straight up to the point. However I did find it a bit confused at first when everything was displayed in front of my eyes without much explanation about the context behind it all. All truth to be told, the I-have-a-set-of-rules-which-you- probably-gonna-break-anyway thing was getting a bit too tiresome and unconvincing, since we were not left with the impression that those rules were made to last. But the film did manage to pull out some pretty touching moments as well as some small twists, which in my opinion were quite appreciating. Overall I did enjoy the plot, though I still could point out dozens of holes in it.Next, talking about the cast. I really did not enjoy the 2 main actors and actresses. They acted very forced as if they already knew what was going to happen next. But the supporting casts did quite a plausible job. Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt played a believable character whom seemed to be smart and encouraging. And the young Blake Cooper really gave quite an impression though the playtime of his was not so long. Last but not least, Kee Hong Lee as Minho also did his part very well in term of being a leader of the Runner team. Since the film does not possess a real villain aside from Mr. Nice Guy Will Poulter, I can safely assume that this guy could not, I repeat, COULD NOT play a bad guy. Even being a confusing one at that. To come to a conclusion, let's just say that this film is good enough for me to start picking up the books and see what happens next to the characters.

After watching the maze runner, I was seriously surprised by how amazing it was. There were a few parts that I was worried about but then I was mind blown. I was also worried about the major parts of the book that were not going to be incorporated but then again I was surprised. As a teenage who's read all the books I can seriously say that this is probably the best directed dystopia book in comparison to the hunger games.I really recommend this movie, it's auctioned pack and suspenseful. If you want something entertaining to watch, the maze runner should be something you really consider. Dylan O'Brien did an amazing job portraying "Thomas." Thomas is a very intricate character in the book, the author James Dashner wrote the book so you can really understand Thomas and his thoughts, you get to know and understand Thomas in a different way, although the movie does not have Thomas narrate I still believe it was Amazing.

This weekend is a big weekend, with at least three blockbuster movies releasing in my neck of the woods. I start my reviews this weekend with perhaps the most anticipated of the bunch, the Maze Runner. Once again Hollywood has decided to take a book series and run with it, in hopes that it will be the next big series to change the world. Yet like always, the question remains: Is this another glorified mess from the trailers, or have they done a good job? Well with two of my good buddies, I headed to the theater to start my weekend of reviews. I've never read the books, but knowing general trends Maze Runner has some big shoes to live up to. The premise is quite simple, a boy gets sent up to a center of the maze with a handful of other boys, and no memories of where he was before. This familiar bout of amnesia, is apparently normal, and within seconds he is integrated into a culture reminiscent of Lord Of The Flies. Of course, like always, Thomas is the one who defies the normal rules, and starts the journey of change that starts the trilogy. While the story is nothing we haven't seen before, the Maze Runner has some suspense and unknown elements that keeps you latched into the film. Throughout the film, my mind worked to uncover and guess the twists they had at the end, knowing the general nature of the set-up, yet not quite able to figure out the specific details. It is this element, at least for a Maze Runner newbie like me, that kept me into the movie. Despite the underlying mystery though, there were some other elements in the mix that made the Maze Runner an interesting experience. For one thing the movie is well shot and edited together. The entire journey is captured well, each angle well suited to give you the greatest detail in as little transitions. The same techniques remain during the dramatic argument scenes, which, when combined with the audio of booming drums and blaring horns, brings out the emotion and tension the boys are feeling. Yet, the best part of the camera editing are the action scenes, especially concerning the maze. It is always nice to see a movie defy the trend of shaky camera work, forgoing the "realistic" first person perspective for actually showing us the scene at hand. Whether it be running or fighting, the camera is surprisingly stable and well focused on the matter at hand and brings some excitement to a rather slow plot line. Yes, unfortunately the story of the Maze Runner is a little drawn out and at points, rather vague and inconclusive. At first the ambiguity is fun, the multiple, unanswered questions keeping you wondering what path the movie will turn down next. These elements are integrated quite well with character developing moments, allowing more character buildup to help set the stage. However, for this reviewer it's nice to get some answers at points in the movie instead of more questions. Maze Runner for me provided vague solutions to the unknown, leaving more questions with that answer. Now this can be good if there is a nice wrap up to the madness, but for this movie that wasn't the case for me. I know, many are going to say that there are three books and answers come later, but this reviewer wanted a little more wrap up to at least some of the questions that developed over the two hours. To tell you the truth, I felt kind of gipped at the end of the movie, saying at the end, and I quote one of the characters, "Really?"Despite the ambiguity though there are two other elements that help keep the movie going. First off the action is fun and relevant to the plot, the maze portions in particular being an intense fight for survival. Despite being a little savage and gruesome at parts, the evolutionary drive to remain alive is balanced with strategy, running, and fights with primitive tools. The action doesn't seem extra, but is built into the story quite well, spanning the fighting spectrum between the male rivalry to fighting the raging the Grievers. Of course the action is only as good as the acting as well, especially when it comes to interacting with CGI settings. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is the staple to the casting, surprising me with his performance of a male version of Catniss. Unlike the leading lady though, Thomas fought the culprits without being as whiney, a plus in my book for a leading character. O'Brien had a nice balance to his role, passionate and fiery, without crossing into an overacted, melodramatic mess. Lead Maze Runner Minho (Ki Hong Lee) was also a nice supporting character, bringing the wing man role to life and adding a little grounding to Thomas's flamboyant attitude. As for characters like Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Alby (Aml Ameen), Chuck (Blake Cooper), and Gally (Will Poulter), they were good too and each did a nice job playing their respective characters. Though with the exception of O'Brien, the real strength was the chemistry between all the group was the greatest quality of the acting and the community they formed. Overall the Maze Runner is a decent addition to the movie based on book library. There is a nice design to the movie, and a lot of good character building to set the stage in this morbid tale. Acting wise it is enjoyable, but in reality it's the action surrounding the story that got me the most. I still wished though that there was some better wrap up than what we got, despite the opening it provided. Overall a decent movie to watch this weekend, and has elements worth a visit to the theater. My scores are:Action/Mystery/Sci-Fi: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0

When I first learned that The Maze Runner series could potentially turn into the big screen, I immediately bought all four books (The Maze Runner, The Scorched Trials, The Death Cure and lastly, The Kill Order; this being the prequel) a month before the movie was out. There was a lot of mixed reviews regarding the books, but I still decided to grab them and fell in love, having read all three in a month on my kindle. Still working on The Kill Order. The prequel book felt different and slow in my opinion...This was obviously one of many proud moments in my life to finally have had the chance to not only READ, but WATCH the movie. Being able to compare the two was very cool. I swear I was nodding and smiling throughout the movie. However, I was a bit disappointed with the movie. ****WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW. DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. SPOILERS BELOW.************************First and foremost, the movie was roughly 1 hour 40 mins, not including the credits. There was a lot of character development in the books, but the movie didn't cover that part which isn't my main complaint. THE MOVIE FELT VERY SHORT AND RUSHED. The director skipped out on so many major points that could've made the movie a lot better or at least give the audience (those who didn't read the books) a better grasp of the environment Thomas & Co. was forced upon. In the book, it seemed to take forever to find the way out of the maze. In the movie it was just BOOM. BOOM. OHH, There's THE EXIT. THE END.Just a few key points in comparison. BOOK: 1. Newt was the first to welcome Thomas after he arrives. 2. Thomas shortly discovers a mechanical insect that has W.I.C.K.E.D written on its body, multiple times in different occasions (important) 3. Thomas was given a proper tour of the Glades, all four corners had a special meaning (farm, slaughterhouse, homestead, graveyard). 4. Chuck and Thomas shared more bromance in the book. 5. Alby sacrifices himself towards the end. 6. Teresa and Thomas can communicate telepathically. 7. Thomas & Co. doesn't know about Ava Paige (director of W.I.C.K.E.D). 8. Thomas finds the exit which is a hidden portal at the edge of the maze. They would have to jump off the edge into the portal. 9. Gally runs off to the maze towards the end (important). 10. Gally kills Chuck with a knife which was meant for Thomas. Thomas reacts by punching Gally to the point where it is considered smashing instead.(important). 11. The group escapes through a bus. Saved by civilians that were against W.I.C.K.E.D 12. They enter a building (barracks) and finds food and bed and they all sleep, thinking everything is over. 13. Thomas first learns the meaning behind W.I.C.K.E.D while exploring/running in the maze. 14. The maze drawings was the key in part of finding the way out of the maze. 15. The Map Room was burned down. 16. People slept on the grass. There were HUNDREDS of people. 17. Alby was being "controlled" (important) by an unknown entity while he was being treated for getting stung by a griever.MOVIE: 1. Gally is the first to meet Thomas in the elevator. 2. Thomas and Teresa didn't communicate telepathically. 3. There were probably half the amount of people compared to the books. 4. They find a "key" inside a dead Griever. 5. Said key opens the door to the exit. 6. Alby is killed by a Griever. 7. Alby wasn't being "controlled". 8. Gally kills Chuck with a gun and Gally gets speared by Minho. 9. Thomas & Co didn't meet the "founders in white" inside pods, per se. 10. Thomas & Co escapes via helicopter. 11. Movie ends while the helicopter is entering THE SCORCHED TRIALS. OH YEAHHHHHHHHHH!!!! SEQUEL PLEASE. MORE THAN 2 HOURS PLEASE. 12. Ava Paige fakes her death, but explains why W.I.C.K.E.D is "good" before her fake death via recorded video. 13. I counted 9 survivors (Thomas, Teresa, Minho, Newt, Frypan, Winston? and the rest).The ending was a big twist compared to the books which I don't mind at all. Again, my main complaint was that the first movie of a potential trilogy felt very short and the director/writers skipped out on a lot of events that could've made the movie better or at least added more time to fit the 2 hour slot, just like any other trilogy-based book-to-movie adaptation. At the end of Maze Runner, there were still quite a number of kids left. Curious to see how the sequel will play out with this small group. 6/10

Grim visions live on in James Dashner's The Maze Runner, the latest young adult novel to receive on-screen treatment. If 20th Century Fox have their way, we can expect at least two more entries, especially since a sequel is already in pre-production. The pitch is that a group of boys are stuck on a small slab of land (the Glade) surrounded by a large maze that, at night, closes and plays host to creatures known as Grievers. Enter Thomas, our protagonist and the latest in a monthly addition to said group. Unlike his more settled companions, Thomas immediately repels the idea of confinement and urges his newfound neighbors to take initiative in discovering a way out. One can't help approaching The Maze Runner with an air of trepidation, given the number of similarly styled movies we've seen a sudden influx of. There are only so many times younglings can be subjected before we feel we've had our fill. The film does have its competencies, but the chances of captivation and anticipation for the apparently-confirmed sequel are simply far-fetched. The Maze Runner's greatest facet is its overall intrigue--the mystery it initially presents for us to pick at. While the use of momentary flashbacks is disenchanting, viewers can expect a light mental stretch from their first viewing. Another commendable aspect is how the themes are implemented. They aren't subtle, but we're at least spared the disservice of being drilled by overwrought messages and symbolism. Perhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise, however, is the consistency of acting. O'Brien does an adequate job as the curious protagonist with a drive to do something, yet Will Poulter stands tallest as Gally, the stubborn voice of suspicion. In that, the chemistry is also worth touching on, but you're not going to experience the same level of connection as Harry Potter or even The Hunger Games. This is where the unlikelihood of The Maze Runner's overall resonance stems from. Most of what's presented works for the sake of adequacy, but finding anything of superb quality is almost as frivolous as making sense of the ending. For most of the runtime, The Maze Runner moves at a steady, methodical pace. Then those last five minutes pull the rug out and leave the film to slip and crumble oh so comically. About the only reason to feel indifferent to this coy play is the probable lack of total investment, which is to say (and confirm) that if you remain detached throughout the whole affair, then you may be better off than those who are more impressionable.www.theretailjudge.com

This movie is fantastic. I loved it at first I didn't think I would like it but I liked it by the beginning it's a eye catcher. Anyone of all ages would like this movie. It's a year jerker sometimes. But you will fall in love with it. :) I promise. The main character just wakes up one day in what they call a box and he soon finds out there is no way to escape. So he and the gladers must join together and help find a way out. The story line in this movie is great. The details and affects were also great. I loved everything about this movie Evan eyyyebraws aka galley. These kids are all just scared and worried that they will never find a way out. But you will have to tune in to see the movie for your self and see what happenes.

The Maze Runner is an exceptionally entertaining little movie that belies its origins as a young-adult story. It's one of those increasingly rare movies that make excellent use of such quaint amenities as setting and atmosphere to instill a real sense of panic, courage, determination, and fear in even the most disaffected teenager. It's tightly paced, with few logical inconsistencies to nitpick, too.It all begins when Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) wakes up to find himself in a rapidly ascending elevator stocked with what appear to be provisions of some kind. When the elevator stops and the top is opened, he discovers that he's the latest arrival in an all-boys community that's at the center of a giant, ever-changing, complex stone maze. The boys, some of whom have been there for a long time, have established a pacifistic community that relies on those monthly provisions and their own hard work (building shelters, low-level farming) to survive.But that maze. It's enormous and inscrutable. There are specialists, called Runners, who enter the maze each morning in order to map it and to try to find a way out. But if they don't return by dusk, the maze's stone doors will close, leaving the hapless teens inside for the night. And no one has ever spent a night in the maze and survived.This is the ominous, bleak scenario with which young Thomas is presented. Alby (Aml Ameen), the leader of the crew, explains that there are only three rules in The Glade, that happy little faux-Paradise in which they all live: do your part, don't hurt another Glade resident, and don't feed them after midnight. Wait, sorry, that last one is from Gremlins. I meant that Gladers (uh huh) are forbidden to go into the maze. Well, unless they happen to be Runners.So, once a month they get new supplies and a new young dude. But once Thomas arrives, things start to be a little different in the Glade. A runner is stung by a Griever (they're nasty robotic creatures who lurk in the maze) in broad daylight. Stings aren't good - they incapacitate the stung person and imbue them with violent tendencies. As such, he who has been stung is necessarily banished from The Glade, for the safety of the rest of the clan.Thomas isn't like everyone else, as the somewhat-hotheaded Gally (Will Poulter, Chronicles of Narnia: The Dawn Treader) is quick to point out. Gally notices that things seem a little off since Thomas's arrival, and he blames the greenie for disrupting what felt like a little slice of heaven. But on Thomas's side are Alby, Alby's second in command Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and the most-recent new blood, a young boy named Chuck (Blake Cooper), who looks a lot like Chunk from The Goonies.Something has changed with Thomas's arrival; it seems that whoever or whatever is behind the maze's creation is changing the rules. For one thing, an unscheduled arrival of the elevator yields a new member for the group: a girl. The first one, in fact. It's Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), who appears to know Thomas from before their time in The Glade. Both Thomas and Theresa have dreams regarding their "before time" - again, unlike the others.Thomas is acutely aware that the existence of the group in The Glade is not necessarily permanent, as evidenced by the attacking Grievers and the various infighting of the Gladers. Thomas wishes to find out more, and Gally simply doesn't, content to keep things as they are. This is the crux of the movie's moral issue - is it better to keep what one has, even if one has little and under repressive conditions, or to strive to escape those conditions on the hope of finding a better life elsewhere? Leaving aside the morality of having teenagers battle robot-animal hybrids (goodness knows we've seen plenty of movies about kids killing enemies or each other lately), the eternal question of why the boys and Teresa are even in The Glade lingers over them all. It's just that Gally and his small band of followers don't want to know the answer, and Thomas and his desperately do.The action is fierce and creative. Even the battles with various Grievers are well shot (sometimes tough to do with robots, because with so much activity it can be difficult to discern what's what and who's who, particularly in a low-light setting), and the maze is something to behold - a real work of art, were it real. The acting is better than might be expected for a young-adult film, and O'Brien, Brodie-Sangster, and Poulter are each well cast.It's obvious that The Maze Runner is intended to be a franchise - if it enjoys box-office success, of course. If this turns out to be another Golden Compass, then this may be the only Maze Runner movie we see. Which is a shame, because there are plenty of dangling plot lines at the end. Even so, the movie is exciting and persuasive and doesn't try to dumb itself down for the sake of its audience.

Alright, this movie was great. Unless you have read the book.I was a GIGANTIC fan of the book. I became very invested when I found out there was going to be a movie because I thought it would be amazing. Wrong. If you have read the book, you know one of the main parts is how Teresa and Thomas can chat with their minds and how it plays out even further into the rest of the books, right? THEY Don't HAVE THIS IN THE MOVIE. I was very disappointed. I was honestly heart broken. I usually look past this kind of stuff but I just couldn't this time. Dylan O'Brien is a great actor. But he looks WAY too old for this movie. He is suppose to be like 16 and he looks 25. They should have has someone else play the lead role.

This movie when not compared to James Dashners book is wonderful. The cinematography is wonderful, the script is great, and the acting is even better. I admit I might be biased on the acting part my favorite actor stars in this movie. Here are the reasons its not good.Alby shows Thomas around the first day. The screen writer gave Alby all of Chucks dialog from the book. Theresa doesn't go into a coma. Ben isn't in "the changing" when Thomas comes to the Glade. there is no cliff. the "keeper's meeting" isn't private. Gally doesn't get mad at the meeting and leave the Glade. In the maze Thomas has Minho's help getting Alby up on the maze wall. it rains. Theresa brings the serum with her. Thomas and Theresa don't communicate telepathically. The Griever attack is all wrong. Gally doesn't give himself to the grievers. there are numbers as a password. the scientists are dead when the "Gladers" arrive. Gally doesn't want to leave. Gally kills chuck without being controlled. the maze is not underground. For those reasons I give this a rating of seven. it follows the book but leaves out things that are important. Not all of the things I put are important to the movie. but I felt were.

I'm already tired of these poorly raised futuristic dystopias, which don't show any interest in genuine science fiction, and only work as the basis of trite teenage fantasies where the main characters always discover they are "the chosen one", or that they are "special" in some way. The Maze Runner is another one of those films, even though its good manufacture and competent performances make it worthy of a slight recommendation. Based on a series of novels written by James Mashner, The Maze Runner is kinda like Lord of the Flies with monsters, and with the obligatory sinister conspiracy as the background of its elementary narrative. There aren't many surprises or creativity; just the same formula as always, but executed with enough gravity and melodrama to keep the audience slightly interested (as "audience", I'm talking about embittered old men like me; but I don't pretend to guess the effect or acceptation this movie can have with the teenage audience it was obviously made for). As I previously said, the actors make a good work, bringing credibility to their clichéd characters of hero, villain, mentor, ally, etc. (Is there someone who didn't guess during the first 10 minutes who was eventually going to die in order to prove that "things are for serious"?). Despite its abundant logical holes, The Maze Runner develops a more or less interesting mystery, but when we finally reach to the explanations, they are absurd and excessively forced. In conclusion, I wasn't left very satisfied by The Maze Runner because of its lack of ingenuity, clichés and weak conclusion, but it managed to keep me moderately entertained because of its performances and Wes Ball's adequate direction. Besides, I have to say I found The Maze Runner superior to Divergent, Beautiful Creatures and The Hunger Games; I know that that isn't something very enthusiastic to say, but we can't demand too much from this kind of films.

"The Maze Runner" is the latest in a slew of Young Adult Novel Series to come to the big screen – Following "Twilight", "Mortal Instruments", "The Hunger Games" and "Divergent". Outside of "Mortal Instruments", all of them have been hugely successful at the Box Office, with "The Hunger Games" getting the most critical praise, and deservedly so in my opinion. Like "The Hunger Games" and "Divergent", "The Maze Runner" seems to take part in a Dystopian future. I read the first book, on which "The Maze Runner" movie is based, after I saw the first trailer. While not into the book as much as "The Hunger Games" Books and the first "Divergent" Book (Haven't read the others yet), I still liked it. The movie adaption mirrors my feelings for the most part on the book. The movie was not great, but it was alright, and at the end – You want to know what happens next. The movie opens with a teenage boy, played by Dylan O'Brien, ascending upward in a freight elevator. The elevator opens to a bunch of teenage boys. O'Brien's character does not remember his name, nor his past. He is told all of the boys went through this, and he will remember his name in a day or two – and this comes to pass, eventually remembering his name is Thomas. The boys are all living in a community, with a grassy square, they have named "The Glade", surrounded on all sides by giant concrete walls, one of which opens to a Maze. The oldest boy dates back 3 years being there, with a new boy a coming up in the elevator every month, along with supplies. Some of the boys, named "The Runners" explore the Maze during the day, in hopes of finding a way out, but must return to "The Glade" at night, before the doors close, and creatures they call "The Grievers", who they haven't seen, but heard, come out in the Maze. Anyone who has not made it back before the doors closed has been killed by "The Grievers". For those who read the book, there are some changes, but the narrative is generally followed. The young actors all do pretty well. As I said the movie was alright. Sometimes I though additional parts were needed or parts needed to be elongated to make it a great film. But in terms of setting the table for the series (I admit presumably – I will be starting the 2nd book soon), and in wanting to know what happens next – Mission Accomplished. 3 out of 4 Stars.

This movie was amazing. Period. Though it did have a few faults. Things I liked: 1. They didn't hold back on the intensity and suspense. Most books that are made into movies are more mild than the book. Though there are a some intense parts they left out or are milder, it turned out OK. This is an opinion remember.2. It had me on the edge of my seat. Literally, I was on the edge of the movie theater seat because of the suspense. It was amazing.3. Acting. The acting was very well done, Dylan O'Brien did an amazing job playing the "Confused yet brave and determined Thomas".Things I didn't like, these things are not a huge deal or anything. The film was amazing. 1. The extremely fast plot. Things excelled pretty quickly. One minute Thomas is arriving the 'The Box' and the next he is running through the maze, which no one except the 'Maze Runners' have done.2. The open and confusing ending. At the end it is showed that they escaped from the maze and are helped by a mysterious group of people. The people that put them in the maze are all shown dead and a video shows a women shooting herself. They are shown flying away in a helicopter. The next scene though shows all the people who where shown dead, discussing how there plan worked and the kids are the future.The biggest con for me was the extremely open ending, because now I'm going to have to read the books to get an idea of what is going to happen...

While I was happy to finally see a male-oriented film series – and yeah, even before the last half hour of "To Be Continued!" scenes – in a female dominated marketplace (the Twilight "saga," The Hunger Games and Divergent) this movie all-but completely blew.Aside from The Maze Runner being a blatant rip-off of the superior Cube film, or its sequels, it was so incredibly bland, run-of-the- mill, predictable and A-B-C, I actually fell asleep during the movie. It didn't help that the movie was twenty minutes too long and that I knew what scene would take place four scenes ahead.During the movie I was absolutely giving it the benefit of the doubt. Without so much as telling us this was "Part One" of a trilogy (or four movies, depending on how well the first one does and they inevitably split the last movie into two so they can milk the series our longer than it needs, i.e. The Hunger Games, Harry Potter and Twilight,) the movie seemed to take its long time to explain everything out in extreme detail of their world. I was trying to be as patient as possible when I knew this was a necessity since this is a sci-fi, futuristic test for young boys.But, the rest of the movie played out this way. As if in narration form. They constantly had to tell us and remind us of the world they're referring to in the very movie they're showing us. I get it. I got it. And unfortunately, they we're showing me anything new.So, I waited and waited for something fresh. Some new take. Nope. And worse, as mentioned above, the last half-hour was NOTHING but setting up the inevitable sequels. I am getting ahead of myself since I haven't mentioned the synopsis. Very basically, once a month, a new young male recruit is transported into the middle of an obscenely large maze. He has memory loss and must have the entire plot be explained to him so he can integrate with the other males. They've been there between 3 years and present day and must make it through a hefty and unexplainably moving maze to get back to where they don't remember they've come from.Naturally, our "hero," Thomas, is THE ONE to help them get free. With little explanation and in one of the most pointless plots of recent movies, he joins forces with one of the most uncharismatic of all females – the first girl to join the group. Hilariously enough, she looks incredibly similar to Kristen Stewart of her Twilight series. Just like Bella, Stewart's bland heroine from Twilight, this one offers nothing to the table and is so hard to root for. In fact, it appears this endless rock-throwing female was only introduced to attract more female viewers.And that is a huge part of the problems here. While, again, I am glad to finally see a male-dominated teeny-bop series, not one single character had the charisma of any of the other series. Yeah, I'm not a huge Harry Potter or Hunger Games fan, but each of those had characters I rooted for and wanted to see succeed. This Maze Runner had one, and he was absolutely a second or third tier fella: Chuck. But, then again, if you've seen The Sandlot, he was the same guy who called that main character "Smalls."With virtually no one to root for, a story as old as time, decent special effects but barely used and predictable scenes from beginning to no-conclusion, this movie is highly UN-recommended. Granted, it's not the worst movie I've seen in a long while and definitely not the worst of 2014 so far, it will be so forgettable, they will be regretting they only made this movie to be part of a trilogy that should never be completed.* * *Final thoughts: If you're thinking of beginning this so-so franchise, either do one of two things: Wait for this to all come to home- viewing and have a boring, nothing weekend to get through them all or just rent/buy/stream the superior Cube series. Essentially, they're the same movie, but Cube had a tenth of the budget with ten times the heart, originality, imagination, suspense and characters than The Maze Runner had at any given moment.

Contains spoilers. Forewarned that not having read the book would mean some parts wouldn't make sense I watched the movie. I am OK with the beginning as it is like joining a movie half way through. But then we have the high wall keeping out the monsters (King Kong); the lads splitting into two groups (Lord of the FLy's); The supervisors mixing up the scenery (Hunger Games) The escape from erehwon ( Logans Run), The studio (Terminator) etc We are expected to believe an elaborate test includes a maze that would be way beyond budget for any selection process. Some lads escape only to find the one who wants to stay behind is there already. Finally its all in the desert but seems to have a temperate climate. It leaves us as it finds us wondering what is happening, but thats OK I like serials... The script is so predictable and tedious I actually liked having bits that didn't make sense, at least it broke up the tedium. Its for kids not adults.

While I do wish this had more to do with the maze than it ultimately ended up being about, and while I wish it had more Patricia Clarkson, those are extremely little nits to pick in an otherwise smooth adaptation of the James Dashner novel.One of the reasons this is such a compelling watch, is a combination of pitch-perfect casting and superior-though-short-of-being-award-worthy performances. The young cast, of whom the only known face (other than Clarkson) to me was Thomas Brodie-Sangster ('Jojen' from 'Game of Thrones'), and another kid (Will Poulter) that plays a (kinda) antagonist within the setting so to speak, who most of us would remember from 'Son of Rambow', 'Narnia 3' and 'We're the Millers' (his physical comedy in that one did evoke peals of laughter in the audience, in spite of most of it being of the juvenile variety, and that's not easy to pull off, regardless of it appearing commonplace). The lead should be known to the TV- watching American audience, since he's more famous for 'Teen Wolf', and suits the role to a T.Much has also been written about the production design that gives the surroundings a suitable, lived-in feel, and that works in building and maintaining the atmosphere of the setting. However, I, for one, felt that this world was not as explored as it could've been, with quite a few holes in the narrative being unexplored/unexplained. However, that would be a quirk of the written word vs the screenplay, since the novel did have its plot set in stone, and Wes Ball and the crew quite possibly decided to stick to it rather than experiment like the way 'Game of Thrones' has been doing, albeit with the support of its prolific (ha, ha) author. Suffice to say that while I did notice that the narrative did not take as many chances with the material as it could have, I was saved from having that feeling while watching the cinematic events unfold, since the editing et al keeps things moving at a fairly decent pace that these become nits to pick only while writing the review, not otherwise. And that IS a compliment, albeit a little backhanded one.They also gave away more of the back-story than I expected they would, and the taste it leaves is one of intrigue and just enough curiosity for us to check out the subsequent movies in this trilogy.Wish I'd had the opportunity to watch this in the format it's been converted to - Barco Escape, but that's an experiment being carried out only in the US for now, and that too across 5 cinemas only, overall. Hopefully, sometime soon. All in all, a good watch at the cinema this weekend.

Maze runner is for me awesome movie because it has tension it has action and it has drama and it is also very interesting and original idea.The first maze scene was absolutely breath taking.Young Dylan O'Brien was fantastic for me.The graver's we're awesome too they were kind of scary,they were robotic.The running scenes we're great.The maze looked epic.Then the last scene from the chopper looked amazing too.The infection at the end of the movie in the TV looked totally creepy and scary,it looked like some kind of zombie.One of the things that bother me was that at the end the only thing you find out is that it was only one of the trials.I hope that it makes enough money so they can make second(third)movie.

I have seen the trailer of the movie and got hooked up really bad. Distopian novels and movies have found their place among my favorites recently. While waiting for the movie I decided to read the book first. Loved it. All three parts of it. So when the movie came out, me and my husband went to the premiere. Of course, I realize that the script does not always follow the book, some simplifications and omissions are a normal practice. But with the Maze Runner, I was utterly disappointed :( The main drawback of the film (as compared to the book) - is the explanation behind the Maze is not something you are gradually led to, but rather it is something sprung on you at the end of the film, in a "because I said so" kind of way. You may understand that, but you don't empathize with it. In the book, from the very beginning you get those little hints that all of this has to do with the way people think, react to various factors, that this is something to do with the brain, that somebody is watching the Gladers all the time and in introducing new factors and risks and sees how they would react; that there is a higher meaning to that. The telepathy thing between Thomas and Theresa (excluded from the movie) strengthens the idea. The dreams of Thomas (which are very detailed and present a little peak into the subconscious and the memories Thomas lost starting from the childhood - mostly excluded) support the feeling that something bad had happened to the humankind. In the movie - you don't have it. There is a glade, the gladers want to get out because... well because for some reason the gate wouldn't close... Thomas is behind that, but what and why he was doing - he doesn't say... It is a bit chaotic. My husband didn't get that either - he still doesn't understand why I took him to the movie. Maybe I am too prejudiced because I have read the book, but this is the first time I am that disappointed - The Hunger Games, The Divergent (among many others) haven't left me feeling that way. There, I loved the script, I understood why some parts have been omitted and that some things could not be shown. The Maze Runner could have done much better IMHO. So, my advice would be to just read the book and imagine it.

Maze Runner borrows all its beats from other films. There's nothing original here. This is an obvious ploy to take us for a ride and this recycled crap is what is wrong with Hollywood.This movie is weak in all areas that make a movie classic, but strong in all areas that churn box office tickets; this is all visual.We were rooting for these characters to die, and hoping for each turn that this would turn into an amazing slasher flick like Cabin in the Woods... but we were disappointed.Harry Potter meets Hunger Games meets The Lord of the Rings meets every other film made with teenagers. They had a Piggy character from the Lord of the Flies novel, but he wasn't picked on. The main character is a cardboard version of Taylor Lautner's Jacob, and the female lead isn't really even in the movie. She does absolutely nothing except give one of the boys a chance to say, "girls are weird". I realized after the movie that the girl in this movie is Kaya Scodelario or Effy from Skins. Kaya can act -- she is insanely good -- and they barely gave her any lines or anything to work with. We don't know who this character is at all by the end. She might as well stayed in the basement.Three years these young men are stuck together. There is no homosexuality, no masturbation or jokes about masturbation (come on man these are teens -- there would be SOMETHING), no attacks on the first girl to show up in a few years. Nobody even hits on her. Nothing at all. We are simply expected to throw human nature out the window.The set for this shitty film is a Hollywood Sandbox surrounded by a death trap. Snoooooze. The death trap is not particularly interesting. The big baddies that patrol the deathtrap never once decide to scale the walls... because they are machines programmed to serve a purpose. What purpose? We do not know because Hollywood prefers not to reveal that. They haven't decided yet. There is no background, no huge reveal as to why these teens are in the situation they were in, and we are left in the dark at the end of the film.But that's not even the biggest issue here. Nobody who made this film really thought very hard about the serious flaws. None of the boys scale the walls to map the maze from the middle? From up there you can see the whole maze.This is just unintelligent mediocrity with some pacing and action but it's not even that good unless you try to watch it as a comedy, which is what we did.You leave wondering what this was even about. Then you realize it was about making money for Hollywood via shitty CGI.

The movie is watchable and perhaps entertaining, but my wife did not like it at all. We both like thrillers, but this one was questionable at best as such.Problems: A large group of teenage boys, on their own with no adult direction or counseling, and they all seem to get along well? Ha! I was in an orphanage where we were over 20 boys about the same age as in the movie, and I can tell you that the movie's portrayal is not realistic. These boys are at the prime age when sex is practically the most important thing in their lives, there are no girls around, and everything is OK? Finally, when a girl shows up, none of the boys has any desire for her? Ha!And in spite of all this, some of the boys in the beginning appear to be fine with the notion of not trying to escape?The filming of the boys fighting with the monster is poorly done and the audience cannot tell what is happening. All the scenes are very up close, short duration, and definitely nothing but confusing. Contradictions (maybe mild spoilers?) The boys have managed to create a detailed model of the maze. Yet, at the beginning of the movie we are told that the maze changes daily, and based on the changes we see happen, there is no way that a model could be made. If the designated boys would be capable of 'mapping' a portion of the maze each day, by the time they mapped another portion the following day, the previous day's rendition would likely already be obsolete.The monster evidently is man-made, and its legs, stingers, and so on appear to be made of steel. Yet, the boys can hurt and even defeat the monsters with crude wooden spears.

Seen the "maze runner" yesterday, please don't listen to the critics, which I keep getting the strong feeling that they are getting paid by some the disturbers. It's a pretty bad movie, you will watch it feeling that the screenwriters just did copy paste from every somewhat successful movie that has been done lately, he even thrown in at the last second a Kristen Stewart look a like complete with the half dumb look in her eyes, since the movie is pretty much all made from well kept only boy teens do seems a bit over the top very gay, in any case most of the acting was OK even though you are wondering did the deserted characters had a beauty salon close by that fixed their hair every two hours? the script was lame and movie time way too long, so save your self a good two hours of your life and go do something else , something fun, maybe running?

Finally a proper teen novel movie that is of a good theme and a more believable story(although sci-fi).It has no boring romance like Twilight or a weak plot like Hunger Games(although I am a fan).The story is about a group/community of teenage boys captured by someone and erased or their memory except of their name ,common sense and linguistic skills. They don't know what this movie is about and neither do we. We finally find out in the climax and it is satisfying. Although it is not what I predicted , it was(for the first time) awesome.Dylan O Brein's acting is terrific and so is the others. There is nothing wrong with the movie. Only problem I could find was they lacked the ability to now that it would be a hit and should have begun the sequel immediately as we feel starved and incomplete without the sequel coming soon. I believe it has great potential and is at war with The Hunger Games.

The future of the teen to twenties continues to have a consistent tone in science fiction and fantasy. Either grow up and be responsible or die! I know that is a bit harsh but The Maze Runner and others like the Hunger Games paints a bleak picture in general in which the adults in charge build a world in which the only objective for its youth is survival. The star of this thrill 'run', Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) has been on my radar for the past few years as I must admit Teen Wolf is one of my television viewing guilty pleasures. The past few seasons he has emerged as an amazing talent and really showcased his emotional range when possessed by the Nogitsune in season 3. He is quite convincing in this role. I knew I would see this film but hadn't decided upon IMAX until the day of, and I have to say it was worth it to experience it in the biggest and boldest format for a feature film. As someone who had not read the book, I came in with no preconceived notions about the fundamentals, like WTF a giant maze, really!?! Yes, the trailer does give an indication that it is a test of some sort, but still. So I was contemplating how long would it take for the story to divulge what's behind it all, but I wasn't bored nor was I left feeling neglected by being unfamiliar. The mystery of what was taking place was part of my fascination with this film, working things out along with Thomas. My excitement continued to ebb as I ventured into the maze with him and Minho (Ki Hong Lee) as did my trepidation. This was a good movie, not saying it was great, but I enjoyed it for its entertainment value. I'm usually big on the special effects which has a significant baring on whether I see a film on the big screen or wait for it to come to video, but in this case the effects were not the star, the actors were, which is how it should be done.

The Maze runner is a science fiction action thriller film directed by Wes Ball, based on James Dashner's book with the same name. The movie is no misnomer: it revolves around a bunch of people stuck in a maze, and their struggle with it; with much focus on the one true 'maze runner', Thomas.Is the movie worth a watch? Well, the below list should help you decide that, while you do of course need to factor in your personal preferences in terms of which ones you value more!PROs- 1) Cinematography is the highlight 2) Imagination and creativeness deserves a kudos 3) Actors did a decent job 4) The movie is consistent in all its qualities (good and bad ones!)CONs- 1) Plentiful technical flaws (Its not really possible to mention these without giving away too much of the plot, so lets not mention it here) 2) Many sequences, and in fact much of the movie is predictable 3) I personally found the climax to be dissatisfying (though possibly that's just me!)All in all, I'd say its a good entertaining movie; just don't use your brain too much when you're watching it! :D

What do The Hunger Games, Ender's Game, Divergent and The Maze Runner all have in common?They're based on dystopian YA novels.They're also introductions to a multi-part series.And I never stop hollering about this, but they're all rated PG-13.Which is ultimately The Maze Runner's least redeeming quality.After all, it's my favorite of the four previously mentioned.The MZ's mostly a quality flick.Although the stakes are high, the ratings-board approved shellac is still clearly visible. An educated viewer can't shake the awareness of censorship.For example, during the more harried sequences (mostly involving a battle or pursuit via 'grievers') the filmmakers use the shadowy quick-edits to obscure the violence.Luckily the CGI monsters are shown in full.The 'grievers' are buffalo-sized mechanical beetles. As far as creatures go, they're truly outstanding, original and horrific.The only problem stems from a false hint at the surreal.If you pay close attention, The Maze Runner is an astounding allegory for entering adulthood. This is in keeping with the summer trend of allegorical science fiction, with Snowpiercer (which I do recommend) and The Zero Theorem (which I don't).The plot develops lightning fast. This in turn can lead to confusion.Or maybe I'm just too old for this sort of thriller.So, yes, an elevator shaft is reminiscent of the birth canal.Yes, a labyrinth is a classic metaphor for life.Yes, the supporting characters resemble archetypes.But the mind-bending portion of this thrill ride's a red herring.Because, no, the plot doesn't take place inside the protagonist's head. The viewer need not be concerned with how individual events fit into the self-contained metaphor.Consider the sequence of obstacles Thomas (played by Dylan O'Brien) must overcome while fleeing the first griever. Think about the ways he adapts to the physical environment, the increasing risk and differing tasks required to move forward.A few notes on the acting.The girl, Kaya Scodelario, turns in a solid performance as Teresa. As does Blake Cooper playing Chuck, the protagonist's younger buddy.Thomas Brodie-Sangster (of Game of Thrones fame) plays Newt, punching the thespian clock with efficiency.Will Poulter from We're the Millers plays a bit of a one-note character but executes the role proficiently. I like this guy; he's going places.Patricia Clarkson plays Ava Paige, a mash-up of Glenn Close's Nova Prime in Guardians of the Galaxy and Jodie Foster's Secretary Delacourt in Elysium. Much like Teresa, we learn very little about Ava.The mix of action, suspense and adequate special effects add up to a compelling thriller and a strong entry into the YA novel-turned-film catalogue.See it in IMAX - this is one you won't want to miss.Things aren't looking good for the Ender's Game franchise.However, according to Wikipedia, "Two weeks prior to (The Maze Runner's) release 20th Century Fox decided to move ahead with the sequel and pre-production began in early September 2014 in New Mexico."Whether or not the box office earnings compensate for the $34 million budget, it seems like we'll be seeing a follow-up.If anyone's looking, I'll be in my tent, eagerly awaiting The Scorch Trials.

it was an amazing movie overall, it was totally unexpected from the trailer that it will be too good,specially looking at the cast. One of the best movies in this year. From the start of the movie it was very interesting , every another scenes creates a curiosity as if what will happen next and little bit shaky scary scenes as well :)Overall actors and performance was good as well. Just the end scenes like passing the maze with all the group in one shot was very fast secondly how come gally passed the maze ? he was never a runner and didn't know way to reach the operating area n killing the poor kid anyhow still a must watch movie

I have just watched the movie premier, honestly I was not very enthusiastic as the movie does not have any of those golden name stars, but my daughter was pushing us to watch it because she read the books, for the entire movie we were silent fully attracted to the movie, my daughter told me that the movie has overlooked a lot of details mentioned in the book, but I don't see these details have affected the story, on our way back I was trying to convince her to tell me the summary of the other 2 books, but she refused, so now I have to read the other 2 books, I don't believe I would wait until next year to release the second part.

I have not read this book so this is totally based on the movie. I quite like dtytopian movies however this one was quite disappointing. I never really cared about the characters or felt a connection to them. The "reveal" was lame. The acting was pretty good though. It's not horrible it's just not very good.Some of the fight scenes needed some editing,it was all over the place. You had no idea what was going on!I felt like they showed us too much too soon,I would have liked to have some of the info later in the film,kind of took some of the mystery away. The maze scenes were exciting though,I'll give them that.

Even though the maze runner is indeed 20th century Fox version of the hunger games but I will say that the film itself is different since it seems to offer something different. The story starts off with Dylan o Brian character Thomas being transported from an elevator into a place called the maze. He has no memory of his prior life or why he was there in the first place. However a threat behind the maze walls is called grieves who target the gladers inside the maze, however Thomas starts to realize that perhaps there is a reason outbox the maze and become a runner along Minho. He also encounters a girl from his past named Theresa who holds vital information as to why the maze was created.

The newest YA fantasy adaptation, I went to see this because, one, I hadn't seen a movie in theaters for about a month now and, two, because the trailer set up an intriguing enough mystery that it got me interested. A bunch of teen boys awake without memory to find themselves prisoners in a small glade surrounded by gigantic walls. Beyond the walls lies a maze, and when the doors to the maze close at night, monsters come out of the wall to kill anyone who has remained in the maze. The boys believe there may be an escape in the maze, but are unable to find it as they search throughout the day. When a new kid (Dylan O'Brien) arrives, he is a bit braver than the rest and enters the maze at night, which ends up changing all the rules of the boys' society. This movie offers a bit of fun and excitement, for sure. There are more questions raised than answered, and there seem to me to be some fairly big plot holes. The characters aren't particularly well developed, and, as it moves towards its conclusion (as much as it has one - of course it's a series of novels), it kind of reveals itself to be much closer to The Hunger Games than you might have originally thought. But I did enjoy myself, and I'd recommend it if you like these kinds of movies. It'll play well enough on video.

Let me first say that the maze runner has a much darker tone than the hunger games and those other movies. The movie starts with Tomas(Dylan o'brien)waking up in a box which leads up to the glade.The glade is surrounded by huge stone walls.The walls open every morning and closes at sundown.There are runners who goes in the maze and try to find a way out. when Tomas shows up everything begins to change.The cast is great,if you have read the book,than you would know that it's pretty accurate.The acting is another plus.But the movie seem to drag for a little and the last 10 minutes seem to be weak.To much setup for the next one. overall it's a fun,good movie to watch. It may be a little too much for little kids. 7/10

I will start by saying that I just finished watching this movie today in IMAX and I absolutely loved it. I have seen all of "The Hunger Games" movies and even "Divergent" and I loved those movies as well but there was something about "The Maze Runner" that sucked me into the Universe. I will say that I haven't read the books yet but I now intend to buy the box set after watching this movie just to read them and I'm not a huge reader at all. I loved the acting all the actors did Superb jobs especially "Dylan O' Brian. The action was top-notch from start to finish and the visuals were Awesome. The movie I felt was just the perfect amount of time and although some people complain about the ending I felt the ending fit perfectly with what is to come in the sequel and it had me asking a ton of questions which I don't mind doing at all. I would definitely recommend this movie Hands-Down to any and all fans of the 2 movies I mentioned earlier and if you can watch it in IMAX then do so.

So when I first saw the trailer for the Mazerunner movie and the great reviews on the book, I decided to read the book myself. I thought it was incredibly amazing, it honestly beat the Hunger Games series for me. I eventually ended up reading the two other books to the trilogy; going to buy the prequel soon. FIRST OF ALL, the trailer already was messed up. The biggest change was that the Maze WAS NOT suppose to work that easy to be honest, with that metal device thing they found in that griever. Let me begin with the things I WANTED to see and they SHOULD'VE shown. For some reason, Gally seemed more weak to me in the movie than he was in book. I imagined him completely despising Thomas, like so much hatred was in him that made him insane. While Thomas stuck himself in the Maze with Minho and Alby, MINHO was suppose to show a weak side of him; run away, freak out, cry.. THOMAS was suppose to be the only one to tie up Alby on the vine and THAT was how Minho and him grew so close, how he believed in Thomas so much. That scene in the Maze with them was one that stood out for me in the book- because Minho, being a strong headed tough guy, was weak! He was negative! And that's when Thomas was suppose to change his mind about everything he believed in. I WAS REALLY MAD/DISAPPOINTED THAT I DIDN'T SEE THAT PART. The biggest fail was the way out of the maze.. it was suppose to be more complicated getting out and finding the exit. THE CLIFF. THE CLIFF! That blew my mind in the book- the idea, and I didn't see it, once again! Seriously, some device that leads you to the exit.. how easy compared to the book. There's not really any changes I liked.. I think I would say it was good just cause the casting was awesome. Wish I could've seen the sassy Minho I fell in love with from the book.. and more of Chuck (even if he wasn't one of my favorites) because I didn't really feel for his death in the movie. I'm sure my review would be the complete opposite if I haven't read the book and haven't become such a fan of the series... but books are better than movies anyway. This was a poor adaptation of the book though :/ I also forgot how Newt's limp is really important as well.. because in the last book, he tells Thomas that he tried to commit suicide in the Maze, that he really just hated living, therefore wanting Thomas to kill him when the Flare was getting into him (not being immune, sadly). It was the shuckiest shuck- faced move to not put such important details in the movie from the book. Low expectations for the other movie(s) of the series. The movie was better in my head when I was reading the book, but I absolutely adored the cast, they are amazing and did great jobs of following the script so 7/10 overall but 10/10 cast!!

With a sleepy first hour, the second hour gives glimpse of a superb action movie. A few moments of fabulous acting were seen only during some great action scenes. CGI was used at its best, 10 stars to that, if not for the first half this could have been an unmissable movie. Another good aspect was the diversification of cast from different cultural backgrounds. We rarely get to see a good mix of ethnicity in movies. I personally feel that Kaya Scodelario's role in the move wasn't justified well enough, she could have been omitted. We don't always need a female actor in a male movie, or vice versa. I give it a 7, and you need to watch this if you are up for some good CGI action. If not for the first half this could have been an unmissable movie.

I really liked this movie! I did think that it was made out of practically nothing, but it was still going along with good rhythm and slowly releasing small details that would spin it off completely and add another layer of drama and tragedy to the story.It is a very simple topic though, well told story, which makes this simple topic appealing. The same storytelling that kept everyone paying attention at all times, not to miss a vital detail that might change their path to the whole story.The movie started right with confusion and practically ended like it, which is an element that I don't quite appreciate when I go watch a movie, because I find it rather mortifying. However, since it started dumping a young adult "Thomas" in the middle of nowhere or in the middle of a valley that is surrounded by fortress, with guys that have been living there for THREE years.Like I said I really liked this movie, but it doesn't mean that I agree with every piece of information that was part of the story. Since I didn't read the book I don't think is right to focus on the story's elements and smash them, but I will just disagree with the obvious ones.The story looked to me a little old, in terms watching it after being exposed to "The Hunger Games", "Divergent", "Surrogate", "Alien" and even "Peter Pan" for a little bit; as well as being exposed to any story that contains characters with similar realities, but don't cross my mind right now. Of course they had to make it unique its own technicalities.The cinematography was on point, with Wess Ball leading, as the director. Very creative and fresh vision, having such a great outcome with this talented, fairly new director, another evidence that great directors don't need to be all up in Hollywood flicks to prove who they are. Every actor did a great job, I particularly enjoy watching Dylan O'Brien on the big screen, since the time when I watched "The First Time", he was so telegenic and decent looking. However, I don't love his look in this movie, he looks better with a little more weight on.The special effects in the movie were very realistic, it is clear that the production team put a great effort into plotting this out with vast detail; and for only showing a couple of locations, they kept it interesting.The action sequences were pretty suspenseful, with great music by the hand of John Paesano and following a good pace.However I didn't understand why these people were there for 3 years, we're talking about people that were born to tests and were apparently pretty smart, but couldn't shake the fact that whatever they were doing was not working. Let's say they started sending the runners out after the first year; that still makes it 730 days of trying. I also didn't understand why the characters didn't catch on to the fact that there was a helicopter waiting for them outside the maze, I think it would've been more realistic if one of them would've posed the question about how possible it was that the helicopter could've picked them up at the center of the maze in the first place.There was no need for the film to show that the story continues and mortify us one more time showing that everything was a test and everyone was ready to get to the next level.Again my issues with this movie focused on the story elements and making some sense of what was showed and what wasn't. I still recommend "The Maze Runner" and give it 7 IMDb stars.© 2013 Alexandra Bello

A tribe of young men seek answers in a mysterious, synthetic environment. I enjoyed the setup, and the blunt ground rules of the world itself (we're surrounded by a giant labyrinth that seals itself and shifts mechanically every sundown - don't get caught inside when it does), but the cast is perilously dry and boring, so naturally we spend way too much time getting to know them. Dylan O'Brien is particularly bad as Thomas, a savior who pushes the complacent society to break out of their strongholds and pursue a method of escape. His is a special kind of anti-charisma, blank and wooden and static... stupid handsome, like an underwear model. Occasional jaunts into the maze itself are the real draw of this film, and clearly the most entertaining bits, but they're bafflingly few and far between. Why revel in the atmosphere when instead you could be setting up sequels with a set of fatally-flawed characters, I guess? Not that the plot is all that competent, either. Think too hard and you'll surely slip into one of the broad holes scattering its landscape. It's a middling effort in every sense of the word. Outside of the maze itself, which is a nice (if brief) breath of clear air, the rest of this film's concepts and ideas have already been done many times before, by more complete rivals. Even the CG-heavy monsters don't trigger a reaction - I think I recognized them from the lower levels of hell in Doom 2, circa 1994

I must admit I really missed the kind of movie where a bunch of kids go for an adventure and here it is, The Maze Runner. Well not really that the kids want to be there, they are put there. However still the movie satisfies me.To be precise, this is an adventure post-apocalyptic dystopian thriller (at least I would define it as such). And unlike Hunger Games, this one lacks all the political stuff (at least in this episode!) and instead focuses on the action and character development.The movie clearly points out in the end that there would be a sequel, but that's all. Everything the end teases with is that the next episode will focus on putting the kids into another big trouble and that's it. So no spoilers really.I will try to keep this out of any spoilers too, so will instead focus on only what the trailer suggests. And as the trailer shows, this movie is about a group of kids put into the centre of a maze which they have to explore and survive and meanwhile have to solve their own conflicts. None of the kids remembers anything, except in few days after they are put into the maze they remember just their name. From this point on starts the adventure. This is everything you will see in the trailer. Based on this alone, the movie flashed three things inside me immediately - "Labyrinth" (1986, David Bowie) - The Maze Runner is written in 2007, but who does not remembers "The Labyrinth"? That was such a huge movie from my childhood. I still own it on blu-ray and the soundtrack on original CD and listen to it often. And I am not the only one, I am sure. And I am sure James Dashner, the author of the Maze Runner books was heavily been inspired by this movie, just he decided to make it darker. Nothing wrong really.Yes, the movie is based on books, but I never read them. If you just watch the movie you will experience one well narrated story, enough dose of unknown to make you puzzled and wait for the answers to appear, nice effects and not bad music.The most disappointing for me was the absence of a teaser after the credits. But I can live with it. After all I really enjoyed the movie.Now as I said, the movie flashed three things inside me and "Labyrinth" (1986) was the first one. Okay, the difference was that in "Labyrinth" they put Jennifer Connelly in the outskirts of the maze, while here they put the kids in the centre. The other two things however were the kids themselves.The main actor, Dylan O'Brien looks exactly like a very young version of Jean-Claude Van Damme. I am sure he can't do the Van Damme split, but he really does look like him. Maybe a version of Van Damme before "Breakin" (Yes, Van Damme does appear in "Breakin" too).The other thing is, this movie really flashes back a resemblance to "The Goonies" (1985) to me, because of Blake Cooper. This kid really resembles Chunk from the Goonies (Jeff Cohen). I don't know why, but he is one of the most memorable characters to be from The Maze Runner. Maybe because he is so different from the others.As I said, I really enjoyed the movie. What I miss is just a little more character development, which I hope to see in the next episode. And I really want somehow Blake Cooper back in the team!!My final verdict - a very enjoyable teen movie!

When it comes to young adult (or YA) books-turned-films, I usually tend to ignore such when they release into movie theaters and try to rent it on DVD when it's available. However, upon reading several positive reviews from a few notable top movie critics regarding the genre's latest movie adaptation 'The Maze Runner,' I decided to give it a shot to see if their reviews live up to what they had seen on screen. By the time I walked out of the theater I remained puzzled, yet my expectations were met and I was growing eager on what lies ahead for the main characters.The story about an amnesiac youth named Thomas is sent into a giant maze surrounded by other trapped boys calling themselves the Glade. Although he tries to regain his lost memories as well as figuring out why he and his fellow captives are there to begin with, he finds out that for the past three years, the Glade routinely sends out Runners to find a way out of the difficult labyrinth. To solve this mystery, they must work together (along with a girl who seems to have ties with Thomas) and escape the perilous, constantly-shifting path waiting before them, or be forever trapped like rats in a maze.Unlike the previous abundance of YA (female dominated) book-turned-films that proved unappealing and leaning mostly towards predictability (with the exception of 'Harry Potter' and 'The Hunger Games'), I best describe this movie adaptation of James Dashner's famed book series as an intricately dark premise, yet engaging in content. It's one of those YA rarities that actually turn up as successful to both critics and audiences, but seems to now have its aim toward the male half among the large abundance of female audiences. Lead star Dylan O'Brien (of MTV's Teen Wolf) delivered such a believable and interesting performance as memory-impaired Thomas as he tries to discover his true purpose by stepping up and proving his worth among his fellow captives. Actor Will Poulter also created quite a game changer in this role compared to his previous films ('Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader,' 'We're the Millers') as tough guy Gally. While the only female lead Kaya Scodelario balanced out the seriousness and the sensitivity among the Glade members as Teresa. As a whole, it seems to have the dystopian, thrilling elements of 'The Hunger Games' crossed with the male-driven survival themes of 'Lord of the Flies' with ominous tones of NBC's 'Revolution.' Since it's basically composed of an almost entirely male cast of characters (save for the only female lead), there are moments I've noticed where some scenes still remain unclear and need to be re-watched to understand it carefully. The tension and adrenaline just kept building up as more uncertainties within the bewildering labyrinth are explored, from encountering ferocious creatures called Grievers to the frequently-shifting walls that form new pathways to different sections, and a mysterious organization called W.C.K.D. With all these elements, including a strong cast and story, it has the potential to reach the ranks of the few significant others in the pool of YA film adaptations. Can't wait to see what the movie's sequel has to offer. It definitely follows the trail left behind by 'The Hunger Games.' Needless to say, the trials have barely just begun.

*Cue* This is more of a rant than a review, but I've seen worse on here. - - - The book is great. Read it. The movie. . .? Eh, well we're getting to that. The director, producer, and a few of the cast say that the adaptions were going to be to the 'fans liking'. I think not. TO me, although in some strange circumstances is close to impossible, a book-to-movie adaption should be a close to the book as possible. Here they did little to nothing of the sort.A few examples: They keep saying, 'three years' instead of 'two years'-- this fact was very much established in the first book and so on. --My opinion- they put it in there to have it be more dramatic. PLEASE never do that again.Many of the character designs were the unexpected. This one is self-explanatory.Many of the characters switch their roles.Example: In a scene from the book which was excluded completely from the movie, a Griever gets into the Glade and scales up the Homestead wall-- in which the ultimate conclusion is-- Alby dies. Gally was supposed to die in that scene. . . But naw. Shuck it. We'll make Alby die (Although, in retrospect, in almost every movie I've scene--the black guy/guys/girl dies first. Although it wasn't that case here, surprisingly...)And lastly, the camp's design. Sticks and rocks. Yeah. No stone. No concrete. Just sticks. Poles. And rocks. Even the Homestead seems to have suffered, being it is now degraded, from the third little pig's brick house, down to his little brother's; a stick house. Yeah. Sticks. And the Map Room. Now sticks. Made of STICKS. And it very clearly says, many times, and I quote, from The Maze Runner book-- "iron door of the Map Room". Can you put a iron door on a house of sticks? You could, but to no actual success. - - Conclusion-Movie sucks.

Didn't read the books. I did read The Hunger Games, and enjoyed books and movies. This one had its great moments, but overall fell a little flat for me - but I think that's an age issue. A generational problem. Not that I am too old to appreciate rebellion and questioning authority, but rather because I've seen all the "Maze" tropes a hundred times before.Recycling old tropes isn't a bad thing, nor am I implying it's some kind of art crime! Rather, I am just noting that anyone over 35 may find it a bit old hat and even tired by now??? I'd have to add books to the list of "The Maze" forerunners - Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," Michael Creighton books, and others I can't recall now. And all the "Mad Max" movies - "Logan's Run," "Lathe of Heaven," and of course "Lord of the Flies." Even 1990's fare such as "Water World" and "The Postman" echo a bit here. And other movies I can't remember. Add the iconoclastic vibe, taking down The Man and The Establishment, and unethical experimentation and manipulation by The-Powers-That-Be, and you might already be wearied of "The Maze" before you even get to the cinema.In some ways "The Maze" has a trick ending, and relies too much of corny plot twists - "Surprise!" wears thin. I could imagine that once someone knew the trick ending, the movie would be unwatchable. It would be way too silly, way too tedious and dull. Virtually unendurable to sit through. That's never a good sign for a movie.Katniss - she still holds interest, together with the whole Panem bunch for me!!! So I am not "anti" anything. I just want a newer, fresher approach is all. If you're young - and this is your first exposure to these themes - go see "The Maze" and go nuts and enjoy yourself! If you're a grown-up - don't expect anything new or fresh, or startling. It just isn't there.

Saw it tonight with my teen, who read the book. I was on the edge of my seat for the whole film. It was fast-paced and a LOT of fun to watch. The star was great. And I liked the whole setup. Toward the end, though, you felt like you needed a really good reason for them all to have been put in a big field in the middle of a maze, and I didn't feel like any explanation worked. Maybe they will explain it better in the next movie. I sure hope so, because I don't want to read the books. But my son tells me that it wasn't explained any better there. I mean: OK, so they are trying to find strong people to withstand a virus. But they already have the cure, so what's the point? And if the point was to study them with the virus in them, then why make it so difficult to GIVE them the virus? Very strange. The grievers --while fun and scary -- made no sense as a way to deliver the virus. So I was a bit lost at the end. BUT like I said, the movie was so fast-paced that you weren't given much time to think about all that stuff, so I enjoyed it.

The Maze Runner is an action packed, visually stunning new film that made hold my breath and kept me on the edge of my seat till the very end. The Maze Runner tells the story of Thomas, played by Dylan O'Brien, who wakes up in a giant crate with no memory of his passed. He is taken to "The Glade," a place full of boys who were taken and had their memories erased as well. Thomas soon learns that they are trapped in a giant maze, and once you're stuck inside, you never make it out alive. Everything begins to change when a girl is brought to the Glade and so Thomas decides it is time to face the maze and find the whole truth about the people who placed them there. But the truth they find might be even more horrible than the maze itself.I absolutely love this film. It is so intense and visually stunning. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made my heart race through the entire the film. Every time Thomas is inside the maze, I felt as if I was there with him, running for my life. But this isn't just an adrenaline packed adventure. The Maze Runner also moved me to tears and made me think about the way we can work together when we are truly faced with a challenge. The visuals are incredible as well. The maze is so complex and ever changing and it's so cool to be able to "explore" it in a sense and see all of the detail put into the CGI. The entire cast is incredible. All the characters are so unique and have their own personality and quirks, but they work together in such a seamless way. My favorite character is Thomas played by Dylan O'Brien. He is the main character in this film and really makes the whole thing come to life. The boys that live in the Glade have been there for three years and, of course, they have tried to find a way out. But, most of them have essentially decided that they will live out the rest of their days there. When Thomas shows up, he tests the system and refuses to accept his fate of being stuck in the maze. I admire his character because he thinks outside of the box and finds his own way. He looks past his fear and is a strong leader despite the doubts people may have in him.It's been very interesting seeing the theme of films that have been coming out recently. Hunger Games, Divergent, Enders Game, The Giver and now The Maze Runner all have something in common. They tell the story of young adults, children really, who have to group together and take on some very serious situations, sometimes things even adults can't handle. It shows youth questioning authority, standing up for what's right and making their own way. These strong themes send out a message of empowerment to the youth of our generation, but this can also be a bit overwhelming. I know it's difficult watching adults fight for their lives, kill and be killed, and have their worlds torn apart. But it's even more shocking to see children go through these trials.Because of this, I recommend The Maze Runner for ages 13+ because of the intense situations and violence. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made me hold my breath during the intense situations, and I love when a film gets me so involved, but that may be too much for some to handle. I give The Maze Runner 5 out of 5 stars and can't wait to see it again. Catch it in theaters near you now!Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Well another movie that based upon another best-selling novel , it seems that Hollywood are full of this kind of movie now days such as Beautiful Creatures , Mortal Instrument , I Am Number Four or even The Hunger Games .The Problem is yes some of this type of movie works but much more of it fails to deliver for example Beautiful Creatures that actually has an interesting idea but the way it tell the story is just not working when it on the screen and it's pretty much failed.I have to say that i haven't read the book before so this review will come from my experience entirely on the movie (Even though i know before go to see it that it actually has a sequel) .The Maze Runner is a movie that's actually has an interesting idea like others Bases upon Novel movies , It talks about Thomas who trapped in this Huge Maze and they has to find the way out of this Maze.So the idea of unique and complicated Maze is there but the problem with this movie is it's has a really bad mindset of which way it's going to go , it's like the movie know that it have to have another sequel so they focus and spend a lot of time to set-up the sequel and that's okay but the problem is when they focus too much and spend too much time on set-up the sequel , they actually forget to spend time in this movie as well which mean everything in this movie feel rush and half-ass instantly , everything just come and goes really quickly without you really knowing why and that's not only affect on the story telling it also affect everything in this movie.Such as the characters that feels rush and you just barely even know anyone at all you maybe remember 3 or 4 characters but that's actually it , meanwhile when other characters dies you will just like "who the hell is that" and the main character Thomas even call their name which makes me think " Exactly when did they even talk to each other ?" .Another Hugh Problem with this movie is the main reason behind all of this event that happen in the movie is just "Absurd" i'm not sure when you read the book you maybe can understand and get that but when it actually on the movie it's just feels so over the top non-sense and when you top that up with rushing storytelling it become even worst.Even though the movie has a pretty good chasing/running scene that pretty exciting and the leading actor Dylan O'Brien doing pretty good job , it's just not enough to make up for really rushing storytelling that just ruined everything in the movie especially The Maze that feels nothing like a Maze it's has no complicated and mystery what so ever in the last 30 minutes of the movie you will even see the characters just walk in and out like shopping mall this is by far the most unforgiving thing in this movie , if your movie call "The Maze Runner" make sure you make the Maze actually a Maze not just some hallway stuff that have no unique to each area and boring as much as possible.When i'm reviewing this it's actually announced that this movie will have at least another sequel coming 2015 and that's makes me concern , i have to say that The Maze Runner have a HUGE potential but it just failed really hard to deliver because of how much they rush the storytelling to set-up another sequel , i hope they will spend more time on next one and actually make it works or else it will fall to the same problem over and over again.

. . . in which the contestants are slightly younger and do a better job of keeping their clothes on, MAZE RUNNER would NOT last long on the "boob tube." MAZE RUNNER's tribal councils are too short, and the lack of an immunity idol takes away most of the suspense. Biomachines probably were "old hat" by the time the original ALIEN flick was released, and the HARRY POTTER franchise exhausted any possibilities for giant spiders left open by THE LORD OF THE RINGS series. HUNGER GAMES, DIVERGENT, and THE GIVER all have carefully-crafted "back stories" that make honest attempts to establish a Screen Reality. MAZE RUNNER would be less unfair to consumers if its ads were required to have "black box" disclaimers stating, "Do NOT expect to enjoy this movie if you have not read the book first!!" Throwing in some last-minute Dystopian gibberish from a previously unseen elderly White actress who seems destined to be revealed as a VISITORS-style Lizard Lady in Part Four of the MAZE "trilogy" would only confuse anyone with an attention span not up to reading long book series BEFORE coming to the multiplex (assuming they were still paying any attention to the final half hour of this misfire).

I was just saying the other day that this has been a generally poor year for good movies. Luckily today I just watched the movie of the year. It kind of reminded me of a cross between Hunger games and The cube, which are both excellent movies. I loved everything about this movie. Before the ending it was a 8 out of 10 and it could go either way but the ending was brilliant and it left we wanting more but it also satisfied my need for a good ending. When they shipped in the girl I was thinking oh, here comes the romance part but it didn't and I am so thankful for it! I do not got one bad word to say about it and I can't wait for the next in the series!

After following the Maze Runner for several months I was excited to finally have a chance to watch the film, and I have to say that I was pleasantly satisfied. As a fun Summer popcorn flick, The Maze Runner effectively kept me engaged throughout. The main protagonist, Thomas, played by Dylan O'Brien, is easy to root for as he struggles to uncover the secrets of the Maze. O'Brien's performance is compelling yet not over the top; often these post-apocalyptic films can suffer from protagonists that are far too melodramatic. Ki Hong Lee, as Minho, was probably the most refreshing character out of the bunch. It's obvious when you're watching the film that the filmmakers want you to notice Minho, but the film does a very good job with slowly introducing him, balancing out a level of mystique and curiosity in regards to who Minho is and what he already knows about the Maze. In addition to the two main leads, Aml Ameen and Will Poulter, who respectively portrays Alby and Gally, offers interesting personality dichotomies which further enhances the difficult obstacles that Thomas, our main protagonist, must face head-on as he uncovers the awful secrets of the Maze. Lastly one of the most intimidating and menacing characters in this film is the Maze itself. The filmmakers have done a excellent job giving life to this inanimate killing machine, constantly leaving me wondering what new and sadistic traps lied ahead for the seemingly helpless runners. If character development is one of Maze Runners strongest suits than the actual plot is likely the Achilles heel. That being said, the plot isn't a complete mess, however, there were moments that left me scratching my head, releasing me from the world of the Maze, which was disappointing since the world itself was utterly captivating. While I watched the film I couldn't help myself to draw comparisons to the Lord of the Flies and the Hunger Games. The community within the Maze will probably draw heavy comparisons to the characters and dilemmas that were portrayed in the Lord of the Flies novel. As for the Hunger Games comparisons, The Maze Runner affectionately tries to replicate it's bigger brother's tone and mood, and possibly it's success, by shooting the film in a similar style, i.e. film grains, shaky camera, and etc. But overall neither of these comparisons hurt the film at all, actually it perpetuated my fondness for the film since I'm a fan of both source materials. When it comes down to it, the Maze Runner plays it safe, following the typical Hollywood clichés that have succeeded within the genre, at the same time effectively giving me as a viewer something new. This film is far from revolutionary, but expect to see a growing franchise that will hopefully learn from some of it's initial mistakes and expand upon it's own source material, and maybe challenge the likes of the Hunger Games franchise.

Let's paint a familiar picture: your sitting at a diner, sipping on a Coke through a straw while mom and dad talk about plans for whos going to meet up with grandma. Your only eight years old with no cell phone; so how did you pass the time? You played with that paper placemat that every restaurant that was family orientated had. Some had that easy word search that hid easy messages like "fries" and gumball" and some had an unfunny cartoon that was printed with the hope that the child would laugh anyway. What most had was the classic maze.I myself have a couple of memories of holding a free crayon offered by the waitress and tracing my way though an uneven pattern that would lead me to the exit. These were easy, but I had fun solving them, giving me a sense of accomplishment before I dived into a hot dog. What makes the maze puzzle so unique is that I think this may be the first example of a virtual game. Despite only using a pen to guide the way, you were thrown into network where your only goal was to get out. Solve the maze and you feel like you could take on another to prove that you were such a master. Let's see you solve the death trap that is in The Maze Runner. Sixteen-year-old Thomas (played by Dylan O'Brian) wakes up to find himself in an ascending cage which opens to a lush field and several other boys around his age. They collect the other boxes that came with him and the second in command Newt (played by Thomas Brodie- Sangster) tells Thomas about the way of life and their positions. Most of the boys farm and gather but a few select venture into a large maze that surround them. They are called the runners.As Thomas begins to accept the community way of life, he accidentally gets left out in the maze when trying to save the others (the maze closes it's gates at night as monsters fill the track). He manages to survive the nightfall and save his friends life. This grants him status as a runner, to the dismay of the group's leader Gally (played by Will Poulter). As Thomas starts to learn about mapping the maze, a girl arrives in the cage along with a note that reads "the last one ever". This puts more pressure to find a way through the treacherous puzzle before they run out of food and time. The Maze Runner is another young adult novel getting it's turn at a movie adaptation. What certainly separates this from the others is that this one is more boy orientated. Sort of a cross between the lost boys of Peter Pan and The Prisoner TV series, The Maze Runner was a lot better then I thought it could have been. The situation is more interesting and easier to follow then this year's Divergent and it's cast of young men shape it to be a better performance piece.Exceptthere's only one problem with the characters and it's a major one; the main character. Thomas is really bland and forgettable and is just the generic nice hero. I don't know if the actor Dylan is the issue as he does have a regular role on MTV's Teen Wolf (I can't justify this as I've never seen the show); but you know it's a problem if the side characters are more memorable. As is, Thomas Brodie-Sangster makes for a good sidekick (so much so that I wish he were the focus) and Will Poulter is starting to show more acting skills (proven before in We're the Millers).I'll give this seven hard mazes out of ten. The Maze Runner could have been as good as The Hunger Games had it casted a better performer or simply had a better character to put the focus on, but for a fun Friday night at the movies, I'll take it for entertainment's sake. This could have been worse.

The best way to describe this film with one word is "boring". bad actors, plot full of holes, a lot of plot elements are plain stupid, all the "action" scenes either lack enough logic or are simply cliché. If you are expecting anything NEARLY as good as "the cube" you will be in for a disappointment. Although the movie shares a similar concept the boring to death actors and the complete absurdity of it all bury all viewer expectations way before the end. And what's worse most of the movie is pretty much a soap opera. Yet another Hollywood sewer dump for the teenage audience, and I frankly don't see this garbage being anywhere near a blockbuster even with the less intelligent crowd. The movie does have potential, but the director doesn't. Like, at all.

Well, how should I put it. First of all, I don't read the book so this is my review solely based on the movie. I think it's good, but that's all... it's not impressive. Still with all respect, I don't find any of the characters have an attractive or interesting personality... I can't feel sympathy for them, the best character still... is Chuck, even him... I feel has weak character in the movie (they are just so typical, and typical in movie is boring in my opinion). And then, the story is actually interesting in the end, but that's all and it's because I want to know why they are there in the first place. After finding out, I was like... "Okay, so that's why." And like I said, that's all... I don't really want to know anymore. Well, if there's the sequel there are like 30-40% chance I'd go watch it. That's my opinion.

I'm not the reader of the novel, I'm not a fan of these kind of movies, The Maze Runner might be not over-hyped like the other typical movie was. But this movie really made me want to go to the cinema after I saw one of the posters. I mean "wow, another adventure thriller movie!"After I watch this movie, my expectation was wrong, this movie is focused to the chosen people that living inside the safe zone of the maze called Glade,and the dangerous side of the maze is guarded with the poisonous monster. Someone who can go to the maze is "The Runner". The main character is Thomas, the teenager that being lifted up to the glade and obviously he didn't know anything because they have been brainwashed before entering the Glade.The presentation of this movie is good and satisfying, my expectation along this movie is some people who trapped on the labyrinth and find the way out. But it's not like that, the 50-50 balance between scene of the glade and the maze is surely a tense for me and it's good. The plot is amazing. Wes Ball made this movie completely end with the title of "The Maze". Even though this movie is a trilogy, this movie is worth to watch for you guys.

Another dystopian movie with children being put through hell for 'the greater good'? No thank you. The movie raises far more questions than it answers and to make things worse, it demands you return for a sequel for 'potential' answers. Other notable movies like 'The Lord of the Rings', 'The Hunger Games', 'Harry Potter' leave questions between films, BUT they don't start a million new questions in the closing minutes of the movie, they all had some sort of closure. Aside from all the unanswered questions, most of the excitement comes from the mystery of the maze, but it is unfortunately overshadowed by the annoying struggle between the inhabitants. The fact that the inhabitants are given a CHOICE to either run the maze or stay and live their lives trapped takes away any sense of urgency. They should be all trying to solve the maze and a way out, but instead they are docile, submissive characters, accepting defeat. Characters on 'LOST' and 'Lord of the Flies' are FORCED to build a society because they have no other alternative, unlike 'The Maze Runner'. Katniss in 'The Hunger Games' is FORCED to kill and survive, which makes the movie more tense and exciting, which yet again makes 'The Maze Runner' feel less appealing. Characters in 'The Maze Runner' have the ability to potentially solve their captivity, but they basically chose not to, where's the excitement in that? In the end, the movie unfortunately solves the mystery of the maze (bittersweet in a sense) and now tells us that phase two has begun, which makes the entire movie now seem completely pointless. The driving force of the movie is the maze and now that that mystery has been solved, the future installments feel completely thin without such an obstacle based on these characters.Full Review at: http://www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/09/the-maze-runner-2014.html

This film...What was i expecting? maze challenges!! thats what the name suggests...however i feel i am disappointed....this is hunger games#1 mark 3....similar story history and because of this rather disappointing... for obvious reasons i am nothing going too in depth... watch it on DVD do not see it at cinema!Hollywood is clutching at straws here... Perhaps next year there will be some better writers... At the moment, you never feel like you connect with the protagonists! its more a jaunt round a sand pit with dinner at evil grannys than a film which is meant to raise emotions.... the British kid who dies (lol can u guess who??) is OK.... he has come far! but he is capable of more and this film for any of the participants never encapsulates their abilities... let me direct i will have a better chance!

A kid wakes up memory-less to some boys, all similarly memory-less, in The Glade, a clearing surrounded by walls of a maze. He remembers his name Thomas as he learns about The Glade; every morning the maze door opens to different sections changing each week, and closes every evening, monsters called Grievers roam the maze at night killing anyone inside, their sting makes the victim go kind of berserk, it's been three years since the first boy came here, every day 'runners' explore the maze looking for an exit to no avail. When a runner is stung by a Griever and sent to die in the maze, The leader Alby goes into the maze retracing the path. Alby returns wounded, carried by the lead runner Minho, just as the door closes. Thomas runs to them, helping to hide Alby from Grievers. He and Minho trick and squash a Griever. The next morning the 'box' elevator shocks everyone, sending a girl with a note "She's the last one EVER". Newt, the second in command, decides to punish Thomas for going into the maze but makes him a runner for the next morning. Thomas and Minho retrieve a device from the Grievr carcass. They then match the device to the maze map pattern. The girl Teresa wakes up and talks to Thomas, giving two syringes which Thomas figures out as Alby's cure. Thomas goes to his punishment when the night comes. The next morning, Thomas and Minho reenter the maze, finding new paths with the device. As they go back, the door doesn't close and Grievers attack that night. After that, Thomas uses a Griever tail to sting himself, discovering after Alby wakes up that it helps return some memory back. Injected with the last syringe, Thomas wakes up knowing he and Teresa were part of the people who put them all in there. Gally, the third in command, decides to offer Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers. But the Gladers are divided; some support Gally while the others want follow Thomas out of there. Thomas' group retrace the new path and Teresa enters the code from the map while the Griievers attack. They escaped and found labs with dead scientists. A video explains what happens; the Gladers were test subjects for brain activity to find a cure for the Flare, a virus attacking the brain, happening after the apocalyptic disaster years ago. But the final scene reveals that there are still more than meets the eye.The story plot looks like an attempt to even more dramatize the novel's original plot. It changes the novel's story quite significantly, opting out some details and thus inevitably changing the nature of some of the significant characters and their roles in the story. In the movie, the story changes from one that has great emphasize to the individual characters and their relationships, to one that only thinks about the characters getting out of the maze.Having only one female in the significant character roster, the movie tries to insert a significant dose of action sequences. This enables it to be recognized as an action genre, and also adding up the ingredients to attract the male young adult viewers, the demography less targeted by most movie releases. It will surely be a great move if only the action sequences are that good. Instead, within the all running actions we only see the characters run, merely run, without any real variation in their moves. The slightest variation comes when the Griever attacks come in. And even those scenes only present the boys to be clueless in what they're doing.The mystery aura is quite well kept for about half of the duration. It's done using the medium paced flow and all those "I only know this" dialog lines. It's still looked maintained for the rest of the duration, but as the focus slightly yet surely shift to the more action oriented sequences, with faster paced story flow, the mystery feels reduced of it's significance.The acting is just a decent overall performance. Having no senior names on the cast sure takes it's toll in the mentoring of the young talents. Dylan O'Brien does his first lead role In a big-budget movie doesn't really disappoint. It's just that the whole movie doesn't seem to have a solid bound over everything it offers. Kaya Scodelario fails to make her only female character in the story to stand out although she did quite okay. Will Poulter used his experience to be confident, yet sometimes over-acted, on his role here.My say s that The Maze Runner (2014) deserves a 6 out of 10 from me. A recommendation is just a so-so option from me. This movie is quite an entertainment, yet it falls a little bit short of adequate satisfactory.

I went into this film with low expectations. Having never read any of James Dashner's books, I cannot tell with any certainty if the screenwriters were true to the novel, or if the book makes a better effort than the film to distinguish itself from the multitude of superior films it meekly attempts to imitate. What I know is that I left the theater laughing. And not in a good way.What should have been an exciting and visceral tale of survival and intrigue ended up stealing two hours of my life by conning me into thinking I would see something original. Instead of suspense and excitement, MAZE RUNNER laid out an entourage of familiar tropes, paper-thin characters, and contrived situations. The 'villainous' antagonist of the film was as one-dimensional and irrationally-plot serving as any character I've ever seen. The character was so silly and unbelievable I actually chuckled at him several times when the film begged me to be serious. The screenplay was a crash-course in heavy-handed exposition. It was jammed with stock lines: bland, insinuating lines that were supposed to put me on the edge of my seat but instead left me thinking, 'Okay, when are we going to get to the POINT of this movie?' We got to see the intimidating-jerk-who-doesn't-listen-to-reason character, the hardened-guy-who-will-later-be-reduced-to-a-weak-state-to-show-us how-shaken-up-the-best-of-us-can-get character, the arbitrary female (although, thankfully, fewer movies today are marginalizing women), the amnesiac/s, and the innocent-character-we-can-get-away-with-killing. The pacing of the film, if not the events, were completely predictable and the ending (which I came to the theater curious for in the first place) came off as stale and forced, like the rest of the ponderous placeholder scenes that served as a plot. If you've seen movies such as HUNGER GAMES, CABIN IN THE WOODS, or PANDORUM, you have already witnessed better characters, better reveals, and more assured examples of plot development.Hollywood has developed a very convenient formula to keep theaters full of impressionable teen audiences. We have an outsider who needs to find a part of the group to cling to. They meet a variety of similar sympathetic characters. They act impulsively, which is usually a good thing. They are almost always rebellious and independent by nature, but they need to avoid arousing the wrath of whatever all-powerful conglomerate is hell-bent on keeping them down. Until, of course, the time comes to overthrow them using the various talents that the group possesses. Along with a healthy dose of courage, resolve... and luck. Buckets of ludicrous, gratuitous, convenient, plot-serving luck.There is no reason that this film should have made the money it has. After six days, it has recouped its budget threefold. Every ticket you buy gives them more ammunition for a brain-numbing cookie-cutter sequel. I'm not saying the film is the worst I've ever seen. But for God's sake, we don't need any more movies like this. Here's to a better future.

'The Maze Runner, based on the first part of James Dashner's young-adult post-apocalyptic sci-fi trilogy, is a good and interesting start to the series. It has enough thrills and twists to keep you intrigued and on-the-edge till the end. The cast, which is almost entirely filled with teenagers, has done quite a commendable job and help making the dystopian scenario quite believable.The plot may seem like one of those stories you've heard time and again, but it does have new and interesting things to offer. Since there are so many characters, their development is quite limited. Few of the answers regarding the plot are answered towards the end; maybe, the remaining answers are left for the sequels.I would have no issues if this becomes a big movie franchise like 'The Hunger Games' simply because it's much better than other big movie franchises of the past, like The Twilight Series.

The story makes no sense, whatsoever! Nada! Nothing! Not in the slightest. To make matters worse, the ending was nothing more then prepping the audience for a sequel! It was so in your face it was insulting. You mean the audience won't have a clue as to why all those innocent people died unless you come back and waste another 12 dollars! Wow! I will be avoiding any future sequel like the plague! The Maze Runner also reflects the sterile and chaste expectations of the American movie going audience. For starters, you have young men living together as a colony for up to as long as three years and they all have perfect haircuts! Give me a break! I couldn't believe how well groomed they all were. Did they have a hair stylist pop in from in from another dimension on a regular basis? And how could they all be so clean shaven? Did they bring razors and shaving cream with them? None of these men have delayed puberty problems that I could tell. LOL! Some of them must have developed facial hair after years of being stranded. But what bothered me most was what great shape their clothes were in. These are young men in there late teens and early 20's. Did they bring a seamstress and a washing machine with them, too!? They are supposed to be living like Robinson Crusoe, not like George Jetson! In this entire awful film there was only one single moment of humor. Even worse it has zero sexuality. Here's all these incredibly good looking and physically fit young men and we don't see a single one of them with their shirt off for a second! Why is non-stop violence, intense screaming and even murder OK, but not showing off the male body? Why have we become such a warped and sterile society where death and violence doesn't offend in the slightest, but God forbid you show a single male nipple or hairy armpit?

'THE MAZE RUNNER': Four Stars (Out of Five) Another Young-Adult book adaptation; this one is based on the first novel (of the same name) in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi trilogy, by writer James Dashner. The film tells the story of a sixteen-year-old boy who wakes up in the center of a maze, inhabited by other teenage boys, and is surrounded by viscous mechanical monsters. It was directed by first-time feature filmmaker Wes Ball and written by first-time feature film writers Noah Oppenheim, Grant Pierce Myers and T.S. Nowlin. The movie stars Dylan O'Brien (of TV's 'TEEN WOLF' fame), Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Aml Ameen, Blake Cooper, Kaya Scodelario and Will Poulter. I found it to be pretty entertaining, and well-made, for a YA movie! O'Brien plays Thomas; a sixteen-year-old kid who wakes up in an old elevator, in the middle of a grassy clearing, surrounded by other teenage boys. He has no memory of who he is, or how he got there, but he does remember his name, after getting in a fight with another boy (Poulter), the first night. He soon learns that all of the other boys awoke in a similar fashion and they've built a community there, which they call the Glade. He also finds out that 'the Glade' is at the center of a deadly maze, surrounded by vicious monsters. No one has ever made it out of there alive but designated 'runners' investigate the constantly changing maze everyday, before it's doors close at night. With the arrival of Thomas things start to change, for the better and worse, for the first time.The film is a little like a cross between 'LORD OF THE FLIES' and 'LOST'. It's of course not nearly as interesting, or thrilling, as either of those cult classics but it is kind of like a YA merging of them. For a movie based on a popular teen book it is pretty dark and suspenseful. The premise is engaging and the acting is all decent enough. The film is definitely not nearly as good as the best YA movies (like 'THE HUNGER GAMES' or 'DIVERGENT') but it is better than most. Hopefully the sequels (with bigger budgets) will be even better. I'll be there.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/SWKktTowhSI

I was lucky enough to get early screening of one of my most anticipated films this year. Well, here it it and I've seen all I needed. The Maze Runner is adaptation of James Dashner's post apocalyptic bestseller about youngsters, who are imprisoned inside the mysterious maze and their struggle of living together, while trying to escape this nightmare. Movie opens with Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) waking up in the cage, that moves pretty fast upwards, right into iron doors. He is confused, he remembers nothing and does not understand how he got in here. When the cage reaches top, it suddenly stops and then he sees a very bright light and some young boys staring at him. Now, he is even more confused.If you are not a book reader, like me, you can be also confused, even though trailer told most of it. But not that much to lose interest how it goes. Because, you know, most of movie in this genre are well predictable stories, just with actors who we are delighted to see on a big screen and some sentiments also. As the plot starts to open up, Thomas starts remembering some small details, it get more interesting. Later, The Maze Runner also suggest whole load of action, chasing and good fantasy. Without going into the deep of story, it has pretty much predictable ending. I've never read the book, but I was absolutely sure where it would go. But here, let me explain things I liked.First of all, it's entertaining. Whatever we say, how stupid and "yeah-I've-seen-this-before" type movie it is, TMR makes us have fun, from Dylan O'Brien's abs (still, too much shirts) to well shot action scenes. There is nothing outrageously illogical, or stupid in this film, it just follows some well known plots of Animal Farm (George Orwell) and Cube. First is similar because it shows how people behave when they are locked up on their own, how they need to have a leader and other psychological. But film does not go too deep into Orwell's issues. It reminded me Cube because of idea, that there are some people out there who lock up absolute strangers in dangerous environment and then "watch" them suffering. Maybe the idea here is a little different, but the 90's classic still kept popping out in my mind.I liked the cast. Leaving alone my favorite Dylan, who I'll talk about later, it was nice to see some recognizable faces like Thomas Brodie-Sangster of Game of Thrones, Will Poulter of We're the Millers and Narnia. Both were definitely good and especially Poulter who played an conservative leader who more focused on staying there alive than going out of the maze. He had some good moments of anger and his eyebrows perfectly coped with it.Technically, movie was well done and paced. It kept motion and action all the time, especially in the second half of film. The Maze scenes were well shot, with some massive production design. Editing worked for me too, it's not masterful, but good enough to enjoy the almost two hour movie.What I did not get is the aliens, these boys were hiding from. In fact, they were robots, but hell looked like intruders from Alien. But in post apocalyptic world, everything is possible.Dylan O'Brien is good in here. He has not done anything other actor of the same appearance would not have done, but he was good. Right in the character. Basically, he was the reason I could not wait for the Maze Runner and as long as I had enough of him, I'm satisfied.All in all, The Maze Runner is good "let's go, see and forget" movie, that fails to deliver something very important or new, but definitely keeps you interested in future installments.

His name is Thomas. That is all he knows. He has been sent via the mysterious "box" into a contained colony of boys called "the glade". Nobody knows why they are there, only that they cannot leave. Around the glade lies the maze where only the fastest and bravest among them, dubbed "maze runners", get to explore in the hopes of finding a way out. Thomas' arrival causes a schism among the boys and strange incidents start happening one after the other. As the perfect peaceful society of the Glade is slowly torn asunder, Thomas must unravel the secrets of the maze and confront the horrors within. Secrets, half-truths, and a sense that all is not what it seems. I have always loved a good sci if mystery. Our premise of a community of male teens isolated from the world is a premise many would be familiar with. The group rivalries, the competition for alpha male status, the unique lifestyle and forms of punishment; MAZE RUNNER takes advantage of its slow moving first half to build that world of lost boys. All the while, the constant mystery of the maze lingers. And just when things start to wind down, the writers throw more surprises into the mix which give the film a much needed sense of urgency. What are these surprises? No spoilers now. But rest assured, this movie has great pacing.MAZE RUNNER is how I always imagined a gritty blockbuster movie would look based on those printed mazes in activity books we used to trace with crayons when we were kids. The maze itself is marvelously designed, oozing with a sense of dread. The ominous walls combines an ancient monolithic look with pieces of worn out future tech peeking out the corners; just enough to give this uneasy sense of that something is not quite right. Couple all that with some truly spine chilling sound effects and the movie starts to cross into horror territory. It is to mazes kind of like what they did to a simple board game called Battleship. Unlike the battleship movie, MAZE RUNNER gives us some well rounded characters with believable motives and decent development. Yes you have some clichéd stereotypes in the benevolent but status quo upholding leader, the hot headed "warrior chief" alpha male edging for a fight, the conflicted second in command, and an adorable sidekick for the main character. Yet it is this sense of familiarity with the character archetypes and the isolated single gender community setting that let's one ease into the story without being alienated by the already alienating premise.Amazing as the movie is, MAZE RUNNER is not without some flaws. Main character Thomas suffers from the typical designated hero syndrome. He is not a kid who earns his heroism or the respect of the group. From the get go, everything important revolves around him, he is able to do startling things that no one else can. You know he is special and the plot does not hide that or let it develop naturally. Director Wes Ball crafts a decently paced narrative with top notch special effects, but the visuals tend to be marred by his obsession with out of focus shaky cameras in action scenes. Perhaps the biggest misstep is some poorly placed flashbacks that could have completely ruined the mystery element for audiences familiar with certain video games (hint: Portal). I admit to not having read the original book so I would not know how close it is to the source material. On its own, MAZE RUNNER is The grandchild of LORD OF THE FLIES and TV's LOST. It combines tried and true story beats sieved through an intriguing premise and a decent mystery (despite being almost undone by the ill advised flashbacks). It avoids many mistakes other adaptations of young adult novels make, like lingering on romance subplots, and leaves a decent sequel hook that leaves you wanting more.

I'm going to start this review out by saying that I walked into this movie no knowledge of the book series, so all I know is what friends of mine told me happens in the book; which I learned after the movie ended. From what I was told, they did leave out certain aspects of the book, and slightly altered the ending, and I believe that these book aspects were unnecessary anyway, as they made a film which told an exciting story anyway, regardless of the story the book told.My criticisms of the movie are that the ending wasn't very original. Knowing nothing of the books, I was surprised because I didn't know that there would be a series out of this, and it wasn't just a stand alone film. This definitely helped me appreciate the ending more than others, but now that I know, I can look back and realize that the set up for the sequel was just awful. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that they could easily have made it more subtle, and it would have improved it quite significantly. My other concern is that it predicable to a certain degree, and when they find out why they are in the maze, it seems like a situation that is being overused these days.Having said all that however, the film did manage to excite me for the sequel, which I didn't even know was going to happen. The CGI was pretty good, there were some iffy moments, but overall I was impressed. The story also managed to remain interesting while setting up for the climax, with incredible action sequences, and one really tough to watch scene about how they deal with a deadly infection. This scene was emotional, and hard to watch, but it brilliantly illustrated how desperate and helpless the boys in the movie are. The films highlight was the acting. There was not a single moment where the acting was bland, which was a nice surprise to me, considering the youth in the cast. Kaya Scodelario did have a few moments where you could tell she was struggling to fight her British accent, but her acting was still well done. The three highlights of the cast were Dylan O'Brien, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, and Will Poulter especially, who was fantastic. These three actors more than anyone were great in every scene they were in.Overall, I give The Maze Runner an 8/10, because the story, effects, and acting were great, while the ending could have been better

I watched this movies last night.I found the movies had a great story line and we'll played via the main cast and crew.Special mention to Dylan O'Brien for his expressions in act during the movie and Thomas Brodie-Sangster for his roll as the mature decision maker.The movie is exciting and absorbs you in the chase.However I did not find the robots logically could jump to the vines with such design without gravity setting in, but somehow make it.I like how the living arrangement is the actual center of the maze with a little bit of a kill run made the result worth while.I like how it was not a love story of man and women such get boring and repetitive, chicks in would generally not survive these types of circumstances.Such is a great series to come and look forward in the future games to come.

I've never read the book, but I saw considerable praise for this movie. When my friend and I decided to see this movie, I had decent expectations for it. I expected a well made movie with a fair amount of thrills and action. Not only did I get that, but a lot more than I bargained for. This is a very well made movie that has solid storytelling and lots of intense action. The action scenes are filled with tension, building the suspense very efficiently. There are some fantastic chase scenes that had me on the edge of my seat especially the one involving Tomas and a Griever. I was blown away by the performances in this movie! Considering I had only seen a couple of the actors in other things. Dylan O'Brien is excellent as our hero, Thomas. I've never seen Teen Wolf, but he was great here. Kaya Scodelario is really good as well and played off O'Brien very well. The rest of the cast is just as good. Even Patricia Clarkson has a brief role at the end. The only minor complaint I had is that it was rather simple to figure out where this was heading. I picked up on it pretty quickly, but I still enjoyed the ride. The ending was quite satisfactory, filled with emotion and suspense, setting up the sequel nicely. This is the best movie I've seen in theaters this year. Even if you aren't familiar with the book, you can still have a great time. I don't see how you can possibly dislike this movie, but that's just me. It's well worth the money to see it in theaters. 8.3/10

To start, I am a member of the target audience (although I hope an objective one). I read The Maze Runner a few years before the movie came out, and then re-read it in January when I heard about the big-screen adaption. This formula has gotten pretty standard to me, having gone through the same ordeal with The Golden Compass, Eragon, Percy Jackson, and The Hunger Games. As a book-reader, I have learned to be disappointed with movies (as only those who had to sit through the horrors of Eragon would know).Frankly, The Maze Runner is probably my least favorite book of the lot. Not that I dislike it; I'm just well aware of its faults - mostly lying within an illogical narrative. So, needless to say, after I entered the movie theater, I was prepared for a flop.I did not get one.I knew the movie did not have a very large budget, and since the young director, Wes Ball, came from a CGI background, I was worried that all of the money would be spent on such things, leaving little for the acting. It turns out they didn't need to spend anything on actors, as the cast did an exceptional job. Brodie-Sangster as 'Newt' did exceptional work, and I look forward to seeing him play a role in future sequels. Maybe Ball's young age helped him connect with young actors.What Ball really managed to do well was eliminate most of the unnecessary aspects of the book, only keeping those plot points that are relevant to the upcoming sequels. Obviously, the core premise of the book stayed, but many minor details were changed in a good way. Almost every change he made makes sense to me, and the movie had a much better flow than the book did.If I had to complain about Ball's directing decisions, a few points come to mind. The first is that the movie suffered from the same issue as the book, that is, a poor conclusion. It comes abruptly and bluntly, and is almost entirely exposition for the next film. I can think of many ways Ball could have changed the book ending and still kept the series alive, but I think he didn't want to stray too far from the book when it comes to setting up sequels. It's a safe play, but not the right one.The other issue is the downgraded roll of Teresa (the girl that is sent to the maze). I understand why certain details of her character were removed for the movie adaption, but what was left over is essentially a token girl character. And for a movie that seems so worried about setting up its sequel, not developing this specific character could be troublesome.Speaking of sequels, I personally didn't find them as enthralling as the original in the series, i.e. The Maze Runner; so I hope going forward that Ball isn't afraid to deviate from the novels and flesh out some of the narrative a bit better than James Dashner (original author) did.I would argue that this is a better movie than The Hunger Games - which suffered more from the original director, and it does more than enough to satisfy readers of the book. Hopefully its sequel does as much for the series as Catching Fire did for its.When the movie is over, you're left with an impressive show of acting, strong action scenes, and hopes for a titillating sequel. Hopefully those sequels are worth the poor ending in this movie.

There are many works this adaptation can be compared to. The first one to pop up in my mind while watching this at the theater was The Lord of the Flies by William Golding. The all male group trying to survive on their own made me go back to the grandiose classic book. There is also The Hunger Games and Divergent both of them being adaptation of books like this movie The Maze Runner. However, the bigger comparison can be made in the idea of teenagers attempting to save a world that is corrupt and destroyed. In my opinion, each movie I listed above is original in its own way and The Maze Runner is here to compete with them. The idea is not new but the way the idea is conveyed in the movie is authentic. You feel every bit of action like you're there while watching this movie. The acting is also undeniable great. Hollywood definitely hit the spot with these entertaining sci-fi movies. So this movie is definitely a yes from me.

Belongs in the same category as Hunger Games but instead of a bad ass young girl, it's a dude who leads an all boys club, which may explain the large amount of violence the movie had, and may also explain why I liked it.There was a lot of action and aggression in the movie. A boy who only knows his name is Thomas is toss into a lord of the flies situation were the answer to his and his fellow young warriors unknown past is to unlock the mystery of the Maze. So they must run it.What's cool about the adventurous journey is that they were able to do it in under two hours. A feet in its own these days. Worth the 113mins

To start, if you're torn between reading the book first or seeing the movie first, read the book. Then go see the movie knowing that it's changed some things around and is an overall lesser experience. If you HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE RIGHT NOW, then give the book a whirl if you don't absolutely hate the movie.If you read the book, you'll probably be a bit disappointed. The more I think about it, the more things I remember were left out. I'd say that overall the movie kept about 55% of the content from the book. A lot of stuff was either compressed or completely cut. A lot of things were changed around too. Characters act and/or look different, some key elements from the plot are shortened or absent, etc. The movie isn't an incoherent, awful mess like Eragon was, but it isn't as faithful an adaption as the Harry Potter movies were. To give some examples without spoiling anything:the relationships between the characters are shadows of what they are in the book, especially Thomas/Theresathe 'rules' of the Maze are different and thus key events unfold differentlythe whole story moves much quicker and things happen pretty fast. It's very action-driven and things sort of happen to the characters rather than them figuring things out. I also think that the movie takes place over a shorter period of time than the book.the whole thing is less violent and dark, probably to appeal to the tween girls that cling to leading man Dylan O'Brien's anklesBut as I said, not a disaster. Visually, the movie looks pretty decent. The CGI isn't bad and the sets for the Glade, Maze, etc were cool. The acting was all on point, especially Dylan O'Brien and whoever did Chuck and Newt. I remember seeing the Newt dude in Doctor Who a while back. Hopefully they move on to bigger and better things, especially Dylan. the dude's the one bright spot in Teen Wolf and he was also the person who brought this movie up from a 4/10 to a 5. Guy's a good actor. And yea I'll admit, I went into this movie already a fan of his.ANYWAYI'm a bit torn on how I feel about all the changes made.... on the one hand, it grinds my gears a bit because I feel like the book's version of events is better. On the other hand, it keeps things fresh for people who have already read the book. But you know what, if you go to see a movie based on a book you've read, you aren't going for a new experience. You're going to see the story that you read on paper and acted out in your head played out on the big screen. So in that regard, the movie fails.Go into the theater knowing the experience will be different, and you might not hate it. You might even enjoy it a little bit.But on its own, it's a 'meh' movie, and as an adaption, it doesn't do the best job. So if I had to sum up my feelings about this movie in one sentence, it would be:Not the worst thing ever.How's that for advertising. Stick it on the posters and trailers.THE MAZE RUNNER Not the worst thing ever. - blackbriar246

The Maze Runner, a poorly written mess of a film. While, yes some parts were quite entertaining, the whole story is very predictable. The ending was quite abrupt and half-assed as well but I will continue onto that after I address moments which happened earlier in the movie. First, the whole concept is quite interesting, although the writers did not expand on it properly, leaving the whole movie to be rushed and unenjoyable. The Maze Runner is a few young, up- and-coming male actors, a plot that does not live up to the original and way too many cliché moments. Watch, as everyone in the audience pretends not to predict scenes like: Chuck risking his life for Thomas, Thomas bursting out into tears over a child he has known for 5 days, Thomas running into the maze just for the lols, Gally showing up at the end for no apparent reason even though it was almost impossible to follow the group out of the maze etc. etc. The ending, as stated before, is half-assed, abrupt and completely rushed. Half of the events were unexplained, and when they were the explanation was just plain boring and predictable. Plus at the very end it hints towards a second movie, god help us. I could go on and on about this movie, but the fact is it is one of those movies you watch, like, think about then realize how poorly written it actually was. Spare yourself the 113 minutes and just watch the Hunger Games: Catching Fire.

‎Wes Ball‬'s first big direction venture couldn't be ignored. Albeit ‪Dashner‬ hands him over his brilliant tale on a silver platter, Wes still makes it appear equally great.Dashner's story is a reflection of our real world. It makes you ponder, if we too are a part of something inexplicable, that our life is a maze and we are just surviving. Are we also pawns of someone's experiment? Are we supposed to search for a door? Our lives have inevitable elements like ‪‎Gally‬, like a religious preacher who stops people from going out or finding a door, forcing you to stay in the labyrinth, following rules that conventions made! And like ‪Alby‬ who was the oldest who created them for mere extant! ‪‎Will Poulter‬ was brilliant as Gally and ‪Dylan‬ worked really hard to get into Thomas' shoes! His acting is developing. The movie packs in surprises as it climaxes which were subtly portrayed.The screenplay hasn't much to offer, visual effects are fine. There are some flaws that can be ignored for the amazing concept. Pointing some - The deadly ‪Grievers‬ becoming suddenly less fatal when sticks were poked at them, the clichéd bit of Chuck's fate, the knock that brought Thomas' name back, a gal ‪Teresa‬ who has to be there even though she didn't have a purpose, questions like why couldn't they make a ladder Maze-tall in three frigging years? At least they could have seen where they were at, or if the walls were concrete and they had weapons couldn't they create fractures in the wall and try to climb?Overlooking every such minute bits it was overall a great movie on its way to become an even greater franchise!

I for one came into the movie already having read the book, so naturally my expectations were rather high and i have to say despite some small unnecessary changes to the original story ,which of course i expected, it did not disappoint. The casting was pretty near perfect and Dylan O'Brian gave an outstanding performance. The actor who played chuck was the only one who fell a little flat for me and didn't quite connect the way he should have, other wise it was a very well casted movie. The visuals were phenomenal and ,I'm sure, met the expectations for anyone who imagined the maze ,as i did, while reading the book. Even if you haven read the book i would highly suggest this movie, it truly breaks off from that whole "young adult novel" theme and really conveys some deeper concepts such as freedom vs security and a very "lord of the flies" take on how society forms among a large group of young boys.I would HIGHLY recommend ,if you can, seeing this movie in a Cinemax theater with Barco's new three screen projection system, its only available in five theaters in America and "The Maze Runner" is the first movie to be commercially seen through this format. It's honestly one of the most visually stunning concepts I've seen used in a film since "Avatar". The three screen panoramic style make you feel like you are in the maze with the characters and is especially effective in the opening scene, truly no other movie would have suited this style better than "The Maze Runner". Seen With the Barco experience i would rate this movie 10/10 purely for just how immersive the whole experience was and how well it fit into the working of this story. This new system and the compelling twists of the movie will make your heart beat right out of your chest and i hope to see this technology used in several more movie in the future. Basically GO SEE THIS MOVIE

I recently re-watched the first film and was surprised at how robust its shelf life is. Again, it is undeniably cheesy and jingoistic, but done suitably well, I can have a ball with any material. In "Independence Day: Resurgence", set and finally released 20 years after the events of the first film, the aliens get medieval on us with an even bigger mothership.There's a lot of heroics here by many a character who do their equal part to stop this new alien menace, having already made a stuffed calzone of the Earth's crust comprising from London all the way to Singapore. There's also a refreshingly silly undertone which sets it apart from the grim and serious blockbusters of today, and with added Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch who return as the Levinsons, and "Star Trek" alumnus Brent Spiner as the eccentric Dr. Okun, Emmerich and his co-writers, including returning scribe Dean Devlin, certainly did not skimp out on the comic silliness.Unfortunately, that is where the similarities end. The sins of sequelitis has been bestowed upon this sequel to his 1996 smash hit, and Emmerich is to blame, either for his laziness to phone it in out of frustration to fulfill the fans; or bucking in to studio demand to condense the film into a mere 2 hours. Sure, lots of things happen in the film, including stuff and cities going kablooey in high style, and high-tech aerial dogfights to give "Star Wars" a run for its money. Even Liam Hemsworth as the new hero Jake Morrison did not annoy me as much as I expected, though Hemsworth is still a far cry from Will Smith's "Elvis has left the building!" persona.However, as slick as the modern CGI is, giving a sleeker look to the tech shown in the original film, it never quite gels together as a cohesive film - no momentum, no suspense, no catharsis when it does end. Bill Pullman's returning ex-President Thomas Whitmore is utterly wasted, as per his daughter Patricia (Maika Monroe, not doing her rep from "It Follows" any favours). It is not their fault; I feel that there is a lot of footage Emmerich was forced to excise by the Fox bigwigs to get more butts into cinema seats. Perhaps an extra half- hour of more cataclysmic destruction and character motives, but I may be asking for a bit too much at this point.Things are very rushed indeed, with no payoff even when there's lots of characters doing their fair share to save the day. Goldblum and Hirsch, however, are still naturals, and they steal every scene they're in, and lift the movie up from near tediousness. Nevertheless, the special effects are fantastic, and are most certainly worth the price of admission alone.It's kind of sad. This new one promotes global equality, with a female U.S. President (Sela Ward) celebrating world peace, and with everyone from across the globe giving it their all to kick E.T.'s ass. The action is fine and dandy without any of those annoying shaky-cam and quick-cut edits. And yet, the film suffers from awkward pacing, rushed dynamics, and especially a lack of cities exploding into fireballs. It even has sequel-teasing in the laziest manner possible in its final moments.To quote Marvin the Martian, "Where's the kaboom? There's supposed to be an Earth-Shattering Kaboom!"

How stupid do the script writers think the viewing audience is?If the movie were made for four year olds, it would be an insult to their intelligence....Great first 10 minutes or so then we are expected to leave logic and believability behind...Making no sense doesn't seem to bother the director and producers...The sphere can set up a planet to teach all other civilizations how to defend against the bad aliens...and it's credentials for doing so? Their planet got wiped out by said aliens and even the lower intelligence earthlings, using replicated, imitated weapons ripped from the bad aliens can shoot it down over the moon...yeah...great teachers they'll be...The Queen can survive a fusion bomb blast but her shield falls under minor weapon fires...The Queen can control all the alien ships but yeah, let the two hero's craft shoot at her for fun before taking over control...And having all her fighters surround her...I guess to offer her protection...but they just kept flying round and round like an amusement park ride when the two rogue fighters decide to attack her...An ex president's daughter who no longer flies can just commandeer a fighter...to fly alongside her father, who couldn't walk properly in the beginning of the film but can still fly a new age jet...all the air forces around the world obviously overdoing their pilot screening a tad...The list goes on and on...I can't be bothered to write them all down or I might be writing an entire new script or story line...I want my time and money back...as well as compensation for ruining my fond memory of the first film...

Just seen this and was looking forward to it. It was big and dumb, but a bit of fun. Check in your brain at the door.Everything is grander than last time, though it's also sillier and much more absurd; but what else is to be expected? No shortage of cheese, corniness, plot holes and continuity errors, but if you know what you're in for you shouldn't be disappointed.Gotta say, I wasn't disappointed by any stretch and enjoyed it, but it doesn't improve on the original and is very, very cluttered. 7/10. Worth checking out if you don't take either your movies or yourself too seriously. Enjoy.

Just back from seeing this premier at my local Vue cinema, and it has left me with a glow that one gets from seeing an awesome movie, something which no movie has given me in a long long time.As specified in the title, it played out a bit like a Star Trek movie. I thought I had gone in to see the wrong movie until Jeff Goldblum showed up.It was nowhere near as classic as the original, many of the scenes and speeches given actually being rip offs from the first movie. I started chuckling at the part where President Whitmore got assaulted by the alien. It's something we've seen before why do it again?A bit of a plot hole that I find unforgivable is that in the first movie President Whitmore specifically stated "They are entire civilisation, moving fom planet to planet." We destroyed that 'entire civilisation' in 1996 so how can the same aliens return?The CGI was pretty rubbish too. I reckon a lot of the reason I enjoyed this movie was due to the fact I saw it in 3D, something which I have not seen the original in. I was reviewing it as I watched it and I was going to give it 5/10 had it not been for the tear jerking ending.

"Independence Day" is 1996's prime summer blockbuster. Despite being an unoriginal piece of space invasion sci-fi, it has its fun moments like the alien destruction, quirky characters and Will Smith's star-making performance. Now, after 20 years in the waiting, the aliens "resurge" for one more attack in their bigger return in the lamest way possible.As a starter, after the events of the 1996 hit maker, the whole world is unified under one protection umbrella called Earth Space Defense. A weary but game Jeff Goldblum returns as himself, again, who uncovers a plan about the aliens sending a distress signal after their defeat. Goldblum tries his best but he is given the same material from the original, and he just dragged Charlotte Gainsbourg along in his chase. And once invasion is confirmed, it is up to the ragtag team of pilots, like Liam Hemsworth, Jessie Usher as Will Smith's son, and Maika Monroe as Bill Pullman's daughter, and Roland Emmerich's stock characters to stop the invading forces.For the audience, try doing an endurance test (in the first 10 minutes) because you will likely have a hard time getting invested on anything. Blame it on the fast but uneven pacing that questions the editing, introduces new characters inserted to no effect (What are Hemsworth and Usher fighting about again?), inserts pointless characters (case in point, Judd Hirsch's unpleasant return) and kills off old characters to no payoff. Not helping is the jarring script (penned by five writers, including Emmerich, partner Dean Devlin and James Vanderbilt of The Amazing Spider-Man) that rehashes the pattern of the original. Wait what?The only saving grace is the alien destruction that made the original kind of remarkable. But even that, it basically lasts only for a while and the climax copies Ivan Reitman's "Evolution". Lame. Yet at least you will tolerate returnees being present for nostalgia factor (from Bill Pullman's awesome president in old man's beard and Brent Spiner's wacky scientist) and Maika Monroe's phoned-in yet bearable performance. But even they cannot save "Independence Day: Resurgence" for being a total trainwreck of a sequel that failed to capture the fun, the charm, the flair, the bombast, the scale and the awesomeness of the original. 2016 sequel-itis hit once again, and "Resurgence" is not immune.It is just a summer popcorn lackluster.

It is the same repetitive event from that in 1996 but comes in a larger scale and spectacular improvement in visual effects. This is definitely a sequel to Independence Day as the effort to remain the ridiculous science, cheesy but hilarious dialogues, patriotism and unity to defense the world against aliens invasion; of all its many flaws, that's the type of fun that triggers part but not entirely, the classic entertainment values of its predecessor. Although the absence of Will Smith and introduction of new young characters seems a bit less convincing due to the formulaic plot and thin character development, the film reunites a number of casts from 20 years ago, including Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Brent Spiner who still deliver to further enhance the enjoyment of this popcorn flick. The scores, composed by both Harald Kloser/ Thomas Wander seems to be better than their previous works and follows Zimmer's style to be loud while the stunning visual effects are nothing less than those in "The Day After Tomorrow" and "2012" which would definitely attract audiences who enjoy to catch the moments of blowing stuffs up. Emmerich might not be a great writer but once again he is still able to prove that he is the only king of making wild disaster porn that destruct the whole Earth beautifully.

Independence Day: Resurgence is the sequel to the 1996 blockbuster Independence Day. The original movie was a dumb, cheesy action film with great special effects for the time. Despite its shortcomings, it was a guilty pleasure to me. However, the same cannot be said about the sequel. It is a dull, badly-paced bore with poorly executed clever ideas.Twenty years after the events of the original film, human beings have salvaged the technology of the downed alien spacecraft and have used it to live in peace with each other. However, just before their defeat, the aliens were able to send a distress call to the rest of their fleet in outer space. After receiving the call, the aliens send out an ever larger and more powerful fleet towards Earth to once again threaten the existence of humanity.While the original film at least had some admirable practical effects and fun moments, this film was overloaded with bland CGI and surprisingly boring scenes that went nowhere. I felt no emotional attachment to any of the characters, who just felt like one- dimensional cardboard cutouts. Although, I did enjoy some of the ideas that the film employed about humanity adopting the alien technology as their own, this was just briefly glanced over and barely referenced throughout the plot. Overall, I can only really recommend this film to hardcore fans of the original, but even that is pushing it. I rate it a mediocre 5/10.

Independence Day was one of my favourite movies growing up, so I admit I was somewhat excited for this when it was first announced. Goldblum was on board, so was Pullman, Hirsch, Spiner (he survived?? OK...) and Emmerich was directing again. It sounded like a nostalgia trip for people like me who grew up with the movie. No Will Smith, but you can't have everything, right? The first trailer came out a few months ago and I was a little less excited. So I lowered my expectations and still planned on going to see it. Maybe it would still bring back some of that childhood excitement I had when I saw the first one for the very first time, because let's face it, you don't go into a movie like this expecting Schindler's List. Well, ID: Resurgence proves that sometimes you gotta be careful what you wish for. It plunges the depths of just how dumb, incoherent, and downright insulting to your intelligence a big blockbuster can get. The CG destruction is so bland and the majority of the acting and dialogue so forced and trite that by the end, I almost felt like I hadn't really watched anything at all. I wanted to walk out halfway through. I wonder how much they gave Jeff Goldblum to cajole him into this garbage. (2 points for Goldblum & Hirsch, and the alien queen at the end was admittedly pretty cool)

This is one of those movies where the grown up audience knows after 5 minutes, that the target group is teenagers. Even in the middle of the movie's major crisis, the whole world pauses, as two young characters have to talk intimately, because it is just so important, for she's hot and he's so cute, so the less important end of our civilization will just have to wait.Unlike many famous sci-fi movies, this movie is not true to science at all. If some young script writer thought that it would be "dope" for gravity to be "defeatable", then gravity is "defeatable", whatever that means. Small objects that are hidden can be monitored in detail by the good guys, while objects the size of a continent are completely undetectable. There are dozens of these examples where the movie makes no sense.The humor in this movie has no finesse. Watching it is like being at dinner with the distant uncle who is not funny but keeps cracking jokes, though no one is really laughing but him.Most of the time, the dialogues sound like a wacky parody, in the way Doc spoke with Martin in Back to the Future. They even copied the Doc character so directly, that there is an actual long haired, wacky old man in a lab coat talking in a nutty way while experimenting with sci-fi technology.One thing does work, though, the computer graphics are impressive. Most of the time, the visual and audio effects really shine. It is just sad that an obviously huge gift budget was spent fully on the wrapping, and very, very little was spent on the gift inside.

"Independence Day: Resurgence" it's certainly not a great film, but it's definitely an "Independence Day" sequel. For all its many flaws, that's kind of fun and nostalgic. Because there's so much going on, often the story line appears rushed. In trying to recapture the sheer entertainment value of the first movie, this sequel makers forgot that it was making a movie for modern audiences, and they kept all the terrible dialogues. The main thing consumers will be looking for from "Resurgence" is entertainment, and that it delivers successfully, but lacks the tension of the original. I don't know why the film was worth making at all, except for the profit of course. nikisreviews.com

TL;DR: It was actually boring. There was a story here that had potential but it was let down by terrible acting, bad dialog, no story or character development at all and, ultimately, no soul to this one. 3 points for above average special effects, -7 for just an awful movie. Netflix this one.Edition watched: 3D IMAXIn 1996's Independence Day, Bill Pullman's speech hit you emotionally somewhere. Even if that emotion was disgust, you had a reaction. All of Will Smith's one liners made you cringe or laugh. No matter how much you may deny it publicly, Randy Quaid's end put a lump in your throat the first time you saw it. There was soul to that movie, even though it was an ensemble cast, characters were developed, the story progressed and there were heroes you cheered for and aliens you despised.None of that was present in 2016's Independence Day. All the new actors were either bad or terrible. I didn't care if the aliens won or lost. Not only were the new actors bad but some of the dialog they were forced to work with was just terrible. Jessie T. Usher's character has a few key lines that are supposed to hearken back to those emotional one liners from Will Smith in 1996, such as: "Welcome to Earth!". Yet Usher delivered those lines in such a deadpan, soulless way that made me wonder if he thought he was supposed to be playing an emotionless android. Then you have my favorite emotionless android actor Brent Spiner, who is someone I know to be a quality actor, yet the dialog and scenes with him were so bad I had to wonder for a second if all his previous work was done by a twin. I could go on, but the acting and dialog were just parts of the problem. There was no character development at all. They simply tried to cram too much into this movie. From the constant pandering to a Mainland Chinese audience (unnecessary scenes that should have been used for any kind of plot or character development) to Vivica A. Fox's minuscule screen time, there was too much shoved into this 120 min movie which ended up making it a big mess that went nowhere. In the end, I formed no attachment to any of the new characters and was detached from old characters that I once cheered for.The most damning thing though is, despite all the explosions and this alien invasion, there was no excitement. I was bored. There was a girl in front of me texting and using FB messenger and I found myself involuntarily lifting my 3D glasses and reading her text chain and messenger thread till I caught myself and put my glasses back on. Her inane chatter about how boring this movie was, her cat, the guy she was sitting next to and so forth were more interesting to me than the movie on the huge IMAX screen was.As a huge fan of alien invasion movies, I walked out feeling like this was such a huge opportunity wasted. If you told me the basic story of this move yesterday, I would've been ecstatic to see a trilogy. Now I hope the 3rd one dies in production and they put the money to a Battle Los Angeles 2.

I went to a Independence Day double bill and to watch the first film in the cinema after i was too young to watch the first time. I was surprised that it still holds up to some films today bar a couple of scenes. When I first heard that they were releasing a sequel at first i was a really excited a re match. I thought yes some great popcorn action. But getting closer to the release date and hearing Will Smith pulled out and not being previewed to critics before hand made me more sceptical. I went in with low expectations.This film did not even make those low expectations. Jeff Goldblum tries to be the comic relief but it doesn't have the same charisma and screen presence of Will Smith and it comes out quite cringy. And by bringing back some of the old many minor characters wasn't needed. Like the old guy with long hair who worked at area 51 and Jeff Goldblum Dad.The film like in real time takes place 20 years after the original and we have used their technology to advance ours. This though would properly happen in real life it already for me made this film more of a fantasy then a true to life underdog situation that the first film gave us. We also give us another alien in a shape of a giant sphere which to me seems to give us the upper hand before the aliens even arrived. So I knew we were going to kick there arse.The special effects are great in places and Roland Emmerich doesn't destroy the white house but tease too. They even tease a 3rd film at the end at which i won't be watchingI'm just glad i got to watch the original it all it glory

I happen to remember that the first movie is super awesome. I watched it when I was still in elementary school. But watching this one is only like a 2 hours torture. Thankfully there is Chris Hemsworth who can still give a little sweetness for my sore eyes. Because the rest of the casts are doing a very poor job (except Jeff Goldblum).The plot is rushed. Most of the time, the conflicts don't even make sense. And a hint for the next sequel about inter-galactic wars?! Come on, dude! Star Trek and Star Wars are coming. Are you sure you want to match with them?Bottomline, if you miss the old movie you may watch this. But let me warn you, don't expect too much...

The first Independence Day is very cheesy and simple but it works and even now can you watch it without cringing too much. Just sit back, enjoy the simple script and simple dialogue. The flow of the film still holds up quite well. The character build up, comedy and slight drama was about rightly balanced in the film too. I doubt the same can be said about its sequel 20 years from now. Although I found the film very watchable and entertaining in places, it certainly was not as cohesive as the first part. It does not feel like you are on a journey of wonder such as the first. In fact there are far too many characters in this film to be able to engage with. The whole part of random kids driving through the US and picking up Goldblum's dad from a boat that survived an insane alien space ship crash seemed strange and unnecessary. Too many he is my dad, is my daughter, is my uncle, my niece and if not related then I want a relationship with him/her situations too. The other problem is that all the characters are constantly teleporting all over the place. Goldblum is on earth, mid Africa, on the moon and Area 51 all without too much travel involved. Pullman is in Maryland, Washington DC and Area 51, again without any travel it seemed. Felt like they were all Lois Lane from Man of Steel. Wherever the action is, we will be there. The feeling of scale by showing different areas of earth (which I think they are trying to achieve) was much better handled in the first film and made sense within the story.The new president turned out to be useless and forgotten about mid way through the film. Very strange. Pullman's self sacrifice here seemed less significant than Quaid's in the first film. Very strange considering who Pullman was supposed to be.There are good bits in the film but they are marred by a lot of unnecessary stuff and probably also too much technology they now have on earth to keep track of or care about. All the stuff on the moon seems meaningless later in the film and forgettable. There are no clever "ah that was that thing we briefly saw at the beginning of the film (which I thought was insignificant but isn't now) helping us out here" bits which good script writers usually include in films these days. Usually these things bridge the gap between beginning and end. The whole thing seemed a bit too dumb probably. Sure ID1 was dumb but it never got this dumb I think.The alien space ship crash was great, but the scale was probably unnecessarily large. Awesome effects and parts of the 4DX theatre experience did however make it feel like you were really flying, the part along the Thames in London in 4DX was stunning. I certainly think 4DX is the future of cinema, more so than 3D. A film such as this proves at least this, if nothing else.I did like the queen alien chase for the most part and it shows that a subtle event can have far more impact than the destruction of half of earth.Would have liked to have seen more of Goldblum and less of the more insignificant characters who do nothing really to push the narrative forward. Charlotte Gainsbourg's character seemed British at the beginning and French at the end. Bizarre. Was this right? The film needed far more subtlety in many places and also more clever things rather than some random sphere thing which explains things in plain English. I doubt I will be rewatching this even 10% of the times I've seen part 1.Finally, why didn't they bring back David Arnold for the score? Part of the reason ID1 works so well is because of the simple but very memorable grand music fitting with the Independence Day title and feeling. The ID1 theme was only used at the very end for some reason. The rest of the score seemed very bland and forgettable. Nothing like the first film.If they do make another ID movie and it's not going to be better than this, it would be a real shame and probably the end of the franchise.

If this sequel had appeared in 1997 or 98, it would have been averagely interesting. But in the past twenty years hence, the audience has had the delight to savor so many other much more superior movies of its genre (which were ironically spawned by the first Independence Day's success) - something which the direction of this movie did not bother to account for, hence we are in for a very badly dated why-bother sci-fi flick. The original was passably good for its time, and this sequel is but almost a poor spoof of itself.Everything from the plot to the mundane cheesy dialogue, un-laughable jokes, and empty characters, and OK-ish CGI  all cookie-cutter mishmash from other passé movies. Situations make no sense, neither do the illogical reaction of the characters, including our supposedly 'super-intelligent' big mother-monster chasing after a school bus for no real reason apart from the fact its there, like a playful kitten after a spot of light on the floor. And of course the 'saviour' alienship with all its bombastic intellect and scientific pizazz comes right up face-on to be blown to smithereens without doing the obvious thing of announcing the altruistic reason for its presence  when apparently it does speak English at that too! Anyway, so so so many nonsensical senseless situations here, don't even bother to care two hoots after a while.None of the characters nor actors have any lasting impression nor charisma  and the two 'romantic' couples . totally plastic with inert chemistry. I can almost hear Jeff Goldblum whispering to Judd Hirsch, "Geez, this movie is just so bad we need to wind-up our exaggerated gestures and jaw-drops to save it!" The original TV Star Trek would be more interesting.

When the first one was released it was ahead of its time, something grand, something new but didn't take it self too seriously, it was a B-grade fun flick. Each character was identifiable. Will Smith was the Face of the movie. This sequel on the other hand, well "not much you can expect when you decide to make a Will Smith movie without Will Smith". It didn't the have soul, didn't feel unique, felt like any other modern day VFX popcorn flick. It had amazing scenes but forgettable. Even though I went in with lowest expectations, I still hoped it would do me wrong. My breakdown below.Acting: 5/10 (Geoff Goldblum is the only one worth admiring).Story: 3/10 (same story as first, no soul in characters or script, dialogue was clichéd).Action/VFX: 10/10 (This aspect you cannot dislike, you are left in awe in some scenes, clean CGI, no crazy fast cuts, and thank god no shaky cam).Theatre Experience: 10/10 (watched it in a Dolby Atmos cinema, George st Sydney, Event Cinemas, great experience, popcorn good, staff good as always in Sydney, comfy big seats).Value for Money: 5/10 ($25 ticket with clichéd dialogue and average acting, VFX just saves it from being utterly disappointed, though my disappointment started with the announcement of "No Will Smith" a year ago").Nostalgia: 1/10 (This was a big disappointment, when making a sequel to a classic 20 years later, you expect some throw back feels, Jurassic World executed this extremely well).Recommendation: skip the Cinema, wait for Blu-Ray copy. You will appreciate it more. But if you really want to watch it go to a Dolby Atmos cinema to give you an immersive experience.Overall rating: 5.6/10 or 6 if I watched it on DVD

I just watched the movie (3D) in Thailand. Honestly, this is the film that I was so looking forward to. And it turns out to be a big disappointment. I feel that the director was trying too hard to connect the first one to the sequel, such that it ended up being super cheesy and pointless. There were so many scenes that made me wonder: what the heck was the director thinking? Why was the mother ship so ridiculously huge while the alien queen was so easy to defeat? What was the fight between the two dudes about? It was just pointless and didn't add well to the overall scheme. I didn't feel connected with any of the characters. I felt the movie was rushing too much. Also, I guess the left-wing director was trying hard to promote a female president in the hope that Hillary will win the election in November 2016...another cheesy attempt. That said, I thought the CGI was good but not good enough to redeem itself from such a poorly written plot.

likes : A lot of people were worried that this film would fail because will smith isn't in this film but I'm glad to say they didn't really need him after all as this film was awesome with some unexpected surprises that throw me for six as i was expecting it.Without giving away to much the only thing i can say is earth is no alone in this fight against the aliens, this is what throw me for six as i was not expecting this to happen , the trailer cleverly hide it from the trailer which is a good thing because it made the film so much better & more interesting. I seriously can't wait for the third film, your understand what i mean when you watch this film.All I've seen is miserable people review this film given it poor review i think these people are a waste of space just like the Hollywood critics always putting a film down, seriously do not listen to this people this film is fantastic & worth checking out.The film story its self is similar to the first film only this time it the hive queen omg the ship is almost 3rd's of the earth in size with a massive feet of fighters , the C.G.I is brilliant done special the design of the queen. Incredible work on the design of her show a much large alien size queen sign i feel they have take inspiration from the aliens film queen is design , special the new ship which look like a armada feet, with the unlike Allie this film is brilliantly done for a sequel.Liam Hemsworth & Jessie T. Usher play the heroic guys in the film done a brilliant job at it as well, although Liam had a funny moment that i did laugh at not quite as funny as the first film with will smith & Jeff Goldblum moment but still funny. Bill Pullman returning as the ex president done a pretty good job as well show that his flying day weren't past him with his character, Brent Spiner return still play the nutty scientist , Deobia Oparei was a bad ass with his character no fear true warrior character playing a son war lord who fought against the aliens the first time.Angelababy played a pretty bad ass fighter pilot for the Chinese feet , great performance. Jeff Goldblum performance is brilliant as always returning as David Levinson who is now a advisory for the earth defence, he got a bit more action in this film which was good to see , Maika Monroe played the president daughter pretty well you will remember from the first film she was younger little girl now grow up for this film, Maika played this role perfect.What i special love is the story twist that branch this film to a third film which looks to be a great concept , hopeful we wont have to wait for another 20 years to see a 3rd film come out because this was just outstanding for a sequel. Brilliant continuity with the first film showing 20 years later, although it taken 20 years for this sequel to happen, it just a brilliant film.The combat scene are awesome specially with the queen & Ariel combat scenes are brilliant done , although this film was good there were a few moment it didn't have the same impact as the first film but still one hell of a awesome film.Dislikes : One thing that did kind of fall flat was the inspirational speech's in this film well one of them anyway from the character Dylan Hiller it didn't quite have the impact inspirational speech that President Whitmore done to get you pumped for the fight to get you to say come on , bring on type of way which was a same, but i think that was a script writer fault here. This is the only problem i really saw in the film.

I just watched IDR at my local, and I really wanted to like it, but I just can't.The jokes in IDR are lame, telegraphed and few and far between, nowhere near as funny as ID4. The older actors try, but are let down by useless scripts and wooden younger actors. Judd Hirsch is totally wasted. No one's character is developed enough to be worth caring about. I also wanted more development into the post-96 society, esp the children who lived thru that war and are now about to fight this one - how do they feel? Are they traumatised and broken? Are they cocky and ready for the fight? Do they trust the older generation who got them into this? Are they brainwashed by twenty years of preparations? How do they cope when the aliens show up again? When the first wave (ie all their friends and classmates!) is essentially wiped out? There is practically no emotion shown by any of these characters at all, let alone any hints into what the rest of the world is thinking. (Oh, one line by Levinson, but he doesn't seem that upset about it either.) The music just sucked. There seems to be a trend lately of cutting scenes as tightly as possible, snipping out the last second or two. This throws off the rhythm of the scene, the 'beat' needed for the implications to sink in and the jokes to land isn't there anymore, which destroys the whole point. The aerial fight scenes looked lame - I was expecting the new hybrid planes to be much more maneuverable, not just jets with a shinier chassis. The alien fighters were changed, so you can't make a good comparison either. (Which also begs the question, why were the alien fighters different?) The meddling of studio execs and PC-ness (or PG-ness, ha) and pandering to China was palpable - I don't mind the Chinese add-ins, God knows Hollywood could use some diversity, and it makes sense in context, but have some subtlety about it, pls. (There's one quick bit I bet got stuck in precisely because it will get pulled in the Chinese edition, tho, props to whoever slipped it in.) The effects are great - everything looked good and was believable. (Except the alien tentacles looked a bit off to me - this is probably the effect of changing from rubber puppets to fully CGI aliens.) But not really much better than the original, or any of its imitators, and I've seen explosions before - gimme something new! I counted at least four missed opportunities for visual jokes/callbacks, and at least two things crucial to the first movie that were left completely out of the second movie. And what the hell was going on with the African ship? Why hint at all that awesome alien hunting and guerrilla war - and then a new culture/nation created around the ship, with hints of dis-unity with the rest of the world - then ignore it for the rest of the movie? But the Queen is awesome, she steals all her scenes, and there is a LGBT relationship (yay!) that makes the conventional couples and love-interests look even more wooden and predictable. (But they never kiss, so I bet that will get altered in non-LGBT-friendly countries too.) So, a swing and a miss. No third one please. Imma watch the original now...

They trailed out many of the cast from the first movie, but without Will Smith it was always going to lack that little sparkle that the first one had. Add to that a succession of pretty much second rate actors to fill some of the gaps, and it because quite an average movie... one particularly poor performance was that of Charlotte Gainsbourg, who was very wooden and monotone and really added very little to the story-line. I really wanted to enjoy this, and had looked forward to it for some time, however the story was very un-inventive - a schoolboy could have adapted the first script into this within 24 hours. I really hope they don't subject us to a third, or if they do that its another 20 years away.

Independence Day: Resurgence is an over the top B movie with a big budget. It nevertheless embraces it's campy nature much like the first did. The absence of Will Smith leaves something to be desired and some of the quips don't quite land in moments. Even though Roland Emmerich has never been an actors director, I definitely recall the first one having much better acting and dialog. There are a few phoned in performances here. One with actor Jeff Goldblum going into "Lost World" territory having to fill the shoes of the absent leading man, this time Will Smith. All this being said I was not board in the movie and if you're willing to suspend logic, then you will find yourself having a good time. The effects are great and on par with the first. I do however miss those models and practical effects a little bit. The movie looks a lot more sleek and darker at times, which works in some parts but looses the look and feel of the first often. All in all, I cant help but feel this was a 90's nostalgia cash grab with some entertaining sequences and effects. It could have been a lot better, but it feels harmless and fun at the same time 5 stars out of ten

This film tells the story of humans fighting against yet another alien attack. Only this time, the aliens are invading more prepared than twenty years before.One is forgiven to suspect the intentions of making a sequel that comes twenty years later, and indeed the quality of it. After watching it, I have to say I am completely blown away by it. The story is simple, easy to understand, which is a plus for a blockbuster. It tells the story with much urgency, as it wastes no time cutting into the chase. The visual effects are spectacular. Seeing those cities being destroyed makes my breathing stop, literally. I was astounded, and even petrified by those scenes because they look so real.The story then tells a heroic effort to save the human species from extinction. It is a gripping story, and I am so touched by the ending. I enjoyed every minute of "Independence Day: Resurgence"; and this is what a blockbuster should be.

Was very much looking forward to this sequel after I saw the trailer. And I wasn't disappointed.This was a two hour long roller-coaster ride. The movie has almost all the actors from the original movie except Will Smith, and the movie was really made in a way that Smith wasn't missed at all, he was mentioned but I didn't felt that there was an empty space. Emotionally it didn't came close to the first movie, it was almost non stop action. Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman were by far the best actors in this flick. The younger generation actors did the job well enough but I already forgot who was who because they didn't stand out ( they were plain ). A great extra was that the movie has shown the aliens more in-depth ( how they live on their space ship, who is the boss, and what power source the ship of this magnitude has ). CGI in the movie was awesome, the new alien ship was bad-ass and the earth's destruction was on a really grand scale. The movie has a cliffhanger happy ending because there will be a 3rd movie. You can consider this one as the Lord of the rings The Two Towers, a great in-between flick.

They made the first film again, with a few more and bigger bangs, unoriginal boring aliens you've seen the like of so many times before and an even more cheesy script than the first movie. Most of the cast just went through the motions, many of the younger ones ought to be seeking other forms of employment. The CGI was epic in scale but not in originality,the story hackneyed and clichéd. OK it's not a film to be taken with any sort of seriousness, but this was just poor.On the opening afternoon there were just 5 of us in a 200 seat theatre - but it was a dull day and I guess most people were out voting in the EU referendum (or working!), but maybe the mediocre press reviews had an effect.They shouldn't bother to resurrect the aliens unless they can bring something a bit more original to the screen. I wish I'd have joined the rest of the family in the screen next door for The Jungle Book rehash, which they said was very good.

"Despite the world-ending scenario, the film lacks that sense of urgency that grows ever- more frustrating as the film gets closer and closer to the grand finale, which in itself never really hits the heights one hopes for after one false start and the preliminary celebrations. It also lacks compassion or solicitude as human after human gets crushed, killed or possessed by aliens, resulting in the film feel tonally misplaced and misguided. I mean, I see the American optimism and can let it pass by, but the upbeat nature throughout just does not sit right. As well as this, the scientific side to the story rarely offers the clarity needed to fully understand the threat (but maybe that is down to never truly engaging with the first film until it was too late?). Nobody can complain that it didn't offer what you expect - I just hoped for more."In a nutshell, the film is what you expect from an Independence Day sequel, if not exactly what you hoped for. Still, I found the new blood/cast to be engaging and better than expected (even though I'm quite a fan of this Hemsworth brother in particular).Check out my full review on my blog and be sure to let me know what you think - http://goo.gl/QmqFvR

Same plot as the first, just bigger monsters, extreme CGI and bad acting... Why does Liam Hemsworth have a career??? Only positive thing in this epic t u r d is Jeff Goldblum. He just rocks!To sum up... Its a disaster and I have never had the urge to consider demanding a refund, until now. This is just pure cash cow, because they know is box office due to the franchise.The thing that is even more terrific is that they cliff hanged it, so if its a financial success, then rest assure, there will be a third... God Help Us. God Help Hollywood.have a nice day!

Independence Day may have been dumb, but at least it had spirit, gusto and charisma. Resurgence, on the other hand, is even dumber, and is one of the dullest, most lifeless films I've ever seen. For a series that at first emphasised all of humanity's relentless will to survive, this sequel is a sad example of Hollywood not putting in the effort just for a quick payday.I was no fan of the first film, but in comparison to the utter mess that is Resurgence, it now looks like the greatest film ever made. Independence Day: Resurgence does not feature one single moment of tension, excitement or awe; its pathetic story is absolutely all over the place from start to finish, and the unacceptably thin and formulaic characters give you no reason whatsoever to care about anything that's happening on screen.I understand completely that this is meant to be a big, dumb action fest, but the main reason why I can't look past the awful story in Resurgence as I did for the first film is simply because it has no heart to it. The first film saved itself and made a moderately engaging watch through its passion and patriotism, always pushing the idea that humanity will always come through in some way or other.Here, on the other hand, there are two awful speeches that attempt to recapture that glory, and then the rest is all a horrific rip-off of Star Wars. Despite having the potential to look at how alien technology has changed the Earth over the last twenty years, Resurgence dumps a likely intriguing story for an ugly special effects extravaganza that we've seen a million times before.The point I want to get across here is that, despite being a big, hulking 90s disaster movie, Independence Day succeeded thanks to its sheer passion and huge heart. That's why most people remember it fondly, and I'm afraid to say that's the reason that Resurgence, a lifeless and unacceptably formulaic cashgrab, is going to feel like an even more crushing disappointment.And there's one final catch. Just as the first film kicked off 90s disaster movies, Resurgence looks like the beginning of a horrific new trend: pandering to Chinese audiences. The Chinese box office is effectively the biggest in the world now, and this film is a clear indication of Hollywood's desire to get in there quickly. I've got no problem with lead Chinese characters, but when we've got product placement for QQ and 酸奶 in one of the most American movies ever, there's a serious problem.Overall, I was horrified at how bad Independence Day: Resurgence is. Its visuals may be detailed and extravagant, but not even that makes it an enjoyable popcorn fest. The film is a painfully lifeless and dull affair, with a story all over the place, and most disappointingly, completely missing the entire spirit of the original movie that so many loved.

I don't know why so many are writing negative review. Is it because you guys standard are very high ? For me the story line is okay. Not very dull. The good thing of this movie is huge improvement of the CGI effect...Sound effect is good. Graphic is good too. It is not easy to make this sequel i believe. So let's enjoy it and appreciate it. Rather than over fussy. Anyway I have nothing much to complain. Worth waiting of this part 2 after so many donkey years has passed. I am looking forward to watch part 3...Hopefully.Oh forgot....Where is Will Smith ?

It's another film I would class as half-decent. Utterly ridiculous, bombastic and jingoistic, but just as good as the first film.It's surprisingly not terrible.We pick up 20 years after the first invasion. Humanity has rebuilt and evolved thanks to the tech left over by the "Harvesters" - as they are now identified - and the world is looking forward to a good ol' knees up in celebration of the historical victory. This is when the proverbial excrement hits the fan.As in the first film, character development is sparse, and our heroes are as bland as they come. We even now have a Madam President, which is nice. She doesn't last long though. Ho hum.Saving the world is Military Hero #1 (white guy) and Military Hero #2 (black guy). Also there's a chick. She's got brains and skills. Obviously. We've also got Brent Spiner returning as the mad scientist in a much bigger & madder role, and Bill Pullman as the former POTUS, now a wee bit insane, but still able to deliver a rousing speech when called for.Jeff Goldblum remains eternally watchable, and has now graduated from "cable repair man" to ESD (Earth Space Defence) Director, but retains some of his wit. Judd Hirsch returns as his father and the Most Jewish Man Ever. Hilarity ensues.I suppose this is my main problem with this film. The "jokes" fall totally flat. They were hardly high-brow in the original, but they at the very least raised a titter. In this they don't. What we're mostly here for is to see the Earth get absolutely smashed the s**t right out of, and boy oh boy does that happen. When the Burj Khalifa smacks right into the London Eye (what? yeah) Goldblum quips a joke. I snorted in derision. This is the funniest line in the movie. Mass death is hilarious to these people.Naturally, due the the humans now having advanced technology, they quickly figure out how to seriously kick some alien ass, and I was a little disappointed at how easily they did. The ending, while very, VERY similar to ID4 is actually pretty good. But dumb. Really, really dumb. The whole movie is. Do not try to make sense of anything that is happening on screen. If you do, you may start to feel your brain dribbling out of your ears.You can consider this review mostly hyperbole, as I was actually looking forward to this film. Truly, it doesn't disappoint. It's dumb as a box of rocks, has awful characterisation and - when thoughtfully considered - is exactly the same film all over again, but it does what it says on the tin. It's better than average and you know what? I had a blast. Lots of people love the original, and I'd imagine most will enjoy this too. I'll no doubt purchase this on Blu Ray when it becomes available because, I kinda love bad films that try really hard, and this is exactly what Independence Day: Resurgence does. With Aplomb.

Independence Day: Resurgence is probably not going to disappoint anyone. The first film wasn't exactly Citizen Kane, and nor is this one - it sets out to be a brainless action movie with tons of explosions and that's exactly what it achieves.That said, it has a lot of the ingredients for a much more interesting film but doesn't seem to know it - the way that alien technology has impacted human life is barely touched upon, there's mention of the effect that the aliens have had on people's minds but it's never expanded upon, and some interesting clues to the invaders' culture are laid out but go completely underdeveloped. Perhaps if the astoundingly pointless sub-plot involved Jeff Goldblum's dad had been dropped then there might have been a bit more time to insert something of substance.If you liked the first then you'll like this. If you like your sci- fi to have a brain then give it miss.

This film is cliché to unreal measures, extremely predictable and illogical (even beyond the concept that we are dealing with aliens) to infuriating points. Characters you may have cared about in the original film become an afterthought. These new and young characters have zero screen presence to make you want to root for them. If you wish to see some epic humans vs. aliens combat; you picked the wrong movie. There is little of that beyond a few gunfights that are brief. The dogfights are a little entertaining, in my opinion, but that was the extent of entertaining action. This film is more of a disaster movie than an action/adventure. Which was another rare positive point that I will give beyond the mountain of negatives; the disaster aspect of the invasion is pretty cool and appealing to the eye, but that only goes so far. Another gripe I had early on was something I spoke on briefly earlier; the location jumps are overwhelming. Every new scene almost has a caption stating where the scene is taking places. Enough location jumps to give Nightcrawler a headache.You have seen this movie before, folks, its name is 'Independence Day'. If you loved the original so much you can not resist missing out on the sequel that has been twenty years removed. Then by all means, give it your best shot. Otherwise, this film is absolutely juvenile in regards to overdone humor, illogical sequences, and non- linear plots as well as intertwining plots resulting in a underwhelming experience. You are not 'Finding Dory', 'Independence Day: Resurgence'.

Independence Day: Resurgence was not as bad as I was expecting but far from being good, too. If I could go back in time, I'd tell myself to see it but only after it came out on RedBox or Netflix. It had a good story that in the hands of another writer might have been quite excellent. But there were too many cooks in the kitchen who spoiled the broth.Grade: C 7.2 out of 10 3 out of 5Plot: 7/10 The overall plot of the movie was okay. If they had given the script to another, more competent writer, it might have been great. As it was, it was only good. Character Development: 6/10 I'm just going to say it. I'm sick and tired of seeing characters made gay just because it's "politically correct." I don't have a problem with people being gay, but I personally am starting to get turned off by the amount I'm seeing it in movies and television programs that should have absolutely nothing to do with personal relations. This is a sci-fi movie. I want to see aliens come down, blow stuff up, and us kick their asses in return. I don't want to know that this certain character has feelings for another certain character--especially if it's two men. I'm sorry I feel this way, but I do. If you want to put a gay character in a movie, put him in a gay romance with another man that I don't have to see. I don't even want to see two women in love in a science fiction movie. I don't need to see any kind of romance in a science fiction movie because it takes away time from the actual science fiction story.Rant over.Directing: 5/10 Roland Emmerich really needs to not be given any more movies. He did great in the 90s but his time has passed. Move on unless you're going to actually make a good movie--which I don't think he's made since the original Independence Day. Casting: 6/10 Seeing the original cast again was good. Seeing the new actors was horrible--except for William Fichtner, who is pretty much just cool in everything he does.Acting: 6/10 Again, acting by original cast was great. Acting by new cast was pitiful.Cinematography: 9/10 The overall look of the movie was good, but they did rely entirely too much on CGI. The aliens were done well, as were their ships.Music: 9/10 Pretty much the same music from the first movie, so I can't complain.Pacing: 10/10 The movie did not drag, which was good. Sets and Costumes: 9/10 Can't really complain about the standard military uniforms everyone wore. Re-watchability: 5/10 I saw the movie just to see it. I'm glad I did because now I can decide if I want to buy it on digital or not. I might not because of the whole icky gay thing (and again, I don't have a problem with it, I just don't want to see it because it's not my thing). I probably won't buy it, but I will be interested in seeing the third movie that they set up but that will probably never come out.Overall, good idea for a movie but too many issues dragged it down for me and made it almost not worth seeing.

...i always enjoyed the original Independence Day. It had about everything a full-blooded teenage boy could want..Jets shooting spaceships, explosions and more explosions....Throw in a star making performance for Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum doing his Jurassic Park thing and Bill Pullman as about the coolest President ever and you had a great popcorn flick that pretty much revived the disaster movie. ID: Resurgence is not quite as good the original... To be honest, it is quite quickly paced, which isn't a bad thing, but stuff happens very quickly.. You don't have the build-up and sense of wonder/dread that the first film delivered. In this one, stuff blows up early and often.The technology in the movie IS pretty neat. I liked seeing what the makers of the film were able to dream up as far as how we would assimilate the alien tech with our own. There is a lot of cool eye candy here. The old guard turn in decent performances, and to be honest the new blood isn't entirely annoying. I do feel like they kinda shoe-horned Brent Spiner in, but Dr. Okun is a fun character, so okay. There is a lot of cheese and a lot of "oh, come on!" moments, but if you just go with it the movie is popcorn fun. And it does end in a nice place that leaves you wanting to see what happens next.This isn't an Oscar winner, but it is good fun.

It has two good CGI scenes, which you can watch at home some months from now. The rest is garbage. The movie was cut in pieces that do not make any sense. But the complete edition is probably not better. It is BORING, and eminently stupid. Characters explain to the audience the basic plot five minutes after exposition time. It is an indictment of what film executives think about people. It is terrible. This movie needs to bomb, it needs to crash, it must be the point where the madness of the vapid blockbuster ends. Watch again any episode of "Game of Thrones" instead. Again, I repeat this point: it is not even fun in a dumb way. It treats you as a very slow person. You can feel the people responsible for this laughing at you. Make it stop. Don't go to the cinema.

Our local movie house showed both tonight. Part 1 was remastered and in 4K, it was just as awesome as I remember, and we were ready to dive right into the sequel. I was 25 in 96, and loved the first film. Part 2 is a total mess. No central theme, terrible acting, and segments that don't go together. I felt no connection to anyone, and by the "middle" of the film, I was rooting for the aliens. I cannot understand why they waited so long for this film and then delivered this mess. Will Smith dodged a bullet by missing this train wreck. What were they thinking? I am dumber for having seen it. Seriously, not one part of this film made any sense at all. My head hurts now. They leave it open for sequels that I hope never come to pass. Avoid at all costs, save yourself!

Just saw it in the theater and it really is bad, as expected, but I was not ready for this crap-fest. Some of the worst written dialogue in recent memory, my god. They kept trying to 1-up the epic speech from the first film, but why?? Why try to 1-up that speech more than once in this one film?!Aside from the horrible writing, at least Goldblum and diet Hemsworth are OK as far as acting goes, and the narrative actually isn't bad. It's a shame the story gets overtaken by the awful lines and their delivery from the other 99% of the cast. EXCELLENT cgi work done on the aliens and the technology though, and even the action sequences. Go see The Shallows instead, or see Finding Dory again.

"Independence Day Resurgence" review by yours trulyMILD spoiler alertSo... I really liked the original. Even today, when I catch it on A&E, AMC or another channel I'm tempted to watch it. I think it's one of those movies that stands the test of time. In a lot of ways, it's one of the best summer block buster movies of all time.Very rarely is the sequel as good as the original, and this is no exception to that rule. However, it's not bad. It just lacks the allure and tension the other original brought to the screen. Of course, the special effects are outstanding and there are some scenes that rival the original.Everyone knows Will Smith is missing from this film. He undoubtedly carried the first one. However, almost everyone else is back except for Randy Quaid who has lost his marbles and the last time he was in the news... his life went to the shitter.The Return characters of Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman do a lot to save this movie from the new cast. Simply put, they suck. There is so little character development to them it almost felt like Starship Troopers at times. While Starship Troopers was intentionally goofy and fed into the mindset... "we aren't even going to try and do some acting or character development" this young cast is just awkward and uncool.The story line is good and it flows pretty well from the original. However, the movie's transitions are pretty poor. At one moment the director tries to make for you feel an emotional attachment to certain characters, and in the blink of an eye you are onto your next battle scene. So, why the story flows and makes sense... there is very little rhythm and attachment to any character in the film. In many ways, it is very thrown together from the editing crew.There are some really good redeeming qualities to the film though... it's relation to the original is good. The cinematography and visual effects are damn good. It's definitely worthy of seeing on the big screen, but only once... I don't think you'll be buying it for Christmas to watch over and over again.That being said, it hints at another sequel and maybe the 3rd time will bring back some of the charm the original had.

Arriving twenty years after its predecessor took the world by storm, this belated sequel is relying heavily on nostalgia and curiosity to drive up enthusiasm levels. Which is fine, unless the resulting movie is a stinker. Thankfully ID:R isn't a flop, although it ain't going to light the world on fire either. There are two broad elements that sit at extreme opposite ends on the satisfaction scale with this follow-up. At the super-positive end are the visuals and the action, at the negative end is, well, everything else. Let's get the bad news out of the way first. The script, written by a team of five, is dreadful; the plot is initially semi-interesting but quickly becomes derivative and predictable, the alt-futuristic universe has zero depth, and the dialogue is truly, truly horrible. The cast – a combination of young (Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jessie T. Usher) and old (Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, William Fichtner) – valiantly attempt to swim upstream against the strong current of poor screen writing, but fail. Brent Spiner is particularly awful as a crazy scientist, a role that should've been cut entirely, however Pullman gets the award for single worst scene for his unintentionally laughable pep talk to a handful of unknown mechanics. Enough about that though, let's move on to the good news. Visually this blockbuster is utterly spectacular, the sheer scale and ambition of what director Roland Emmerich is trying to achieve is breathtaking, ultimately succeeding in one-upping the original in both size and sheer awesomeness. Both the various spacecraft and alien-tech-infused infrastructure are conceptually intriguing, whilst the nasty otherworldly creatures themselves (especially the Queen Harvester) are superbly disgusting in design and execution. Action-wise there's an abundance of frenetic set pieces to stir up excitement – despite a few aerial dogfights being near on incomprehensible – with a jaw dropping sequence in which the 3000-mile wide alien mothership enters Earth, entire countries be damned, worth the price of admission on its own. Not the glorious Resurgence this franchise was seeking, yet the striking imagery and grand-scale action ensures a certain level of ear-destroying and retina-blasting gratification.

No wonder Will Smith didn't return; he must've read the script. IF there ever was one.I cannot recall a film I have seen in five years that I didn't think to myself: "I HATE THIS MOVIE" over and over throughout. And that started approximately five minutes in and all the way to the end.Independence Day: Resurgence was one of the most horribly spliced together movies I think I've ever seen. Scenes just began and abruptly end and then back and forth to the point you have no clue where anyone was or cared who lived or diedincluding all the countless self- sacrifices. And apparently, I'm not alone as probably one billion people die in this film and yet, barely anyone blinks an eye and even continue on with their lazy jokes that never work.The movie takes place in today's time, 20 years after the 1996 attack and believe me, if you didn't know the original took place in 1996, they'll remind you 12 times. The acquired alien technology changed the face of the Earth, but made everyone even dumber than before. Sure enough, the aliens return and supposedly, humans are ready, but not really and things kind of, sort of fall into place to try and combat the returning aliens. (I wrote that sentence all over the place and if you're unfortunate enough to see this, you'll understand why.)Gone was the heart of the original. Vanished were characters with depth. And worst of all, a coherent story was lost someplace – if it ever existed. The only two things that remained were some of the original's characters who didn't even seem to want to be there and the speeches in the most inopportune times with zero meaning or punch.I did laugh out loud at more than a few scenes due to their absurd attempts to make us care and at other times, I flipped off the screen on how continuously angry I got. The movie was so ridiculous at times, I kept expecting Adam Sandler to show up with some of his just as lame jokes and fall-down pranks. But even he and his sordid career are, laughably, above this mess.Not only should this movie be avoided, but it should be pulled from theatres immediately or, at least, come with a warning: If you loved the first one. Go home and watch that. Forget this ever existed.***Final thoughts: "We had twenty years to prepare. So did they" is the movie poster's tagline. I disagree. The real tagline should've been: "We had twenty minutes to both write a script and edit the film. We apologize."

A good twenty years has passed since Will Smith's F18 pilot Steven Hiller and Jeff Goldblum's computer scientist David Levinson entered the alien mothership that blew up the White House and detonated it from within, saving the human race from annihilation and giving the world two decades of peace through its unity against a more fearsome enemy . In that time, a global Earth Space Defense Agency has been set up with outposts on the moon and Saturn, supported by a defense force that counts Steven's son Tom and former President Bill Thomas J. Whitemore's daughter as its pilots. Alien technology has enriched not just our weaponry but our very lives, allowing us to build a high-tech utopia where we can overcome our human limitations such as gravity.As tantalizing as Roland Emmerich's vision of an alternate present may be, few – we suspect – will be in the mood to get re-acquainted with our heroes of yesteryear, notwithstanding that Emmerich have taken pains to bring them back for this long-overdue sequel. Like before, it is alien destruction on a monumental scale that most will likely be eagerly awaiting with bated breath – including Malaysia's Petronas Twin Towers smashing into the London Eye, Dubai's Burg Kalifa 'spearing' London's Tower Bridge and our very own iconic Marina Bay skyline decimated by the marauding species. Never mind that Emmerich suggests our little red dot is a city in China, seeing our landmarks breaking apart on the big screen as they are sucked up into the sky by a 3000-mile wide queen ship is not a kick you get to have every day.Alas this is hardly the first time that Emmerich has plotted worldwide catastrophe – '2012' and 'The Day After Tomorrow' were also his doings – and that probably explains why he seems less keen on destroying the landmarks than on choreographing the aerial and ground battles between man and alien. Leading the charge against the invaders in Smith's place are Liam Hemsworth's maverick pilot Jake Morrison and Jessie T Usher's Dylan Hiller (the son of Smith's character), the two Top Gun wannabes at odds with each other at the start following a training skirmish that almost killed Dylan. Quite frankly, the personal drama goes nowhere, serving only as filler before the pair take to the skies to try and take down the queen right at the heart of the mothership.But what a thrilling spectacle that makes, as swarms of fighter jets and alien spaceships whiz past each other at dizzying speeds in an aerial dogfight that Emmerich pulls off with aplomb. Emmerich has always loved orchestrating spectacle, and despite a brief sojourn into dramatic fare (last year's 'Stonewall' anyone?), he demonstrates here that he has not lost his knack for epic-scaled action sequences that he was known for creating long before Marvel got into the game. The finale that sees Emmerich bring the fight out to the Salt Flats of Nevada (because the Earth Space Defense Agency just happens to be headquartered in Area 51, get it?) too doesn't disappoint, especially in its show of human wit and ingenuity against the might and numbers of the alien contingent.Yet even as it finds Emmerich at his best, 'IDR' also represents Emmerich at his worst. Character work is middling at best, dismal at worst. Goldblum's wry Earth Space Defense director fares best, given the honour of dishing out the occasional sardonic quip that helps the movie as a whole find the right balance between absurd and awesome. Pullman's PTSD-stricken ex-President seems present only for nostalgia's sake, with little to do than to show that he is just as self-sacrificial with or without that presidential title. Usher is no Will Smith (despite trying to echo the latter by selling the iconic line 'Get ready for a close encounter, bitch!') and barely registers. Ditto ex-President Whitmore's grown-up daughter Patricia (Maika Monroe), who serves no purpose but as love interest to Jake, the only memorable figure of the new guard. Not that fans of the original will be impressed; instead, they are more likely to cheer the return of Brent Spiney and John Storey as a pair of gay lovers/ nuclear scientists at Area 51.Despite the assistance of four other co-writers (including his frequent collaborator Dean Devlin), Emmerich's storytelling leaves much to be desired. After a steady build-up in the first half hour, the rest feels like a patchwork that threatens to fall apart due to under-developed plot threads, vague timelines and Deus-ex-Machinas the size of giant Pokeballs (we mean this literally). Because the invasion and the subsequent response feels rushed and somewhat incoherent, one can't quite feel the anticipation before the attack, the great release of tension when it hits, and that sigh of relief when the threat is finally neutralized. The occasional levity does help to gloss over some of the sheer ludicrousness, but Emmerich's failure to get his audience invested in his narrative or his characters means that you won't feel the fist-pumping emotional triumph he is clearly aiming for at the end.And in a sense, 'IDR' is quintessential Emmerich, built on a promise of epic spectacle which it delivers spectacularly but diminished in storytelling and character. It was always unrealistic to expect this sequel to match up to the expectations of its predecessor, not least because the latter was a cultural touchstone by heralding the arrival of the modern-day effects-driven blockbuster. For millennials though, Emmerich has ensured that this sequel works like a blast from the past, reveling in visual excess and embracing its silly cheesy premise with open arms. How much you love this resurgence depends on your appetite for big, loud and dumb fun that you won't remember once you step out of the cinema, which makes for great summer entertainment – but frankly not much more.

First off let me just throw this out here, this movie is a failure. A gigantic stinking pile of failure and if I could get my $20 back for the two tickets I bought I would jump on that.So why does this movie suck? There's really too many reasons but I'll try to lay out a few for you. Yes it's major spoilers but I don't think you'll really mind once you've seen the crapfest that is this movie.Jeff Goldblum is back. Yes! I mean let's be realistic he was one of the better parts of the first movie and the chemistry between him and the other characters was pretty good. Too bad that's non-existent in this movie. You actually don't even see much of Goldblum, all things considered. When you do see him he doesn't really have any time to get you into his character again. Oh, and his wife? She's apparently nowhere to be found, never mentioned and it's joked about that he has other love interests.Vivica A. Fox- Why was she in this movie? She apparently use her stripper money to become a doctor and is killed only a few minutes after we see her.Alien Weapons- They'd be great but they seem utterly useless against the aliens themselves, well except that orb that the aliens(known as harvesters in the movie) are apparently afraid of.The orb- An alien entity that gave up it's physical form long ago to become technology based. It shows up before the harvesters and the earthlings shoot it own in one shot. Apparently the harvesters are terrified of it but it can be shot down in one shot, yet the same gun can't even pierce the harvesters shields. Speaking of which, apparently this orb's planet was destroyed by the aliens and it now has a planet of refugees and has the technology to make weapons to destroy the harvesters. Yet, it got shot down by their technology in one shot....one shot. The harvesters on the other hand destroy these weapons in a split second.We have awesome airplanes using their technology now...too bad they still get their butts kicked. Actually, it seems they get their butts kicked faster than the jets did in the first one. What exactly did the advancements in technology do for Earth again? Chinese girl, friend of the guy from Hunger Games and Will Smith's son- Yes, this is basically what you'll call them because the chemistry between these characters is so bad you don't even care to learn their names. You can't like their characters as they're just dull. In fact, the one guy whining constantly kind of made me want him to get killed when they went in the mothership. You'll like that scene maybe, I mean it's pretty much an escape out a closing door of the ship whilst being chased...where have we seen that before? Judd Hirsch- No yamaka whatsoever in this movie but apparently some higher power is protecting him as he survives a tsunami without a scratch at all.The alien queen- Probably the dumbest part of the entire movie. Survives several cold fusion bombs because of a shield on her chest but it gets taken out by the ex-president's daughter after a few shots from her airplane and then they take her out using two alien fighter jets. But she's like 100 feet tall and uses a giant gun. Seriously, who thought of that crap? These are just some of the plot holes and stupid moments of the movie. I could go on and on but that would take well over 1000 words. It's funny, the 3 people I went with were 3 of the 7 in the theater the day before opening(Thursday). The ending makes it look like there is definitely going to be a 3rd movie but if it bombs as much as I think it will there wont be, at least not for another 20 years and honestly I don't think there should be.View at your own risk, just don't say no one warned you.

With much expectation, I went along with my cousins to see the awaited 2nd sequel of Independence Day. Before the movie itself a sense of the absence of Will Smith haunted in my mind and I wondered How it will be... Some may find the movie a bit lagging at certain areas during the first part and its all fighting each other in the 2nd part. Some characters were brought back from the first movie but it basically fills them with only some of them. They also tried to include certain comic factors too which went out well.The graphics and 3D is way good. You can watch it but don't expect like the first one. If you do so you will be disappointed. Just treat it as a new movie having basic connections...

I haven't seen a big blockbuster movie about the end of the world since - last Tuesday. Complaints were piling up already about the movie "X Men: Apocalypse" being too similar to other recent blockbusters with Earth-destroying machines as the big dilemma. Yet, here we are with another 90s revival, this time with the big alien invasion movie. And aren't we all tired of aliens? There was a chorus of groans when Indiana Jones faced off with aliens in Peru. There was a definite 'thud' sound when they tried to mix Cowboys and Aliens. I know that plans were around for many years to make a sequel of ID4, why not? It made a gazillion dollars and ushered in the over-the-top special effects extravaganza that the team of Devlin and Emmerich capitalized off of for many years afterward. I remember how eager I was to see the movie "2012", only to be bored to tears with schmaltzy scenes of dopey drama that felt like filler between the big effects shots. In contrast, the movie "San Andreas" demonstrated that you can make a big disaster movie that is actually tolerable to watch. I will say that if you are really a huge fan of the original, you may enjoy the nostalgia of re-visiting some of the major characters from the first film. But somehow they aren't as engaging as the first film. The first film had a solid undertone of tension as the impending invasion began from the first scene. This film lacks that similar tension, yet the story here relies on the impending doom of the planet to have us care about, well everybody. One main character missing from the first film is Will Smith. We now understand why he turned down doing this film. It seems that throwing in a large amount of story ideas would make up for a dead-on-arrival retread. "This time the alien ships are even bigger" and "This time Area 51 is a big spaceport" didn't really get me excited. For the most part the screenplay gets too convoluted that it forgets one of the main tenets of a popcorn movie, which is a sense of fun. Instead we must act like we care about the underdog pilot who got in trouble with the other popular pilot (who is the Will Smith replacement and is absolutely bland), and we must care about the fiancé and the daughter in the White House and the Dad on the boat and the blah blah blah. Brent Spiner is perhaps the only engaging character, returning as the goofy scientist who has the most knowledge about alien technology. The one idea I wish they scrapped was that Earth now had Star Wars technology, and we all lived in the future now. It made us less vulnerable to the advanced alien technology, and it turned the entire film into some light fantasy instead of 'our world'. I think of the attention grabbing teaser trailer for ID4 where a NYPD officer forgets to direct traffic, causing an armoured truck to smash, while he gaped at the alien spaceship over the city. This film is just a series of CGI shots of everyone zipping around in their Jetsons flying cars. This isn't 'our world'. I had a hard time caring about most of the new characters, and felt somewhat sorry for how many of the returning characters were marginalised. The one exception is Jeff Goldbum, who has the most screen time and has the best chance of keeping the film lively with his famous wit. Something strange happened when some actors from other disaster movies appeared in this film, it was hard to keep track of what the actor's character is supposed to be in this film as opposed to the other disaster film. Ultimately, even though some of the big effects shots were cool, the supporting elements didn't create solid momentum to make everything connect together cohesively. Perhaps knowing that we would outsmart the aliens again, I wasn't engaged with the big climatic moment. I think why audiences aren't getting excited about end-of-the- world and alien apocalypse films is that after we all survived the big 2012 scare (it turns out that the Mayans were warning us about the film not the year). So now it's 'Been there, done that'. Only some nifty CGI kept me watching. Again, only if you absolutely loved the first film and would be content just to see Jeff Goldblum make some snarky wisecracks again, then you will enjoy yourself. If you are tired of end-of-the-world over-the-top bigger-is-better extravaganzas, then skip this film.

Lets start with the big question - does it live up to its predecessor from 1996? The answer is a resounding No! And there is a very clear reason for this. Whilst the entire cast of the original Independence Day are back for another round of intergalactic warfare, there is one exception - Will Smith. Now Jessie Usher takes his place as a grown up Dylan Dubrow-Hiller and with new additions including Liam Hemsworth and Travis Trope, they collectively failed to bring the humour, arrogance and likability of Will Smith, instead giving us a very dry performance, and making their characters instantly unlikable. The explosions and special affects are a great improvement on the original but this film feels like a cheap Star Warsrip-off. It could have been and should have been, much, much better. This film is eating a pizza without the cheese.

First of all, Resurgence has an AWESOME marketing campaign on its Facebook fan page featuring short video clips explaining what has happened since the War of '96. They show how the world rebuilt itself, reverse-engineered the alien's technology, came together to form the Earth Space Alliance as a way to defend against the aliens for when they came back, and gave a background on the main characters. Yet hardly any of that is actually shown in the movie. You're dropped right into the middle of an already-established alien- technology-driven world with hardly any explanation for how the world has come to be the way it is, and characters who seem to have elaborate backstories, but which are never fully explained. I'll say if I had never seen the marketing videos before I saw the movie, I'd be scratching my head a lot, and would probably be giving the movie at the best a 6/10. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if many of the negative reviewers here have not seen any of this marketing material. If you haven't, go to Independence Day's Facebook page and watch all of their videos. They'll put the movie in a whole new context.As for the action, it's what you'd expect of a typical summer action blockbuster. Compared to the first movie, it has a lot more hand-to-hand combat with the aliens themselves (who I personally think look awesome, and was hoping to see more of), and it gives more background on their species and reveals what one of their original goals was in the first attack. And surprisingly, aside from an even bigger spaceship that causes a lot of mayhem, it's also not a total rehash of the first. While I feel trying to explain how it isn't would be too much of a spoiler, I'll just say it sets up what could be a really interesting third movie.Overall, aside from the lack of a prologue, for a classic movie that was made 20 years ago, it's a pretty decent sequel. I'd watch it again. BTW, speaking of the first movie, DO NOT expect it to compare to Resurgence. The original ID4 was such a ground-breaking and now classic movie that nothing made in its name could ever top it. So if you see Resurgence expecting to see something as good as the original, you will be disappointed. Approach the new one as if you've never seen the first one before.

I had high expectations for this movie. But leaving my cinema theater I was not that satisfied.I really can't believe how uninteresting the actors were in their characters & their poor acting.You just didn't care about any of them. So the main big advantage of ID2 was its spectacular special effects & kick ass action scenes, but even on this field I was expecting more to be honest.ID2 was good enough solid blockbuster movie but not really great unfortunately.Its definitely not terrible movie or that bad as how many other people have expressed here,but I can see why they feel such disappointed.I was expecting a much better movie from Roland Emmerich.

Look people hype the original up to be the 2nd coming of star wars and in some ways yeah it kinda was (at least better than the terrible prequels)Fastforward 20 years later and...Basically its the same movie just bigger better and just as retarded/stupid and FUN as the original.I loved the original don't get me wrong and this has all the same ingredienants but its missing will smith, the main characters while okay just cant make up for the classic 90's woll smoth.Straya and Generic Chinese insert cant quite hold the attention of the audience or my brain.Moving on the visuals are STUNNING i made the happy accident of seeing this in 3D and its gorgeous there's nothing wrong visually with the movie its 10/10 -3/10 for Generic lead(s) and the sidekicks barely make up for it.It could have been a lot worse so i am glad they had enough sense to make this a decent sequelAll i can say is next time their going GALATIC ;) so this isn't the last we've seen of Independence Day+Visuals +Sense of Humor +Fun +Jeff Goldblum +President +Original cast sans will smith +Replacement Cast is okay, just. +1990's feels and great sequel -No Will Smith (but at least we don't have to put up with his children yay) -Sillyness that doesn't quite translate well but hay its Independence Day not a normal serious movie -Needed a better protagonist or an actor with more character.

Day After Tomorrow, Godzilla (1998), 2012 (horrid, horrid and horrid)--I consider this the second best film from the above mentioned director-- The best IMO being Independence Day. Back to this new film--Second best I've seen this summer, the first being Captain America Civil War. Lighter in atmosphere and funnier compared to the horrendous Batman V. Superman. Lots of battles.The aliens were as vicious as they were ugly this time around. More Dr. Okun. I missed Will Smith but the 5 young characters together made up for his absence after 20 minutes in. No Michael Bay's treatment of women--Hot and unnecessary.Major Downsides: the length. I didn't fall asleep due to wanting to see Dr. Okun and the special effects but a couple of times I was tempted. Frankly I got bored with the love scenes.I will go see it again.

It has taken Roland Emmerich 20 years to get a sequel to Independence Day made. In this time he has had some flops and some big hits. I think he may have made this, definitely his poorest offering yet, so that no matter what he makes next will be classed as brilliant in comparison.The film is a comic book of a film, and in my summary I said that it is like a poor man's version of Battleship. I am not saying that Battleship is good, but its at least enjoyable, something which independence day 2 never reaches.In the original movie, which was made with a much smaller budget than this overblown mess, the effects seemed spectacular. This was down to the fact that at the time, there was still a large use of practical effects. Unfortunately this time round, there is an overuse of CGI. Some of it is admittedly excellent, but it is so lifeless, it just drains the film of any feeling.Also the film was set in a real world environment, which was unprepared for an alien invasion. When it happened the characters had to fight them with real world weapons like fighter jets. In the sequel we have space ships with warp drives and laser guns, with space stations on the moon another unlikely addition. There is absolutely nothing in the film that you can relate to.It is good to see Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Judd Hirsch back from the original, but other than Goldblum, they are pretty much wasted. Luckily the actors are good to overcome their underwritten parts and Hirsch injects the film with some humour. When Judd Hirsch is one of the best things in action movie, you have to ask yourself whats going on? The new leads are unfortunately pretty poor. Its not really the actors fault, as they cant really do much with what they are given. The supporting cast are also wasted, with William Fichtner being totally underused.On the directing side, Emmerich just overloads the screen with a ton of effects and hopes it covers up for the total lack of imagination which he showed in the original. I have read that he is looking to make a sequel to Stargate next. I hope that the failure of this movie stops that from happening, as I actually think that is his best film.

I love the original movie. It is by far one of my favorite 90s movies, and I was very excited to hear that a second installment would premiere this summer. That being said I wouldn't call Independence Day 2 to be a bad movie or the best movie of the summer. What I will say this is was very entertaining and I enjoyed it very much, but there are things that needed to be worked on, such as a few plots holes and logic of the story line. Granted I see potential for a third film and the new direction this story is going. For me this movie made me laugh, got me excited for what happened next, and the special effects were awesome. I know some viewers criticized the scientific logic behind this movie, such as the space ship's mass and how it created it's own gravity to destroy London, but this is a sci fi movie not everything is going to be logical. Bottom line I found it entertaining and fun and to me that's all that matters.

Surprise, it's not that bad! Seriously it's good.. If you have a sense of humor and you're willing to watch this not fully immersed in it but still enjoying it for entertainment purposes, it's a great movie. If you're thinking you want to see a movie that is serious like the original Alien movie, no, this is nothing like that.Think of this as simply the first independence day movie redone but with the volume turned up to 11. The basic premise is basically, lets take what we did the first time around, and do it bigger, crazier, and even more cornball than the first. Lets trot out every movie trope known to mankind in a single film. Yes every single one of them is in this movie. It is in fact a long sequence of overused cliche's, and yes I believe the filmmakers knew that, and yes I believe it was intentional.This is like a dead pan version of tropic thunder. This was like actually fun to watch just to see the various cliche's employed.I could be wrong but I think EVERY SINGLE SCENE IS A TIRED Cliché.And that was actually interesting. People are saying it's not original but I have never seen an alien as tall as a skyscraper chase around a school bus. (Awesome scene) This is where Hollywood needs to go more often. This is both a salute and a slap in the face to its predecessors. The first movie was still taking itself seriously and a little cornball but this one frequently deadpans 'yes this is a joke' without flinching. At one point I asked myself "Why does the Alien hate the school bus so much??" Answer: BECAUSE IT CAN.This is entertainment at a higher level than I'm used to. What else is there to do?In an industry that can't stop copying itself and can't seem to do 'serious' without being trite, just embrace their general failure and roll with them in this new self-aware comedy dressed up as a sci-fi action movie called "Independence Day".

'Idiotic' is the first thing that comes to my mind when talking about this movie.Only 1 ship had landed 20 years back,but it only gets investigated 20 years later when the lights come back on. Liam Helmsworth almost crashes an ultra-expensive weapon, then saves it, but nobody bats an eyelid. He asks everyone to exit the hangar, and everyone just...does. He steals a craft, comes to Earth, goes back to the moon, and then back to Earth, but nobody arrests him. An array of alien-tech weapons surrounding the Earth is remembered at the last possible moment. Last time, they needed lots of modifications to be able to pilot the alien crafts, but this time around, they seem to be tailor-made for humans. The alien mega-ship lands on water and starts to drill in the middle of the ocean, when it could easily have landed over land(It would have killed a lot more of us, and that is what they want, right?). Heroic fight sequences ensue, where not one of the central characters can be hit by the aliens(It does, however, prove that the aliens did not produce this!). The current POTUS addresses the ex-POTUS as President. The Queen can activate huge ships from light-years away. She can control small alien crafts but decides to get hit a few times first. Liam Helmsworth loves the 2 words 'fusion drive' very much and thinks they are the solution to everything. Small alien crafts can supposedly escape the Queen's control if they fly too high, and keep escaping even when they are close again!!! A lot of the scenes are there which are almost the same as the original movie(with better VFX). After making sure they have set up one(or more) sequels, the movie finally ends.....don't complain if you have a headache. It's NORMAL!

Will Smith must have taken a breath of relief in his million dollar penthouse....for not being in this movie. Definitely, as against pretty decent apocalyptic scenes movie had, it could have had a disastrous invasion on his Hollywood career!Though the visuals seem to be massive and give you bang-for-buck entertainment, but they fail to instill a sense of emergency, a innate feeling that doom is really about to wipe out the earth. Destruction is limited to just US and China. All other countries seems to be busy watching sitcoms and eating at McDonalds.And whats with Liam Hemsworth and the young cast? Seems like I am watching teenage college movie,..all of them trying desperately to pull off a school project of saving earth! And yes that typical scene of girlfriend kissing the protagonist before he leaves for the mission as if that's gonna save his ass from aliens which no other bombs and missiles can.Though the movie gives way to a 3rd part, I am not keeping high hopes on that one either.

Was very reluctant before going into the movie theater as I read all the reviews here, god they are so wrong. The movie was very much entertaining and the CGI was amazing to the core. The plot had it's dull moments but overall it was crisp and simple to follow. The references to the first part was great and not over used. Overall watchable more than once and you would enjoy it. The BG music is great and not hurting the ears. What I loved the most was the movie never tried to setup something for the sequel, which has become a trend now a days. Director Roland Emmerich did an excellent job and the screenplay was gripping. The action starts of ten minutes into the movie.

Twenty years ago, when ID4 came out, I was pump like everyone else to see the Empire State building blow up (This was pre 9/11 of course), but Independence Day became a classic because it was all about us uniting in our darkest hour to become one and fight for the greater good. This movie concentrates on that latter more than the former.The suspense of the aliens coming was not as cool as the first movie. It was not as interesting as you think catching up with the old guard from the original and getting to know the new. Then things start blowing up, and it felt like the filmmakers were going after landmarks we did not see get blown up in the first film, and it was not that interesting.What was interesting is when the war between us an the aliens begins. That's also when it got real corn ball. Bill Pullman as former President Whitmore gives a more informal speech than he did in ID4 to rally the troops but he's not the only one who get a few lines that spread hope. It seem like everyone has trying for a tear jerking moment.Then the butt kicking begins on both sides, and that's when the movie gets live. It's interesting that I find the special effects better in the first one (or it could be the design of ID4 was better), but the battle scenes were top notch, very video gamy at times, but none the less, it was like Star Wars. Plus the aliens themselves get more screen time and it looks like the focus more on that with the effects. Without Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum leads the charge as a quirky leading man. Along side him is a large number of characters from the first movie, that give Resurgence the emotional ties needed. Then Liam Hemsworth leads the next gen heroes (most of which like Captain Dylan Hillier, were children in the first movie now all grown up), which is a real ensemble cast of characters who all get a chance to shine, making the sci-fi action movie even more epic.I have to mention, however that their corny attempts to create a united earth are very superficial. Unless I'm overreaching, Independence Day: Resurgence happens in a universe where 9/11 never happen, because the the first invasion made us whole before that event, making a Utopian time line (though one subplot evolves a peaceful, but tense cease fire with certain places in Africa where pieces of the mother ship landed and they had hand to hand battles with the aliens). It would have been nice to see a more imaginative angle of what that would have looked like. China does make an appearance in the movie, but that's only to assure the movie makes money in that country (assuming this is also why Angelababy, who I believe is a huge star over there is part of the main cast). I noticed America has a lot of technology while the people in the Middle East are living in caves and seem to be spectators in the fight. Am I asking too much that Mustafa Mohammed be part of the global battle in this Space opera fantasy?It would not have ruin the film for me, but maybe for others it would have interrupted the corny with a side o cheesy the delivery of July 4th being a world holiday is, but none the less it was worth watching in IMAX 3D. It will never be as mind blowing as cities across the globe have been destroyed numerous times in films since the twenty years that ID4 came out, but when Independence Day came out, some professional film critic called it "this generation's Star Wars" and Independence Day: Resurgence does a decent job trying to live up to that.

I thought 'Now You See Me 2' was the most boring movie of the year, but now that I've watched Independence Day Resurgence it is going to be hard to decide which movie can claim this title.The movie starts off with a lot of expositional dialogue that these summer blockbusters just cannot seem to avoid. After which it sets up the characters with a lot of unnecessary conflicts and love interests. By the time the aliens show up the movie had already lost my attention and what was left was just some dull CGI action scenes which were very predictable and cliché.The movie is filled to the brim with a lot of side-characters who do not contribute anything to the plot and are only there for some funny one-liners. Well funny, the only fun part in these one-liners came from the terrible delivery caused by the extremely bad acting to be blamed in part to the very bland directing. The movie just goes from scene to scene and the director never really tries to mix in a little bit of his own style to make the film stand apart from all the other blockbuster movies that came before it.A lot of these scenes themselves contain multiple moments that do not make any sense at all which even the most unattentive viewer could point out. Like how does a simple boat have instruments that can measure the depth a space ship has drilled into the earth. Or why do only the voices of the main characters come over the command center's comms system when there are a hundred other pilots in the air. There are a ton of more moments like these, but listing them all would need more words than what is allowed in a comment.In the end what is left is a movie that is very forgetful and I cannot recommend it to anyone. My rating: 3/10

I liked it very good special affects. Some funny moments. You need to watch the first movie to understand who all the much older actors with recurring roles fit into the plot. That being said my wife who hadn't watched the first movie in a while did't understand.The best part is that even people who don't like violent movies don't mind seeing bad guy aliens dying.I especially liked that Will Smith wasn't in the movie. Some of his lines in the first movie were funny but I was turned off by most of his lines which were a rehash of his The Fresh Prince of Bel- Air lingo.the finale left room for future sequels more like a star wars genre

Within only two hours, air-crafts from here will join others from around the world. And the second largest aerial battle in this history of mankind will unleash. Despite being 20 years overdue, disaster movie director Roland Emmerich continues his 1996 summer hit.Now with more advanced technology, Independence Day: Resurgence attempts to outdo the Oscar-winning visual effects of the original by adding quadruple the visual effects shots of what the original had. Almost all these effects are done with computers, but it still adds tremendous scale appropriately matching this newly arrived mother ship that took 20 years to improve for the next pursuit. This time, the ship is the size of the entire moon, and not even two decades could prepare our newly changed society for this.Most of the original cast is back in action, and that old mixture of humor and disaster returns with the same nostalgic undertones of the original. There are many calls back to the first movie, and there are numerous subplots that span across the world, also like the original.Although there's nothing as memorable as the shot of the White House getting blown to smithereens, there are still plenty of satisfactory images that can help you to forgive the weak efforts of everything else.It all begins with the alternate 2016 from the world of this film series, where the current president is now a woman. Mankind now has a new meaning, for it took so much to recover from the war of '96. But it's paid off: they now have an international moon base where half-trillion dollar weapons are stationed in case of another invasion. Down in the state of Nevada, Area 51 is established as a grounds where they imprison the aliens. Over in Central Africa, the Rebel Forces now have high-advanced armory, and are working with America to analyze a mother ship that has rested there since the war. These newly established relations suggest how the world is no longer consumed by petty differences, but rather united in common interests.This future is a pretty cool alternate reality, if only the characters lived up to it. Jeff Goldblum is back as the co-lead, and he is doing just about everything you'd expect Jeff Goldblum to do. As for the other stilted actors, Liam Hemsworth plays a new pilot on the moon base, and of course has some sort of love story with the typical female side character. Vivica A. Fox plays a potential love interest for, and I could barely understand her half the time because of her accent. Jessie T. Usher is rather interesting as the son of Captain Hiller, but he mostly reminds us how much better this movie could have been with Will Smith.But the focus isn't on the acting. It's on the intense, horrifying imagery that makes big summer movies so amazing. It's on the cinematic presentation of everyone fighting for their freedom—not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution—but from annihilation. When the mother ship first arrives on Earth, genuine fear is felt as Britain's major monuments burn up in the apocalyptic red smoke, ascending into zero gravity from the impact. Then from there, the mother ship launches its plasma beam into the earth's core through the Atlantic Ocean. It's obviously done with computers, but the shadows the ship makes over the sea makes us terrified for our right to live, to exist.Off in the US, places are flooded, leaving a bunch of possibly orphaned siblings to drive off with another man they rescued from the debris. These little personal elements add to the personal at- home feeling of how doomsday affects the entire world.So sure enough, hundreds—literally hundreds of jets are sent out to fight the mother ship in an overwhelming blizzard of lasers. It's spectacular to watch on a large screen, and may just as well be worth watching in 3D, if you don't mind the overcrowding of things to look at on screen.Although, I wonder if maybe the suspense could have been greater if we never saw the aliens. It's not just that they were the worst special effect in the film, but because they simply did not add much to the enjoyment, and made the film's overall impact less meaningful. But it is still nice to see the turquoise tint of the ship's inside with the aliens' simple design, just like old times.I will admit, Independence Day: Resurgence doesn't quite step it up from the movie we all grew up with. Its attempted message of worldly union is entirely forgotten by the last few moments, making this film go quietly into the night, vanishing without a fight. But guess what else? The attempted message is still true: No matter what nationality we are, we are all one people. We should be united as a world, not putting up walls or voting against the union with another continent. Maybe this movie didn't do it exactly the way it needed to, but its message still needs to be communicated now more than ever, if we wish to live on and survive. I hope we can keep this in mind as we celebrate our Independence Day!Overall Grade: C

One of the laziest cash-grab screenplays ever committed to celluloid, I hope this one flops for that very reason. But, like the brainless 'Transformers' series, this might end up over-performing anyway.Examples of said laziness: The central conceit here, drilling for the Earth's core, has already been done, to greater effect (?) in Zack Snyder's much-reviled 'Man of Steel' (the Kryptonian world engine). All the alien life-forms, including the hive-mentality, and a queen - the 'Alien(s)' franchise. Dogfights - Star wars. I could drone on and on, especially about the heavy degree to which one has to suspend disbelief throughout its viewing. Throughout. The areas where I did see some effort:* 3D conversion: More decent than most conversion efforts. Smooth, and maybe even seamless.* Few of the spectacles. Not including the climax, which seemed muted / forced.* The way Emmerich dispatches, permanently, most characters returning from the 1st one. It IS by-the-numbers, but a bold move nevertheless, one I did not see coming. * Jeff Goldblum. Brent Spiner.In sum, the 1st one was a well-made B movie, a guilty pleasure of sorts, much like most of Michael Bay's flicks (not including 'Transformers', but something like 'The Island', or 'Armageddon'). This pointless, needless, completely redundant sequel, on the other hand, is a complete waste of time, effort and hard-earned dough. It makes other mainstream flicks made by Emmerich himself, seem like classic works of art, in comparison, though they're C-grade, at best, albeit guilty of having a few grand moments, overall. Even the painfully obvious call-out for a future sequel is lame / pathetic.I wasted mine - try not to waste yours.

Needless to say, I recognize the problems of the original Independence Day: some of its humor is forced, the characters feel exaggerated and there are absolutely ridiculous moments (not to mention its laughable ultra-patriotism). However, I find it very entertaining, and despite all the years which have gone by, I keep enjoying it when I occasionally find it on some TV channel during the middle of the night. Nevertheless, I didn't expect very much from Independence Day: Resurgence, a largely delayed sequel which would hardly capture the historical moment like its predecessor did in 1996, establishing the pattern which would be followed by uncountable blockbusters during the following 20 years. My main concern for the sequel was that it would focus too much on the special effects while ignoring the characters. However, I was wrong. Independence Day: Resurgence places very much emphasis on the characters... unfortunately, the big majority of them is irrelevant, hollow and antipathetic. And the screenplay is a noisy combination of scenes and situations which never "connect" with each other in order to bring us a fluid story. I know that many persons hate director Roland Emmerich, but I'm not one of them. I don't consider him a genius either, but I respect the fact he found a cinematographic niche compatible with his bombastic vision; despite their problems, I generally find his films entertaining. Independence Day: Resurgence couldn't even achieve that; I found it boring despite the constant action, and it didn't make me feel the slightest excitement or suspense. And the worst thing of all is that a few good ideas occasionally emerge from the screenplay, but they are immediately ignored in favor of a bad joke, or another action scene lacking of any substance. As for the characters, they are all poorly written; the ones who had already appeared in the first film aren't given anything substantial to do, specially David Levinson; Jeff Goldblum is an excellent actor, but the presence of his character in here feels absolutely unnecessary. As for the "new" ones, they don't have anything interesting to do, or at least, support their existence with actions. Among the few positive things I can say about Independence Day: Resurgence, I can mention the very good special effects and the fact that they gave the great Brent Spiner work. For the rest, it's a tedious and unnecessary sequel. Anyway, Emmerich pretends to complete the trilogy (the ending of Independence Day: Resurgence leaves that intention very clear), so there's still a possibility to redeem this saga. Let me know in 20 years, please.

So just last night I was at the double feature Independence Day showing the original ID4 along with Resurgence right after and I have to admit that I enjoyed IDR quite a bit. I think the problem many people have with the film is that it comes off of a big classic such as Independence Day that many general audience moviegoers actually really enjoy. I mean, my Mom isn't a sci-fi fan at all, but she knows almost every line in ID4 and loves the film. On the other hand, I am a huge sci-fi fan and I also love the original film and hold it in high regard.One of the problems with today's movie-going audience, and maybe I should just say today's movie critics both professional and armature, is that they often have too high of expectations for any movie that comes out. Had the original Independence Day been released today instead of 20 years ago, it would be ripped to shreds. So would films like Ghostbusters, Close Encounters, The Terminator, Aliens, and probably even the original Star Wars, but at the time they were revolutionary, cutting-edge, and new. Nowadays there are so many B- films that so many people just write-off because they don't see the potential or had too high of expectations going in. We all expect every movie to be as entertaining as The Avengers, as compelling as Inception, or as character driven as Shawshank Redemption, but the truth is that a movie is a movie and ultimately art is subjective, and film is art.But with that out of the way, let's talk about Independence Day: Resurgence. Resurgence takes place 20 years after the original film and kind of just jumps right into the action. The basics are that one of the Alien Queen's has decided to attack Earth and suck up all its resources in retaliation for their original defeat 20 years ago, while Earth has used become united under the UN and has used alien tech to advance their planet for intergalactic warfare if necessary.One of my favorite parts of this film was how the original cast was used. Between David now being a part of Earth's defense and discovering the original alien drill (which hadn't been researched in the last 20 years apparently though they do explain why), to President Whitmore having visions of the aliens and their plan, even to Dr. Okun returning from his 20 year coma and helping fight the aliens once again, everyone that was brought back worked well within the context of the story.The new cast also did a good job, and I enjoyed the return of characters from the original as well. One thing Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin get, in my opinion, is characters, it's just their specialty. You can have a big, great story like ID4 but if you don't have Goldblum or Will Smith to lead the film and to be full-fledged characters it's not going to mean anything because we don't care. Like I said before, I think the new characters worked, but I wish that they will a little more fleshed out so that we cared a bit more, but with the old cast returning it would've been hard to do.Resurgence did a good job at raising the stakes from the first movie, while the last film had many ships all over the globe bent on wiping out humanity, this film had one big ship covering half the Earth, bent on collecting all of Earth's resources, while the Queen and her ship went looking for their Enemy (who became Earth's ally).I will say there were a lot of themes or plot lines I did not like from IDR. Hollywood keeps promoting this global government agenda and IDR continues that trend with the UN basically being a one world government. Dr. Okun having a relationship with his lab partner was obviously another agenda that Hollywood has been shoving down our throats that I don't care for at all. Then of course the transhumanist agenda was also being pushed, the idea that the other alien that comes to Earth to help humanity was once an organic lifeform decided to transcend its body by becoming a digital lifeform. This is another agenda that has been circulating throughout the media and quite frankly I can see why based on how technology obsessed America is as a nation. It's sad really.As I said before I really had a good time. It also sets up a third film that looks to be completely set in outer-space, which would be an awesome way to make another Independence Day film different from the original, and even this sequel. One thing I told my brother while we were in the theater was that the movie really seemed like it should have been a video game, and I still hold to that thought. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I definitely think that this film played out like a video game would. Maybe I'm wrong. Either way, many of the themes and story concepts that I had wanted to TNT series Falling Skies to introduce (intergalactic war, space battles, natural resource draining, alien queens, etc.) actually seemed to be either used or set-up in this movie, which was oddly satisfying for me as a sci-fi fan and as someone who wanted the Independence Day franchise to continue on in the future.All-in-all, I really enjoyed Independence Day: Resurgence. Fans of the original film may either hate it or love it, it honestly depends on how big into science-fiction they are in my opinion, and new fans who are starting out with this film can jump on no-problem. There's something in it for everyone and at the end of the day I was satisfied and highly anticipating a sequel.

Independence Day: Resurgences is the 2016 science fiction action film that is directed by Roland Emmerich and is the sequel to the 1996 film Independence Day . The film star Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, Vivica A.Fox and Brent Spiner all reprise their roles from the previous film, new cast members include Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jessie Usher and William Fichtner.Twenty years have passed since the events of the previous film and the human race has enjoyed peace and has used the technology from the crashed alien ships for the Earth Space Defence to fend off any threats.But somewhere in South Africa David Levinson is lead to a ship that is still intact from the 1996 attack, the ship looks like it was attempting to drill into the earth's core when the mothership was destroyed. Once inside David discovers that a distress call was sent to the alien homeland and learns that another alien ship is heading for earth but also a different craft that could hold the key to preventing earth's destructionRoland Emmerich and Dean Devlin return as writers and director of the film and i have to say that I'm disappointed with the film. I believe that the 1996 film is a great film for its time and should have been left alone, the 1996 film didn't need a sequel to it and now after 20 years we get this film. The character development was poor, the CGI at the start of the film were a little shaky but improved in the main action sequences.The situations and problems that the characters faced were straightforward to solve and things seemed to go their way at the end. There were very little destruction sequences in the film, no tension in any scenes, no excitement in the film and the soundtrack was bland and just used most of the music from the first film.Will Smith didn't return for this film and his character is missed, he gave a very good performance in the first film with his character being full of humour but also seriousness. Liam Hemsworth does his best to fill the boots of Will Smith's character but doesn't come close.The ship maybe bigger this time but the film is a let down.For more reviews checkout https://filmorder.wordpress.com/

I love all types of CGI movies, as long as they have high quality CGI in them I will watch them.I enjoyed watching this movie. Yes I should admit that the music and directing weren't top notch and it wasn't as moving as the first one but still if you like sci-fi movies you will like it. Just lower your expectations.Everything is relative, if this movie with this type of special effects was released 10 years ago it would have been amazing.We are so used to big budget movies with spectacular scenes that we want bigger, more breath-taking, more fantastic, more whatever instead of just enjoying a movie in the present moment as is. Just watch it and stop comparing and judging.I am looking forward to a sequel, based on the clues given in this movie the next one supposed to be simply fantastic.

In the sequel to the original science fiction disaster movie Independence Day a mix of the old cast (minus Will Smith) and some new get to take on another alien invasion, this time even more dangerous with even less time.Therein lays the first problem. The movie tackles the alien invasion in a very similar angle to the previous one. No interesting new stuff or an alien perspective on things, just another, bigger ship coming along to take our stuff. Although the mothership finds Earth because of a distress signal, no efforts are made by the aliens to save their kin, who are just locked up. It seems like they're trying to mix things up by throwing in a rival race, but they end up not using that at all except to advance the plot and bait a sequel. But a simple plot might work, maybe it looks really cool? Although the actual effects are mostly well made (I specifically had problems with some of the CGI on the aliens and crowds) they are used to varying effects. Some of the sci-fi looks really bland or overdone, most notably the moon base and the giant ship, but some of it looked smart. In my opinion, the mix of alien and human stuff looked the best of the movie.Sadly, the spaceships do not come to their right in this movie. Most of the dogfights were boring and those are the main action scenes. The camera shook a lot during them and the level of zoom was never right, either focusing on a pilots expression or showing the battle from afar in all its sci-finess but too chaotic to distinguish anything. Firefights weren't that glorious either, with main characters having thick plot armour and impeccable aim.Not that I cared much. Most main characters didn't have arcs or really boring ones, with backstory and motivation delivered ham-fisted. Most things the characters said were either a one-liner, created comic relief or advanced the plot. There were a few 'inspiring' speeches, but I felt only 1 worked. They seemed to have some interesting ideas, with an African warlord that has fought aliens his whole life and a guy that cared for Okun in a coma, but both were only used to deliver one-liners, comic relief or advance the plot.Honestly, the movie doesn't have much going for it, but what makes it worse is the insane love it has for the original. Although he is not in the movie, Will Smiths character is deified and except for one character everyone from the last movie is treated with great respect at all times. It's a love letter to the original, without telling us what exactly was so great about the first one anyway.(note: I rate movies on a 3-star scale, with a 4 corresponding to 1 star and 0 stars reserved for the absolute worst.)

I went into Independence Day: Resurgence with my brain well and truly switched off. A sequel to one of my favourite films was always going to attract my attention but I was always a bit cautious as this film arrives a full twenty years after the first film.It turns out I was right to be cautious about this film because Independence Day: Resurgence really is quite rubbish. My expectations weren't high by any means but I certainly couldn't help but feel a bit deflated when I left the cinema. Twenty years to make a sequel and this is seriously the best they could do?!In the twenty years that have passed since the events in the first film, Earth has used the leftover alien technologies to create the Earth Space Defence (ESD), a united global defence program that serves as an early warning system in case of any more attacks. It's an Earth that has seen humanity united and war free for twenty years.When a much bigger threat than before arrives in Earth's atmosphere, it's not long before the ESD is well and truly tested. Humanity was able to stave off the threat once before but would they find themselves out of luck when the aliens return bigger and intent on destroying the planet?I have to say it's quite a noble effort from Roland Emmerich to make a sequel that attempts to evolve from its predecessor. The idea of the alien technology left over from the invasion of 1996 being used to enhance Earth's defence from further attacks is one that stops the film from feeling like a carbon copy of Independence Day. There are a few more elements in the plot that do this as well but I can't discuss them without spoiling the film so I'll leave those for you to discover for yourself.It's the rest of the story and the script that leaves a hell of a lot to be desired. Now, the first film is ridiculously cheesy however, this sequel takes it to almost unbearable heights with an incredibly rushed story and rather dull script. There's no effort made to break up action sequences with some low-key scenes between characters like the first film did so well. Instead, they opt for the lay down the story and character introductions in the first half hour and then go balls out crazy when the aliens show up until the end of the film.When I say balls out crazy I really do mean it. The last hour and a half is literally just a destruction montage but not necessarily the good kind. The special effects are very impressive and there are certainly moments that I had fun with however, even with my brain switched off, I eventually got a little fed up of it all. It all just lacks the swagger and grandeur the first film possessed.As for the performances, Independence Day: Resurgence misses the charisma of someone like Will Smith much more than I thought it would. Think Liam Hemsworth or Jessie T. Usher have the charisma to be a replacement? Think again. Hemsworth faces a career spent entirely in the shadow of his brother, Chris, unless he starts putting in some decent performances while Usher is totally void of any emotion in his performance.Jeff Goldblum tries his hardest but he ultimately ends up looking lost amongst the mess that this film eventually becomes and Bill Pullman very much hams it up as the President who led the resistance back in 1996 but now experiences visions of a pending attack. Judd Hirsch also returns but in a totally unnecessary subplot that makes it seem like it was a last minute decision just to give him something to do. Oh, and Sela Ward stars as the current President but she's barely worth mentioning and you'll understand why when you see the film.The film culminates in an unsatisfying finale that possesses one of the most sequel baiting final scenes you will ever see. I pretty much hated the final scene and I didn't really want to hate any of this film. I know I've already said that my brain was switched off as soon as I sat down in the cinema however, there's no escaping the fact that, with twenty years to prepare, Independence Day: Resurgence should have been so much better.

There was not one redeeming quality to this movie; in fact, the producers should be force to refund our money. No chemistry, no humor, not one good scene, rather, we spent the ride home listing the top 10 worst scenes only to realize we needed a Top 100 list!There were multiple disjointed scenes where the script writer obviously was not concerned. For example, in the opening scenes, we're told of a world at peace where there had been no wars for 20 years. A couple of scenes, we're treated to a scene where a "warlord" is introduced who appeared anything but peaceful.Bill Pullman needs a cane at the beginning of the movie, near the end, he's a Top Gun pilot willing to sacrifice his life to deliver the package. The list could go on. It really was that bad.Do not waste your time. I was prepared for a mediocre film that was mildly entertaining but rather received a movie that was beyond bad. If you feel you must see it, wait a year and go pick up a discounted copy in a reduced price bin at Walmart.You have been warned!

There's only one thing to say about this movie ..."AWFUL" Do yourself a favor and save your money for another movie.. Even with the advances in CGI etc, the 1996 "Independence Day" with less technical screen enhancements etc is still worthy of seeing it again on TV where this movie is worthy of one thing "Bypassing it" for anything else...The first ten minutes of the movie is OK, but then the story falls flat on its back . Character development was lame and the story jumps around without keeping you interested. The effects of course were OK but so are all the " other" movies that fall under the CGI laden plots ..Iron man ..Avengers etc..It was so bad that walking out was a thought except for the fact that it was nice and cool in the theater and extremely hot outside....Don't see it

The movie is billed and self promotes itself as mindless fun. I found it to be far more mindless than it was fun. The main things lacking in this film that the original managed to deliver was a sense of true tension and characters that delivered charm and charisma. Resurgence has NONE of those qualities. The new cast (Will Smith's mini-me, Diet Thor and the fashion model) could ALL have been replaced with actual cardboard cut-outs and it wouldn't have changed the movie at all. They all came across as shallow and soulless. Jeff Goldblum delivered as usual and Brent Spiner was a true treat. Those two single-handedly engineered any saving graces this film does manage to deliver. The coincidences and the plot itself are so asinine that it's hard to enjoy as even pure popcorn fluff. The ending that sets up another sequel actually elicited groans from my audience. Sad to say but this sequel twenty years in the making should have stayed in the developmental stage.

This movie had $165.000.000 budget, great cast, but yet the worst science fiction movie in history. How can a schoolbus go from a traffic jam to suddenly on salt flats? And a massive airship with a shieldbarrier and a weakspot never gets boring? I can't remember a movie in which every single dialogue was cheesy. And then there was Julius Levinson using his boat as a surfboard on a 2000 feet tall wave.. which eventually ended up with him being knocked out on his boat, high and dry??? Am not even gonna mention Dikembe Umbutu...If you like depth and science fiction be sure to skip this movie.

Independence Day was one of those movies that everyone seems to have in their collection. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum brought buddy to the Sci-Fi in the mid 90's. The result was the spectacular, alien invasion movie of the decade.Fast forward 20 years and everything has changed. Will Smith is no longer with us (in the film). Goldblum returns, as well as a myriad of old faces. However this, the second outing, fails to ignite like the first film. Don't get me wrong, the film is good and well worth a watch- but don't be expecting that same magic. The movie has a different tone, all be it a recognizable one. Aliens come to earth, man must "find a way" to survive the onslaught and save themselves from near destruction. Nothing to the plot really, that is it! It should be the characters that drive this film. Goldblum reprises his role as Dr. Levinson with his usual dry charm. He is appealing and can really hold his own. However he just doesn't get the right screen time. Goldblum is an interesting actor and one I have never been able to figure out. I have also never worked out what it is that is so likable about the man - yet he is likable and watchable. One of the flaws of this movie is the missing "buddy" partnership. It always feels like Goldblum is in need of someone to bounce from. He doesn't really get that support in the film. His presence is a welcomed sight on the big screen though. Chris Hemsworth's brother provides the lovable rogue figure. His character Jake Morrison seems to be made up of existing characters from some of Hollywoods greatest action movies. He is the Maverick, the John McClane, the Martin Riggs of this movie. Again, you don't really get to see his character develop through the film and that is slightly under hand. His character would have been perfect opposite Goldblum. Jessie Usher takes the helm as Will Smiths son. An air force Captain, who looks as though he just graduated high school. He pus in a good performance, but hasn't the character and charisma of his "father". He lacks that impact, again possibly due to the poor development of back story and character. There is some fine support from Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner. All three add great viewing and individual performances worthy of merit. The film itself is laden with special effects, of which there are no complaints. They are spectacular! The script is far from dull, however does not capitalize on certain back stories and characters that would have birthed some interesting angles as the story unfolds. At time the movie suffers from claustrophobia, like it is suffocating on its own existence. Again, it is very watchable, but does not flow as well as it could. Most apparent is the films direction. It was left with a wide open door to a sequel.The film is over the top, brash at times and seemingly thoughtless. What made the first movie great was the belief that an invasion could actually happen (for the two hours you are sat watching it). This movie does not! Man has integrated its own technology with alien technology and instantly that takes away from the magic of the atmosphere. I wanted to see man, overcome all the odds and defeat aliens with a tooth brush and a clothes peg. All this being said, the movie has some good one liners. Character interaction is good, when it happens. The effects are phenomenal. It is good to see a stellar cast and the homage to other movies within Hollywood history makes you smile. Would I rate this film - yes. It is worth a watch. Two hours of substance that will give you enough to make you happy. Although you may come away feeling a tad frustrated. Cheese rating is 10.

To be honest when I went into the movie theater to watch this movie I wasn't expecting much. I didn't go in expecting it to be some cinematic masterpiece that'd have me in tears at the end or change my way of thinking. All I expected from it was just a good old "humanity fights off giant alien invasion and wins." Yeah, looking back it wasn't as impressive as the first movie but at least it kept me entertained. The main reason I don't think it's as impressive as the first movie is that it's set in a future where humanity has advanced technologically about 100 years in the span of 20. I mean granted it meant nothing when the aliens finally came back but the first film seemed more impressive because we didn't have any fancy alien gadgets to help us. All we had were regular missiles, machine guns, and rockets. Also I don't like the extensive use of CGI this movie used. It just doesn't look real to me. In the first film, when you see the aliens they at least look real to you because actual models was used, but in CGI they look like regular direct-to-DVD SyFy movie aliens. I also felt like the whole robotic sphere thing could've been discarded. It really didn't add that much that the main cast didn't already know. "The aliens are controlled by a queen and they'll all stop if she dies." I think the humans already knew that by the time the one aliens said "She's here" and they saw a giant alien in infra-red. All in all, was it as impressive as the first movie? No. Did it keep me entertained? Yes. This isn't a movie you should go in expecting it to be on par with Citizen Kane. You should just go in expecting it to be a good old fashion dumb alien invasion movie.

Maybe I expect too much. Compared with ID4, I couldn't feel much tension and passion during 2 hours. Be honest, it's still a good popcorn movie, but it just can't make you really high!Also as a Taiwanese, I strongly felt Hollywood really want to make money by kissing Chinese ass. It's not a bad thing. But even my Chinese friends think the way they used in this film is just too obviously and rough.Angelababy is a famous young actress in China but her acting can't support the character.In addition, they also put some sub story line like they did in ID4. However, all story lines combined in a great way in ID4. This time you may feel some story line is not necessary.I would only recommend people who expect a normal popcorn movie to go to theater. If you are looking for a bible class movie, you may think about it.PS.: I watched ID4 again after couple days, and I realized 20 years ago, our standard is much lower than present day. Maybe I am just too harsh to this movie.

What a piece of warm crap. I loved the first and you ruined this for an entire generation. Took something good and lets loose a load of diarrhea on it. What a total waste of time and money. No storyline. Crud acting and dialogue. Ripoff of first movie. Throw common sense out the window. If you are OK with this you might enjoy it. You guys made movie magic with this. So bad....not seen anything this bad in years. Hopefully enough people comment on this to save good people from wasting their time on this. You took my independence today!

In less than an hour, reviewers from here will join others around the world. And you will lose the largest battle in the history of movies.Movies - that word should have a new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty cinema anymore. We will be united in our common interests.Perhaps it's fate that today is not the 4th of July. Today, you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution - but from annihilation of good movies. We're fighting for our right to have good movies exist.And should we lose the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American Holiday, but the day when the movie-going world declared in one voice: WE WILL NOT GO TO YOUR CINEMAS IN THE NIGHT! WE WON'T BE VANISHED WITHOUT A FIGHT! MOVIES ARE GOING TO LIVE! MOVIES ARE GOING TO SURVIVE! BUT TODAY, WE WON'T CELEBRATE OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY!-President Whitmore

Unbelievable ! 20 years of expectation and just for this? The characters are so low-characterized that it become a impressively dull movie !! Lough the visual is as stunning as usual , but it lacks the heart of the predecessor .Despite the visual stuff , everything is nearly disappointed .I thought it could just at least be as entertaining as Jurassic World , but it didn't even have enough stuff to compare with it .The montage is too order-less ,the story is too lazy and the length is too short , it doesn't quite meet the audience's expectation , not to mention 20 years of waiting .

There are a lot of people that are hating on the film, probably went in expecting something and didn't receive it. If your into aliens, the universe, like to stare at the stars you'll probably enjoy this film. It really captured my imagination. And it really expands on the previous film (which I loved, it was the first sci-fi film I saw). I remember watching the first one on VHS multiple times, this new film brought back great memories. ---Going to talk about the cast now, so stop here if your like me and prefer not see an entire trailer and go into a film blind. Go see it! In IMAX/XD if you can. I was a bit upset not to see Will Smith come back, however it really allowed other actors to shine. Jeff Goldblum was awesome, very witty, his humor was great. ---Possible spoiler alert (from my view, again a trailer is a spoiler to me.) Dr. Brackish played a big role, OMG was he amazing! Provided necessary comic relief, he was incredible, Brent Spiner gets a standing ovation from me. Another hidden gem in the film was Dikembe Umbutu, played by Deobia Oparei(GoT&Pirates of Caribbean) he was a real old school warrior, *spolier alert* taking on the Aliens in hand to hand combat, amazing. The former president was great too, he does give a speech to be reckoned with, for a second time. I have to mention Liam Hemsworth, this was his best role he's ever had, and he was perfect, though it can't be easy with Thor as your older brother. Judd Hirsch was great, funny and witty as always. I wondered if it was going to be the CGi'd version of the first, but it wasn't, it expands on the first and comes to a great conclusion. With a moral that no one seems to want to listen to. Hopefully there is a 3rd! It won't be easy to do, but if it's done, I hope someone like Peter Jackson is at the helm. And I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did. Thanks for reading.

I saw "Independence Day:Resurgence", starring Liam Hemsworth-The Hunger Games movies, The Expendables 2; Jessie T. Usher-When the Game Stands Tall, Survivor's Remorse_tv; Maika Monroe-The 5th Wave, Labor Day and Sela Ward-Gone Girl, The Day After Tomorrow.This is a sequel to the 1996 original 'Independence Day'-Wow, 20 years later! It's directed by the same director, too, Roland Emmerich-besides the original, he has directed White House Down, The Day After Tomorrow, Stargate and Universal Soldier. Not too bad of a resume. Most of the original cast return-Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Brent Spiner and Vivica A. Fox-but since it has been 20 years, they are passing the franchise along to the younger generation. FYI: Notably missing from the original cast is Will Smith. I heard that there was a money issue, with Will wanting $50 million. In case you miss him, they do show pictures of Will, as a hero of the alien battle of '96. They say he was killed testing out an alien hybrid ship. The connections between the young and the old actors are; Liam lost his parents in the first movie so he is an orphan and now a hot shot pilot. He is also engaged to Maika, who is the daughter of former President Bill, which would make him the son-in-law to Bill. Jessie is another hot shot pilot and the son of deceased Will and Vivica. Sela is the new President- foreshadowing of Hillary Clinton, maybe? As far as plot goes, the alien technology recovered from the first film has been incorporated to improve ours. We now have bases on our moon, Mars and moons of Saturn-We gotta keep an eye out for any returning aliens. And, of course they do return, bigger and badder. There mother ship lands on Earth and covers the whole Atlantic ocean! Seems like no hope for us, but lucky for us, we have Liam and company. Lots of destruction and famous monuments being destroyed. And I also heard that Roland has announced a 3rd installment is in the works. It's rated "PG-13" for sci-fi action and destruction and language and has a running time of 2 hours. I enjoyed this one and would buy it on DVD.

I enjoyed the first film, because I expected it be a fun Alien movie. Acting wasn't bad, not a horrible script, (but not a great either. Come on, it's a sci-fi, defend your planet Alien movie). I knew the kind of movie I was walking into. Grab popcorn, soda and twizzlers, hand over your bi-weekly paycheck to the concession worker, leave your brain at the door and enjoy the special effects that flood across the screen, and have the sound blow your face off. But..... I felt it failed to even do that. The visuals where great and professional. I really wanted to enjoy this film and a fun ride but couldn't. When I left, I felt I waste two hours of my life. I was excited for this one, better Special Effects, thy brought back Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman added Liam Hemsworth whom I respect as actors. Roland Emmerich had a handful of talent to work with but unfortunately the acting talent could only go as far the quality of the script. I felt the script was often anti- climatic during a few parts. The dialogue was awkward at a parts, like suggusting to make out with someone at the end and delivered more awkwardly with bad editing. It surprised me to see how many people worked on this script, which turned out horrible. Look on the writing section. There are five people who worked on the script . Who knows how many re-writes and they couldn't come up with something with a little more substance? Just once in these Alien invasion movies, I would like at least one character who isn't a cardboard cut out. (maybe I'm wrong, and there is one but I can't remember. ) But I guess I can't asks for too much in these type of sci-fi movies. I felt the editing was horrible. I feel the editing ruined what could have been and exciting or nice moments, into an anti-climatic scene. SPOILER*********The only good part for me is when the President and her crew get's taken out. Let me explain. It's not because the President's a woman, or unpatriotic, I live in the states and love it. It's because I felt the movie portrayal of politicians was impulsive and somewhat idiotic. Which, I think, is the only believable and realistic part of the script that made any sense.Well anyways, if you go see, try your best to enjoy it. I tried.

Another lame Sci-Fi piece. Old independence day is like a masterpiece of all times compared to its second shot. Acting is lame as it gets, only the cast from the first part did some real acting, young ones played soap-opera as its worst, even Starship Troopers had better acting. Music was somewhere there in the background but it had now influence on movie's action whatsoever. Special effect were first class. Movie's plot is as lame as it gets and offends sane people. Alien mother ship was so huge that in reality its entry into our atmosphere would burn out whole oxygen in minutes killing everything on this planet. What was the reason to harvest Earth's core? There are billions of planets with cores to be harvested, bigger, better, easier to access without risking a Queen to be wasted by armed monkeys. The best thing though, is an African warlord decoding Alien language muahhahaha:) In my humble opinion, decoding completely unknown, alien form of communication would take hundreds of years because there is no anchor point to compare it to anything we already understand. Summary...Acting 1/10, special effects 9/10, plot 2/10, stupidity 10/10, waste of time factor 5/10. Is it worth to be watched on big screen? Only to reward CGI team because acting was...it wasn't:)

Horrible on so many levels: - Story - Script - Acting - EditingOutside of these minor items and the idiotic leaps of logic in almost every scene, this is a pretty boring movie. Good gosh...It must be a lot of work to make a movie this awful. If you decide to go, you'll only get about 5 minutes in before you realize how pitiful this thing is. If you miss the 5 minute awful point, don't worry, you'll have face-palming reminders of how crappy this movie is every ten or so minutes thereafter. I usually find something redeeming in the worst of films to rate them a 4, 5, or 6. Not in this pigeon poo floater....

This is a clear case of being willing to put out swill in order to make a few bucks. It's a pretty shameless mess despite the few bright spots, such as pretty good acting and some mildly interesting design work.The idea of the aliens coming back bigger and meaner could have made a wonderfully dark movie, but instead we're force fed a retread of the first film but without the benefit of its being fresh and new. I sit here trying to conjure up a good part worth mentioning but am coming up blank. It was just a long and tedious show. OK if pushed I'd have to say that Liam Hemsworth makes it look easy and maybe that the sound was good. But the story is about as inventive as a preschool curriculum.

OK, I will be short. The illogical story line, massive scientific defects, and other absurdities are made up in part by short high intensity action sequences, some comic relief, grand CGI, and some interesting acting choices by characters desperately trying to make this movie work. It will be fun to watch only if you check your brain at the door.The three most distressing groups of plot points for me:1) A ONE HUNDRED TRILLION TON space ship can't land on a 12 mile thick planetary crust. If the ship's gravity is large enough to pull items off the Earth's crust it would pull the Earth and moon out of orbit.2) The logic of an "Alien Mother Being" controlling billions of hive creatures deciding to exit her ship (with limited protection) to pick up a small "ball of intelligence" defies belief.3) This super massive Alien Mother Ship had fewer fighter aircraft than a separated space disk from the original movie. Also, she had about 12 soldiers on the ground to aid her when there were Tens of Thousands of soldiers on the original hive ship (from the first movie) and therefor millions on her vessel.I said my piece, so go enjoy knowing the science/logic is really bad.

This movie is going to get bad critical reviews! The previous movie which came out in 1996 wasn't well reviewed either, but it was dumb, fun and eye popping back in the day.This new sequel takes places 20 years after the original and the aliens are back! It's up to David levinson played by Jeff Goldblum and team to save the day – again.This movie majorly suffers from Transformer-itis, with a good measure of Blow up the Queen to kill all drones syndrome thrown in for good measure. So is this movie terrible and unwatchable? Not exactly, there's good and bad.Let's start with the good parts.It's great to see quite a bit of the old cast coming back. Former president President Whitmore played by Bill Pullman is back. So is previously mentioned David and his Jewish Father. New cast members included Dylan Heller who is Will smith's character's kid from the previous movie. It's good to see them all together again. The plot moves along swiftly and the movie doesn't take too much to pick up and get going. The music is fine, the action is passable and the FX is great.Also, the film makers are self aware and they know what kind of movie they are making, thats one good thing about the film. It sometimes DOESN'T fall for the cliché. But only at times! Now comes the problematic part. Since the last 20 years visual FX has gotten a LOT easier. So easy, that every director over does it these days. From the new Terminator to Star Wars to this movie, the FX seem TOO much. There is too much going on in the screen, the eye can't focus on any one cool thing. There is 100s of cool things happening on screen! This is where the direction falters. It's the film makers job to direct the eye to something meaningful, rather than have everything blowing up and thrown at your face all at once. This is Michael bay's transformers formulae and this film also suffers from it! Then comes the rather hack job of editing. The first movie was 2 and a half hours long and had great character and human moments in-between all the spectacle. This one is rushed, it feels rushed. There is NO build-up to the alien's arrival. The build-up was the BEST part of the first movie, the anticipation of seeing those shadows covering those cities. They got rid of all of that awesomeness.There is a sudden school bus full of children thrown in good measure, the whole kids plot line comes out of NO WHERE and it feels like their introductions were left on the editing floor.There is no time to think in between the action, it's all rushed and going at break neck speeds. They should have spaced out this movie by at least 15 more minutes.The plot and story is absurd but that is one thing I was expecting all along. They do try to build more mythology about the aliens and their intergalactic war. But it all seems a bit Star Wars-ish.Some actions or things that happen don't follow logical choices but that is fine, given it's a big dumb movie.I didn't hate this film, it kept me entertained, but it is far from the brilliant original film.Fans of the first part will like it, new-comers to the genre might not get it.Rating : 6/10 . See if you like Sci-Fi, but go in with low expectations and it will be fine! P.S: They left the door open for the next part and I doubt it going to be made

The sequel to Independence Day delivers visually but story or characters fall flat in what seems like a very rushed and predictable film.20 years have passed since the invasion of earth and the human race has been preparing for another ever since using the same alien technology which was used against them to their advantage. But our enemies have also had twenty years to rethink their strategy. Its time for Round 2.The first film was big for it's time, the shot of the White House being decimated is iconic, and the movie launched Will Smith's career. It was far from a classic in the genre but it was a lot of fun because of Will Smith's character had attitude. "Welcome to Earth!" - Bam! In the sequel there is no Will Smith, there is nothing like him. We get his all-American son all grown up from the first movie with most of the cast (who didn't die) returning for smaller roles to make way for the new, younger and sexier cast who are all good enough in their roles but they needed more moments for me to warm to them which is part of the movie's problem - it all seems way too rushed! The comedy in this film made the whole affair seem a lot more lighthearted than it should have and while the original had it's light moments, one of the characters was simply there to provide comic relief and could have easily been written out to make way for more character care.The sequel has some good ideas such as humankind's use of the technology they have received at the hands of the invaders. It further adds to the invaders plans and explains more of their history but it's not fleshed out enough and borrows too much from another certain Alien franchise (with a Queen) which really rubbed me the wrong way. It just wasn't very original in the end.All in all, its a tall task to be completely original. We have seen the destruction of cities so many times now but I thought this could have been a lot better. It leaves the door way, way open for a sequel. The ending practically guarantee's it.

In 1996, Independence Day became an instant sci-fi classic largely because its cutting-edge visual effects allowed director Roland Emmerich to mount an ambitious alien-invasion epic that felt thrilling and new and unlike anything we'd seen until then. I still remember being blown out of my mind at the sight of the White House exploding into smithereens? In the years since, everyone from Emmerich himself and Michael Bay, to the folks at Marvel and DC, has found new and innovative ways to destroy the world and flatten entire cities. So much so that it's hard to find a blockbuster today that doesn't end in colossal digital carnage.But the formula's gotten rusty, and frankly CGI has got to the point where we've seen pretty much everything there is to see. How do you make a sequel then to the film that more or less invented the modern disaster movie? The answer, according to Emmerich – throw everything you've got at the screen, and hope that some of it sticks.Set two decades after mankind's triumph against the alien invaders of the last film, Independence Day: Resurgence unfolds during a happier time on Earth. There is peace, but we're much better prepared to handle similar attacks, having taken that alien technology and developed more sophisticated spacecraft and weaponry. Most of the survivors of the original film return, with former president Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) plagued by visions of the aliens' impending return, and former cable guy David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) bumped up to the top job at the Earth Space Defence. Even Dr Brackish Okun (Brent Spiner) has woken up from a 20-year coma.Conspicuous by his absence however, is Will Smith's character, Captain Steven Hiller, who died while testing Earth's first fighter jet based on alien techalthough it could be from reading this script, who knows! In his place we get Hiller's son Dylan (Jesse Usher), who has none of Will Smith's charisma. He plays a fighter pilot, alongside Jake Morrisson (Liam Hemsworth) and Jake's fiancée Patricia Whitmore (Maika Monroe), the ex-president's pretty daughter. The young 'uns are entrusted with firing back at the dastardly critters when they finally show upthis time in larger numbers, with more ammo, and in a single mothership so massive it spans across the entire Atlantic Ocean.Expectedly Emmerich fires on all cylinders when it comes to sheer spectacle. So it's not enough to merely uproot and upend major landmarks like Dubai's Burj Khalifa and Malaysia's Petronas Towers, they're dropped like matchsticks upon other landmarks like the London Eye and the Tower Bridge. It's the film's most audacious set-piece, and it's meant to be thrilling stuff, intended to make you giddy with excitement. But it's hard not to drown in the sea of pornographic destruction when the film throws out disaster after disaster, barely pausing for you to get your breath back.There are also plenty air-bound skirmishes – dogfights in the skies – but very quickly you're consumed by an overwhelming feeling of déjà vu. Only Goldblum gets a few moments of wisecracking dialogue in what otherwise feels like a soulless, deeply cynical film, whose makers typically don't bother with showing us the repercussions of such widespread global destruction. It feels as if no one really dies or is hurt despite half the planet being completely savaged.The younger cast, they just don't have the presence to match Will Smith's hotshot pilot from the earlier film. We also don't get one clear hero to root for. Apart from a few impressive bits of sheer CGI spectacle, the film is sorely lacking in memorable moments and ends up feeling like a slog. It doesn't even deliver on the promise of dumb fun. For that, it needed to be a little less dumb and a lot more fun

I'm a really big fan of Roland Emmerich's original vision of independence day which was released in 1996, it was loud, energetic and sometimes very cheesy with some charisma, resurgence over half a decade later proves that bigger is not better, nearly everything in this film is bloated, some characters are introduced into the film and then shoved a side with no real character development. Jeff Goldblum returns as the best scene stealer in the film but still the movie doesn't know what to do with him. The action sequences focuses too much on getting everything into one shot, including people, planes and sometimes aliens. This film is too noisy without there being a real explanation to it all. The overall plot is confusing as it shifts from one objective to the other. This film is packed with so much unnecessary side plots and idiot humor that this film really does come off as a want to be original film, there is no energy or charisma in this one, it does deliver some great special effects but that does not nearly make a good disaster film. It's fun seeing some of the original cast back but there's too much going on that the film shoves them aside, and let's other new characters shine that are really dull,and useless. I won't even mention the on the nose ending to set up for future sequels. It's a slow burn but is still watchable just to get a semi feeling of the nostalgic predecessor.

Obviously aiming to replicate the success of the 1996 original,mayhem-Meister Roland Emmerich raises the ante for more of the landmark-obliterating escapism.The dearth of original script ideas is shown more clearly than ever in this unnecessary sequel.Notably absent from the movie is Will Smith,who launched his career with hs turn as a gung-ho pilot in the original.Jessie Usher strives to live up to his fathers reputation of his dad,who was killed in an earlier skirmish.With the exception of the ever-reliable Jeff Goldblum,the performances are uniformally upstaged by the pyrotechnics.An underwhelming spectacle,I Day 2 doesn't even qualify as dumb fun.Curiously it has been released prior to America's independence day.Go figure.

We were waiting for Roland Emmerich's comeback and had reasons to have high expectations regarding this sequel to 1996s Independence Day – ID4.There are some interesting ideas, but the story and the screenplay are not developed enough and they're drowned in CGIs (SFX were more convincing two decades ago in a way...).This should have been treated as a dramatic story in a serious way, with tragic elements. Unfortunately, the dramatic structure contains (way) too much comic relief, making it a "funny movie" instead of what it could have been.Finally, the concept art is beautiful (congratulations on the great work!), but a little bit too much has been "borrowed" from Alien/H.R. Giger ARTS, without crediting Master Giger ;-) Roland Emmerich is no Ridley Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher, Jean-Pierre Jeunet or Neill Blomkamp, too bad!Rating: 6 (out of 12), 50%

Actually, I ended up enjoying this more than I did the original movie, probably because the main reason I saw the original was to see the aliens blew up New York and Los Angeles. However what I didn't like about the original film was that it seemed, at least at the end, to be little more than a copy of Star Wars. However, this is not a review of the original but rather a review of the sequel. Mind you, I was a little apprehensive, first of all because I didn't think much of the original, and secondly I remember that the lines to the first movie were huge. Well, it turn out not the be the case in both regards.The film is set twenty years after the invasion, the world is at peace (well, sort of, since there are still pockets where the inhabitants are ferociously independent), and the technology has advanced significantly thanks to all of the space ships that had crashed on the Earth. However, when the mothership was destroyed a signal was sent out into space to alert the queen of a clear and present danger – Earth. If they had managed to defeat the initial wave then no doubt they were going to be a threat. However Earth knew that such a threat was there so they went about building a defence system to could effectively deal with the alien's return. The catch is that it things never happen the same the second time around.Like the original film, this film focus around a couple of groups, including some characters that have returned from the original film (with the exception of Will Smith). Obviously they are all twenty years older, and some of them are starting to have dreams of this alien ship. When it arrives the general consensus is that it is hostile, so they shoot it down. However, then the actual hostile ship arrives, and it is so big that it literally covers the top half of the Northern Hemisphere. Also, they seem to have learnt from their previous mistakes in that they simply don't appear with all guns blazing but use a lot more strategy.What I thought was cool was how more of the aliens appeared, especially the Queen (though the aliens still look as if they had been borrowed from the Alien franchise). In fact the grand finale is basically one huge battle with the queen. Mind you, the film did take a bit to pick up, and it seemed to drag a bit at the beginning. Also the main characters (and there were a number of them) did seem to be a bit stereotypical, such as the fly-boy who was sent to the moon because he was a little too reckless, the kid that passed the academy with top marks, and of course the son of the hero from the first movie, who happens to have inherited his fame from his father.So, while the film did take a bit to start up, by the end it had really picked up the pace. I wouldn't call it an edge of your seat thriller – it's a sci-fi movie – but it is quite enjoyable, especially if you are looking for a dose of science-fiction to tie over your day.

I found the feature immensely exciting,the 3d screening has been awesome and realistic,the movie is visually great.However, a movie with this massive set, could have done an hour or half more, too many things happen too fast and it all felt being hurried.Back in 96, it was when it showed our first contact has been hostile and a delve into d unknown seemed very exciting. But here in 16,everything is a revelation as the entire universe of ID4 takes a step in the right direction.Visual details has been futuristic and meticulous, plot details however are.. .....loosely put. This movie won't burst us into emotions or wants us to apply for a fighter pilot like it did in the last, but i felt significantly happy for the story it told in pictures.Times have changed in 20 yrs, so our expectations... was a kid back then, a grown up now.... the ID4 universe also has expanded likewise.The movie had its own lighter moments too.However movie runtime should have been the biggest of all...... it does make people glued to the seat......maybe so many low ratings come since it left viewers wanting for more.But still its immensely appreciated.... nice work.

Roland Emmerich returns for his first sequel with pretty much the same team that brought us the first invasion with Dean Devlin again writing the script for this sequel, which he original threw in the bin shortly after the success of the first. Well, I can't imagine how bad that script was to be binned if this was the winning formula. Susan Sarandon turned it down because it was uninteresting and didn't make sense. I think there was a lot of over excitement from the film makers on this one that isn't appreciated by many. Very much like the first it's super clichéd but the first was forgivable with this one being annoying and defies all probable outcomes. We have more chance of aliens attacking Earth than bumping into your Dad, driving a school bus across the salt plains after your recent trip to the moon and back. There's plenty of plot-holes and things that just don't make sense. It's out of scale in both size and time. There's blatant inconsistencies which makes me think they rushed it, carelessly. Bill Pullman's president goes from being a crippling wreck with walking stick to being clean shaven and walking bolt upright. Their attempt to cleverly twist the story was so poor and silly lending to an inevitable trilogy. Again, it all happens so quickly, and what is that thing? Possibly designed to look like an Apple product? Wall-E already done that. It's rushed and hashed together losing the dramatic awe of the first film. It lacks the impressive action and the dogfights feel more like a messy rework of eighties video-games. I seriously have seen better fights from dated cartoons than in this. There's really nothing to shout about this, nothing we haven't seen before. People die, key people die but no-one really cares, there's absolutely no emotional investment where there's suppose to be. The sets feel cheap, and might have something to do with the U.S. Military retracting their assistant of allowing them to film on bases. And you might expect more from CGI powerhouse Emmerich, but it's just not believable. Not all of the FX are bad, but I'm surprised how little devastation a mothership did, especially being the size of the Atlantic Ocean. Yes, it picks up one city and drops it on another, but that's it. I'm pretty sure I saw the matrix coding on one of their consoles. Five of the original cast return, namely Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Star Trek's Data, David Spiner. Liam Hemsworth heads up being a pilot hot shot and feels like he should be Top Gun II. Emmerich's regular, Harald Kloser takes over from David Arnold for the score and it lacks a recognised theme and soon gets lost among the action scenes. It's not bad because they killed off Will Smith's character without any explanation. May have been a better twist having Liam Hemsworth character being the cause of his death instead of wing clipping the step-son. It's just bad, tasteless and dumb. The real reason for the death of Captain Hiller is the $50 million price tag that came attached to the high flyer. It's just larger and sillier, not as good as the first but, kids of today might just love it and talk about this one for years. Especially for when we take the fight to them! Overall it's very weak and a poor show from someone who likes to blow landmarks up, only thing blown up was the size of things. What is good to come from this is that I have been inspired to write a blog on alien invasions. Watch this 'space' for more.

We've had 20 years to prepareso have they. It's a tag line that has rang through the theaters for the last year and this weekend the bad, intergalactic, space bugs from 1996 have returned with a vengeance. Hi Robbie K here, and today we review yet another summer sequel entitled Independence Day: Resurgence. As always, I'm here to share my thoughts, ideas, and opinions to inform whether this sequel is a success or a flop. Let's get started. The GOOD:  Action scenes better animated  Original cast rocks the screen  ComedyBack in 1996, I remember being wowed by the "state-of-the-art" graphics the first installment brought in. Watching the planes take on the big bad pod ships used to have me on the edge of my seat and cheering in delight. Well twenty years gave us plenty of time to prepare better special effects and the battles are an even better display of computer processing power. The new combat ships fly much smoother, the explosions are much bigger, and the laser blasts are even more multicolored on the big screen. While the art design is a little hokey at points, the visuals are geared towards more exciting action moments, hoping to bring more detail to yet another 3-D showing. It's flashy and over the top to say the least, but it certainly lives up to what the trailer promised. But even better for this critic was seeing the characters from 20 years back in the seat. The original cast (for the most part) made up the quality parts of the movie. Jeff Goldblum dives right back into his character bringing both satirical comedy with serious "science" to try and save our cans again. Bill Pullman as the president also carries the same, over zealous, patriotic spirit that united our world to fight against the menace from the sky. But it was Brent Spiner as Dr. Okun (the crazy haired anatomy who supposedly died in the first film) whose roll I mostly enjoyed. The original cast just brought the nostalgia back to me and helped keep me grounded in the ridiculous plot unfolding. The new characters weren't bad mind you, and the younger cast has a promising future, but their characters were more sex appeal than anything else. Yet the thing that was most entertaining in this filmwas the comedy. I know, not what you expect right, but Independence Day 2 brought more comedic punch than anything else. Spiner's character is like something out of the Big Bang where curiosity, obsession, and nerdiness are unleashed with a Sheldon Cooper presentation. The quirky one-liners, extremely silly drama, and slapstick humor was indeed entertaining for me, albeit distracting from the goal of the film. There are plenty of other pot shot comments and moments through the film involving unnecessary tangents (like sailors getting drunk) to impromptu parenting that are all there to relieve the "tension" that was built up. The BAD  Not as suspenseful  Lacks emotional punch/connection  The Story for Pete's sakeIndependence Day 2's weaknesses start with the lack of suspense. I remember in the first movie being scared stiff as the clock ticked away to some unknown move by the creatures, or in that terrifying alien surgery scene. But in this movienothing of the sort happened. This usually is the case when 3-D computer visuals are the focus, and ID2 is another example of flashy special effects diluting the suspense they meant to bring. But the suspense is not the only thing lacking in this movie. Again in the first film, I remember being sad or angry when characters were eliminated (poor Jimmy). You felt the punch in the gut, but scream/cry out in frustration. This film didn't even come close to that for me. Key characters, who we had little time to get acquainted with, were lost in the most rushed ways that you didn't have time to process the emotions before being whisked to another flashy display. Oh well, who needs emotion in a science fiction right? That seems to be the thought these days.Perhaps the thing that robbed the movie of all these qualities though was the ridiculous story of ID2. I know the first installment was not the most realistic, and had plenty of plot holes and cheesiness to meet your fill. However, this sequel took all that and amplified ten fold. The plot essentially had too much it tried to accomplish, trying to make everything bigger, badder, and bolder while still trying to capture the nostalgia. In my opinion, they put too much emphasis on the bigger aspect, making the giant ship ridiculously giant to cover the entire Atlantic is just one example of the over the top antics that failed to deliver. They might have been able to deliver on the threat, but I feel they tried to jam too much into the film that they failed to bring any strong plot to the mix. And they way they ended, I shudder to think of how cornier the next installment is going to be. The Verdict:Surprise, surprise, Independence Day Resurgence is not quite the sequel we were hoping it would be. The over the top grandiosity and rushed pace fail to deliver a semi decent plot, and the comedy, while enjoyable, only further dilutes from taking this film seriously. While the visuals are certainly the strongest aspect, and the original characters breathe some life into the blandness, they took too much emphasis in my opinion. And that endinga rushed, convenient sweep up that robbed me of any satisfaction whatsoever. Based on this review you can guess that the only redeeming quality for a theater visit is the special effects. This reviewer however, encourages you to wait for this to hit home. Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 7.0 (for the action) Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0

Just saw this last night. This is one of the most terribly disappointing movies of the 2016 summer (if not any year) that I have seen. Rambling, aimless scenes just kind of strung together; little to no character development; certain important characters killed off with little or no fanfare. I could go on. The worst part is it has none of the excitement or fun of the original. I found myself not caring one lick whether or not the humans survived.Making this doubly disappointing was that I got to be an extra during the filming in Albuquerque. (I actually got about a second of screen time!) and so was really "pumped" about it from both that and my "behind the scenes" experience. The "flavor" of what we filmed was completely absent from the final product. I'm not sure if Roland Emmerich himself is necessarily to blame. The scenes were filmed to make this a really exciting sequel. Something (continuity, suspense, story development) was definitely lost in the editing.Wait for this one on home video, folks. It's a stinker.

Pure cringe is what Independence Day : Resurgence had me thinking during it's entire showing, whilst I do have an appreciation for good special effects and the scale of destruction in this movie was insane and somewhat mind boggling, I just can't help but feel cheated of the money I spent to see this in the cinema. It all felt far too familiar, like every other alien invasion, America- centric apocalypse movie that's ever existed, with ridiculous dialogue between characters, unbearable American patriotism and situations so unbelievable; they had my eyes hurting from how far they'd rolled to the back of my head.This movie was just a load of cringe-worthy one liners, implausible situations and clichés crammed into a 2 hour movie. Unless you like occasional impressive special effects and don't mind a flat story with no charm, don't bother going to see this one. If you want a good movie of this sort of cinema niche, go watch the first Independence Day, it at least, didn't make me want to stand up and leave mid-showing.

Star Trek + Top Gun + Aliens + Back to the Future + AI = this mess. Yes all of these movies might be good on their own. However, if you take them all and mash them all together it is kind of like taking a bunch of ingredients in your kitchen and putting it in the blender and hope it works. Spoiler alert...it doesn't. I now have more respect for Will Smith for not reprising his role in this movie. Clearly he read the script and said thanks, but no thanks. The only redeeming feature is that it does have some cool explosions to break up the cheesy one liners and bad acting.The end sets it up for a sequel and our only hope is that the real aliens come to earth and wipe us all out before that comes to fruition.

I have been a huge fan of Roland Emmerich. I grew up watching his movies. I have waited ages for this Independence Day: Resurgence as i have liked the original a lot and I am so happy to see it finally coming out so does it lived to my expectations? Let's see. First of all I have enjoyed this movie and i don't care what others have to say. May be it is not as good as the original but there is something in this movie which is more sinister than the original.I thought alien queen is the best thing about this movie.She is something which we have not witnessed in the original.The plot do have loopholes and low in destruction compared to Emmerich's previous movies but it is not boring at all. The movie will keep you engaged till the very end.All the actors have done justice to their given roles.Overall if you have liked the original then you won't be disappointed watching this flick. But do watch it in the theater. A visual treat.

'Independence Day: Resurgence' is the latest film in the recent spate of 'revival' sequels, being released 20 years after the original. The first thing that comes to my mind is: Why? Indeed, most of these types of film are unnecessary and ultimately disappointing; they are certainly not as good as the originals, even if they are pretty good on their own right. This film is no different. I never really loved the first 'Independence Day', finding it very cheesy and generally messy, so this film didn't 'disappoint' me as such. It's basically more of the same, despite having a slightly different plot and a few new characters. It isn't bad, but is certainly not great. It's simply alright: enjoyable enough to watch, but never anything more; it isn't memorable and isn't new, but it is fairly fun and I wasn't begging for it to be over.The film has it's fair share of issues, many of which also plagued the original. The first problem is the over-abundance of characters. There are both returning cast members (most notably Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman) and some new additions such as Liam Hemsworth, Jessie T. Usher and Maika Monroe. The returning members are pretty good, and capture the spirit of their characters accurately, but the new additions are honestly a little boring. Their performances aren't bad, but they aren't doing anything new or interesting - all three of the new leads just feel as though they are playing themselves. Something that bugged me was that they killed off Will Smith's character prior to the start of this film, as he didn't want to - or just couldn't - reprise his role, but kept Judd Hirsch's character alive; he was the one returning character that could have been left out, perhaps not even mentioned, without anyone blinking an eye. On top of this, the death written for Smith's character was very anti-climactic and it didn't have an impact on the film at all: they could have developed Jessie T. Usher's character a lot more by using this event, which would have made him more rounded and relatable, but they just didn't. There's also too many side-characters. Most of these people add nothing to the plot, and just serve to extend the length of the film. A couple of them are given way too much screen-time, as the filmmakers clearly think that they are funnier than they actually are; they started to annoy me after a while. The film just keeps cutting back to them and I didn't care about them at all. As such, the movie feels very unstructured and overly chaotic.This extends to the action, too. The CGI isn't bad, in fact it is pretty convincing at times, but it is relied upon too heavily. I only spotted one brief practical effect (there may have been more I didn't notice.) It ends up feeling like a mess, with so many CG elements on screen at once that it is hard to follow the action. It doesn't feel completely intangible and is generally fun, but it does look kind of implausible or unrealistic; there's just something a little off about it. The script is not great either, with a lot of on-the-nose and corny dialogue, and it insists upon telling you everything - even when it is being, or has just been, shown on screen. This is most prevalent in a very expositional speech towards the beginning that basically serves to fill you in on what's happened since the first film, which feels very clunky and unneeded (as the things described are being shown on-screen, in many cases.) The movie also relies heavily on coincidences, making a lot of what happens feel all the more unlikely and unconnected. The final issue I have is the fact that a lot of things don't make sense. Most of these are very little and generally inconsequential, but there are a couple of bigger plot holes.There are some good things here, though. The best part of the entire film is Jeff Goldblum. He gives the best performance, looks as though he is really having fun and is also the most interesting character. I wish that the film focused more on him, as his humour and mannerisms are very entertaining: everyone loves a bit of Goldblum, don't they? Without him, the film would have had to rely on the new cast of characters and would have suffered greatly as a result. Another good thing about it is that it's pretty fun, in a 'don't think about it' kind of way. It starts to get better leading up to and during the final act. Here, you start to accept it's absurd nature and the film focuses upon actually battling with the aliens. During this time, the side- characters are mostly side-lined making for a more streamlined segment. It also raises the stakes somewhat with a more unique plot device, and features an enjoyable climactic dog-fight. The final act is only soured by the ending, which is a very on-the-nose attempt to set up a sequel film - one that sounds even more preposterous than this one.Overall, 'Independence Day: Resurgence' isn't a good or bad film, it's just alright. I was reasonably entertained throughout the picture, though it fluctuates from being poor to amusing all too often. Some of the characters are annoying, the CGI is a little messy and the whole film feels rather unnecessary - not to mention it is very similar to the first film. I liked several parts of it, and never wished it would be over, but ultimately it is both unmemorable and mostly disposable: 4/10

I was so exited to watch Resurgence since my dad told me about it. When I found out about half of the original cast members were reprising their roles, the excitement tripled. But as I walked out of that movie theater, I was little underwhelmed. Perhaps I just need to watch it another time to fully grasp it.Given, it was a little disappointing to find that Will Smith would not be returning, whatever the reason may have been. But it begs the question on what role would his character have had, had he still been included? Did his absence force the death of Dylan's mom, or was that going to happen either way (to have that understanding between him and Jake)? How much of the script would have changed had he been included? However, I appreciated that they had written his character off in such a way that didn't seem forced, so to speak.Furthermore, the movie was cliché-galore! There was so much of "if we do this, then we'll defeat them for sure" happening that I began to wonder when the actual movie would end. It might have just been me, and I know that's the road most end-of-the-world movies take, but it seemed a little excessive. Yes, the obvious resolutions would have been even more cliché and we would've been deprived of more action sequences, but in return, we got some considerably corny overkill, IMO.The overall movie was pretty okay. It did a great job at setting up the next installment, unlike what BvS: Dawn of Justice had attempted (and failed) to do. I quite enjoyed the graphics and the score. The main cast showed their excellent skills with acting, except for the president and some of the COs; I feel like they were portrayed as "trying too hard."

This is a bit of Transformers meets Alien meets Real Steel meets Godzilla meets Avatar. Aliens (who resemble the ones from Alien and Howard the Duck) emerge from beneath the ocean surface to attack coastal cities, and humans develop giant robots manned by two pilots to bring them down. After a defeat early on by our hero, played by Charlie Hunnam, this robot program faces elimination. And a rogue captain tracks down Hunnam (who's taken a civilian job) and attempts to save Hong Kong using the last of the robots. Hunnam wishes to team with a young Japanese woman, whom the captain cares for, but she has difficulty overcoming the emotions left over from the killing of her family during an alien attack.I saw this from the front row, and the 3D was excellent. I really felt as though I were going to get wet or hit with debris. The visual effects and look of the movie were excellent. Some of the charterization and script are problematic. The two scientists at the base are pencil necked, squeaky voiced comic relief characters and it's hard to tell if they're giving bad performances or the script just demanded that they act like cartoons. The soldiers, especially Hunnam, try so hard to be macho it's almost funny. He's concentrating so hard on looking butch, he forgets to act and his accent fades in and out. Nonetheless, I think if he becomes less self conscious about his acting, he could be a big star. He has a bit of a Brad Pitt look about him. The Japanese woman is a bit of a weak character. The audience is supposed to giggle as she coos around Charlie, and I suppose some people might think it's sexist that the only major woman in the movie is portrayed most of the time as being too emotional to be a pilot. Obviously, most people aren't going to a movie like this for the script and compelling characters. I compared it to Transformers above, but only because of the robots. One great thing is that I can always tell who's who, where the action is happening, and what the stakes are. In Transformers, action scenes go on for forty minutes and we aren't clear who's attacking who. There are some clichés during attack scenes, with bits of obvious humor thrown in. But generally I think this movie will win over most people. Definitely don't wait to see it on video. See it 3D in the theater if this title interests you at all.

We all carry a great sense of wonder. It seems to hide away as we get older, but was always strong and persistent when we were children. We could sit down and really make something out of nothing physical, or tip our toy-box all over the floor and just go mad. Pacific Rim is Guillermo Del Toro at his most unleashed. He's been given the toys for his sandpit and has gone completely bonkers, but he has also created a sense of wonder from completely nothing.The plot is simple. Kaiju (monsters) from another dimension break through to ours and wage war on the planet and us humans must do what we can to stop them. So we build giant machines called Jaegers. General audiences are doing the worst thing by comparing this to Transformers or Battleship simply because of some simple image traits. Well I'm here to tell you that you're way off and also working comparisons in the wrong league. Del Toro has crafted an insane amalgamation of Sci-Fi, old-school thrills, special effects and brilliantly entertaining set pieces that all meld together in beautiful harmony, with just enough satisfying human moments and arcs that carry a nice balance of emotion and camp. It all blends well with the loopiness of it all. Its Guillermo Del Toro's trademarks turned up to 11, all while going nuts and having fun with his toys.There's just so much to love, that not even some minor pacing problems or a couple of sub-par performances can destroy the experience. Mainly its in the lesser background characters, but for me I'd say that Charlie Hunnam doesn't quite shine in the lead. He's certainly more than commendable, but he just doesn't break out here. Idris Elba steals the spotlight with a look and a bellowed delivery and its amusing to watch and Rinko Kikuchi has such an incredible skill with her mannerism and in her eyes, that's its a shock that she isn't in more films. Ron Perlman comes and goes and works his usual incredible moments.Pacific Rim is triumphant above the rest of the blockbuster herd. It knows what is missing from the norm and just goes crazy with it. Its a big, giant load of awesome fun. Prepare your jaw muscles, because you'll be smiling throughout.(Hint: Stay a couple of minutes into the end credits for an awesome additional scene)

As far as summer blockbusters go, 'Pacific Rim' has probably the most unabashedly uncomplicated premise - giant robots versus giant monsters. How much you enjoy Guillermo del Toro's robot-monster smackdown ultimately depends on whether you expect the movie to be any more than that. If you did, then you're probably going to walk away disappointed at how simplistic this apocalyptic spectacle will turn out to be; but if you're satisfied simply with watching huge-ass monsters and robots go up against each other, then you will enjoy every bit of this epic (and yes we do mean it literally).Indeed, the draw of del Toro's monster of a movie has always been to witness the monumental series of battles between massive lizard-like monsters (referred to in the movie by the Japanese word 'Kaiju' as a tribute to the science fiction films from the country which featured such giant beasts, e.g. Godzilla) and 25-story high robots (known as Jaegers, or 'hunters' in German) operated by humans. And in this regard, let us assure you that nothing in your expectation will prepare you for what del Toro has managed to accomplish on screen - not even comparing it to a 'Godzilla' meets 'Transformers' movie does it any justice.Let's start with the basics. First and foremost, the action is shot cleanly, meaning none of them shaky-cams nor extreme close-ups that diminish the scale on which it is unfolding. It is also coherent - thanks to some impressive work from del Toro regular Guillermo Navarro as cinematographer and John Gilroy and Peter Amundson as editors - rather than just a mashup of scenes that don't flow well into one another. We'll add one more before we start gushing - it is also beautifully choreographed, with just the right mix of medium and wide shots to place you right into the heart of the action.If that description above seems too clinical, then how about this - these setpieces are superb; in fact, they are worthy of every superlative that you can think of. Working on a gargantuan scale, del Toro executes the action with magnificence, whether the fleeting shots of the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge at the beginning or the more detailed sequences in the middle and at the end - in particular, a simply jaw-dropping one begins at sea just off the waters of Hong Kong and then continues seamlessly inland where both the port and the very city centre gets decimated by two Jaegers battling two Category 4 Kaijus.It isn't just about how colossal it gets; it is also the sheer mesmerising quality of the images, starting from the amazing level of detail of the Jaegers and the Kaijus. Even though it seems to be raining a little too conveniently every time one of these battles happens out at sea, there's no denying just how real and majestic each of them feels. On the other hand, the cityscapes are arresting in their neon hues, and the combination of the futuristic look with which del Toro paints these familiar cities with the bioluminescent appendages and venom of the Kaijus make for a particularly appealing visual palette.Now that we've finished with the savoury bits, it is only fair that we get to the (ahem) less than wieldy parts, which is in actual fact just about everything else we have yet to talk about. At first, the science- fiction mythology sounds rather intriguing - instead of coming from the skies, the threat to our planet came from a rift deep within the Pacific Ocean, a portal through which the Kaijus emerged and necessitated an equally massive response in the form of the Jaegers. Ditto the functioning of the Jaegers, which given their size, have to be operated by two pilots who sync up their minds via the neural handshake, otherwise known as the "drift".But del Toro and his fellow screenwriter Travis Beacham (who is also credited with this original story) uses these elements too mechanically. The rift is no more than an excuse for an underwater climax where the Jaegers aim to close the portal from which the Kaijus emerged, a resolution not quite different from that in 'The Avengers'. More significantly, the melding of minds isn't quite exploited for enough dramatic possibility, particularly given its significance in enabling our two lead pilots, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) to bond so seamlessly with each other.Equally clunky is the characterisation, which has as much poignancy as a piece of metal. Raleigh's scarred Jaeger pilot, still reeling at first from the death of his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff), heals too quickly for us to make much of an emotional connection. Mori's own traumatic near-death experience as a child that continues to haunt her also rings hollow and is equally quickly forgotten. Idris Elba plays his Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost in suitably macho fashion, but is largely one-note and engineered simply to deliver the rallying cries at suitable intervals - like the oft-heard "Today, we are cancelling the apocalypse" in the trailers.No thanks to the plotting and character issues, the pacing of the movie sags considerably after a prolonged prologue establishing the necessary backstory of the robots-versus-monsters war and Raleigh's own past. It only picks up at the halfway mark when the deep-sea monsters finally clash again with their mechanical counterparts, which will either be stimulating enough (if you're an adolescent fanboy) to make you wet your pants or leave you numb. Our opinion? It is del Toro's most ambitious, most imaginative and probably most groundbreaking movie ever, but we wish there were more of the warmth and character that have defined some of his best work.

I was lucky to catch an advance screening of Pacific Rim & I went into Pacific Rim excited, ready to see Giant Robots take on 3000 ton monsters & left completely satisfied. This movie turned out better than I expected, Pacific Rim is the best summer movie so far. The action delivers, whenever there's a kaiju/Jaeger fight scene you wont be able to take your eye's off the screen. Great visuals. Good plot. Solid acting. The character development is fair. Pacific Rim is overall a fun/good time movie that will bring out the inner 9 year in ya. If you're going into Pacific Rim expecting an Oscar worthy performance & plot, well sorry... Guillermo del Toro hit it out of the park with Pacific Rim & as I mentioned the visuals are great so definitely give this one a look at in 3D & if there's an iMAX near your area GO FOR IT! P.S stay for the after credits.

Let me get this out of the way - Pacific Rim is a massive let down. The film does little to capture the audience's attention, and uses every cliché in the book.Directed by Guillermo Del Toro, Pacific Rim is an action film which follows humanity's struggle to fight an aquatic dinosaur-like creatures which aim to take over Earth. In resistance, all nations join together to build 'Jagers' - or dual-piloted robots - to fight off the invasion. Pacific Rim's premise is really interesting. There's lots of room to explore the paroles of which humans have to work around to come out victorious. Unfortunately, the film doesn't do any exploration at all. On top of that, the script and acting are weak. The cinematography is confusing, and the film builds no anticipation. No one will remember this in two months' time. PROS + Soundtrack + Ron Perlman + Good 3DNEUTRALS ~ No plot holes (because there isn't really a plot)CONS - Underused settings - Length - Flatlined story - Weak script - Heavily clichéd - Unnecessarily violent - Unnecessary characters - Unlikable characters - 'Dual/Mimicking Pilots' are often out of sync. SCORE 4/10

Short and Sweet This isn't Romeo & Juliet, War & Peace or any Epic piece of fiction like those. It is a big budget smack-down. The battles in the cities around the world are pretty cool, but i would have enjoyed a more international flavors to it. But that's just my opinion. Transformers/Godzilla mash up, with shadows of Japanese robot fighting stories. The Jeagers (Robots) themselves have plenty to look at on the big screen, in some shots you get a good, if quick look at the mechanics inside, Sort of like the brilliant work done on the First live action Transformers movie.Characters are light and not completely original but what is nowadays? Good special effects and plenty of action.... a few nice non action character scenes to remind you of the stakes. Music is alright but not rousing. I give it 8/10

First of all, i've gotta say that when you go to watch a movie, you must have some sort of expectation about the movie that you're gonna watch. It's the thing that you expect, that you hope'll happened in that movie. I'll tell you what my expectation about this Pacific Rim movie. I expect that this movie will give me some sort of new view (since i'm a big fat fan of scifi, giant robots, and monsters) and combination of a post apocalyptic movie and monster attack. I expect a more advance CGI and special effect from the robots (it's called Jaeger) and all of the fight scenes with the monsters (it's called Kaiju), at least above transformers level, but on a bigger scale. And most important of all, i want some logical explanation of whatever happens, not just some nonsense that they threw away and patch it away with some cool graphics whatsoever (like in the 2012 movie). About the actors, now my expectation is towards the opposite direction, cause i don't intend to see some of great acting out of some (giant)monster vs(giant) robot movie, just a decent one is enough. Now if you go to see Pacific Rim in my set of expectation, you'll get what you want... well, more or less. Let's get to the downside first. The acting of almost all of the important cast were standard (some are below standard though). No special characteristic that will make them be remembered as all of them are replaceable (Except RonPerlman's unique appearance, though I don't really know his function in the first place). The plot graphics fluctuates up and down as the movie running as some scenes are making you sleepy, but another makes you unbelievably psyched (hint: the fisticuffs side). Talk about plot holes, at the beginning of the movie the logics are lined up pretty well. By the time the movie reached half time the plot holes seems to appear pretty often, though more or so its still edible. All of that thing aside, what makes Pacific Rim a great movie is the main reason that you watch it in the first place. Yes! Its the monsters and the robots. I gotta give a credit to Guilermo Del Toro, thus he's brave enough and willing to make this movie in the first place. To count that there's not that many movie with giant monster theme or giant robot theme (except maybe from Japan, which many of us are unfamiliar with), but to combine it into one clash is one of the most brilliant and brave idea ever come in Hollywood. Kaiju designs are of course not childish (comparing to Godzilla movies from Japan), as it is more chilling and frightening, since Del Toro's experience in making "monsters"is beyond perfection. Also the destruction caused by the monsters are illustrated nicely, as we are shown how the earth, cities, and its people are transformed, years after the attack. As for the Jaeger, they have a very excellent design, with various forms, and human pilots (remind us of the mobile suit in Gundam series, or the robot in the movie Robot Jox in the late 80's), a very unique concept which make a good response for the Kaiju attack in an intense, life risking fight. For conclusion, If you unsure whether to watch Pacific Rim of not, just remember that what you seek in this movie is not some sort of amazing Oscar acting, but rather a stress release movie about a post apocalyptic monster attack world, with cool giant robots battle. Maybe you'll love it for the most part if you're a fan-boy. Objectively... 6.5 stars out of 10.

Within the opening 15 or so minutes Charlie Hunnam's voice-over establishes the reality of a future where monsters (the Kaiju) repeatedly invade earth, to stem this humans have created giant robots (Jaegers) to combat them in increasingly badass iterations. This opening does a great job in conveying the scope of a film which is big, not just regular big, but like, Jason Biggs in 1999 bigg. entering the cinema from a world where these events rarely occur is initially a lot to throw at the audience, but it's handled so effectively and without tongue in cheek that it quickly becomes a world I had a blast experiencing. Maybe it was the incredible effects shots of robot related destruction used as a throwaway shots, but what I think really sold the opening sequence and the film as a whole is the enthusiasm Del Toro clearly has for the story he's telling.The cast is essentially a rogues gallery of TV's better dramas playing variations on roles they've nailed in the past (see: Elba, Hunnam and Klattenhoff) and some inspired casting of It's Always Sunny's Charlie Day who, as should be expected provides some effective comedic relief. Added onto this the score comes courtesy of Ramin Djawadi who's masterful use of themes on Game of Thrones is carried over to this film for some great emotional cues and many a rad motif courtesy of Tom Morello on guitar.It's appropriate Del Toro has a Frankenstein adaptation lined up as a follow up project as Pacific Rim can at times can feel stitched together from all the sources of inspiration the film has. This comes from many areas such as Japanese manga, the personalities of the actors from previous films and the imagery of robots destroying buildings which transformers ran into the ground. But Del Toro succeeds time and time again at allowing these disparate elements to fit together believably by way of some very confident filmmaking. I could easily take issue with the oft hammy dialogue and macho relationships but where the film succeeds in other areas and revels in creativity trumps the dissatisfaction one could take from these scenes. I also found Hunnams character a tad lacking in charisma and internal conflict but whatever, it's not the end of the world. Oh wait, yes it is hahahaha The films successes go beyond its imagery and continued invention within battle scenes as the script is very economical when it comes to pacing. The films battle scenes are so engaging and exciting due to clearly established stakes present which left me devoid of the "action fatigue" transformers loves to throw my way. And although the Kaiju battles seem to never be in short supply, the film essentially follows the rule of three when it comes to battle sequences and left me oh so satisfied.In conclusion, I give it points for being one of the funner summer blockbusters in recent memory, for being an original property and for its sheer tenacity to exist which all amount to what is just a darn good time at the movies.

I was so ready not to like "Pacific Rim". It seemed just like another one of those "giant robot movies that are just all noise and nothing else. Fortunately though, it was a good thing that it was the only movie beginning when I got to the mall this morning. This is so much better than the "Transformers" clone I was afraid it would be."Pacific Rim" takes place in the year 2020 (not really in the very far future, isn't it?) and the world is under attack from gigantic monsters coming from ocean depths called Kaiju. As the tag line tells us, "to fight the monsters, we created monsters of our own." These are in the form of so-called giant mechanical fighting soldiers called Jaegers, controlled by the skills of human controllers. The human team dedicated to fighting these destructive creatures are based in Hong Kong. The soldiers were all hot-headed and macho heroic types, led by Stacker (Idris Elba). The scientists were portrayed as nerdy and caricature-ish comic relief, led by Dr. Newton (Charlie Day). The central character is Raleigh Becket, who previously retired from the Jaegers when his brother and partner died in battle. He was portrayed by Charlie Hunnam, who was not too familiar to me, just another generic blonde Hollywood hunk. The face could have been interchangeable with any of the other Caucasian fighters in there. The lead female character is Mako Mori, an aspiring Jaeger fighter, with a painful past. She is portrayed by Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi, who we should remember was nominated for Best Supporting Actress back in 2006 for her role in "Babel". Here, she appeared to be confused on how to properly portray her role, so she did not come across too strongly as her character should have beenDespite these casting and characterization flaws though, the movie as a whole still turned out very well. Director Guillermo del Toro faced such a challenge to execute a script that dangerously flirted with disaster, deriving obvious comparisons with, not only "Transformers," but also "Godzilla", "Real Steel", "Armageddon". He succeeded to create within this borrowed material enough heart to make audiences root for the good guys and care if they save the day or not. When I was watching as the movie went along, it did matter too much anymore that the acting was not too good, or that the scenes looked familiar, or that the lines get corny. The movie was actually engrossing and entertaining. The special effects were of epic proportions. The whole thing worked as a whole, and that is what matters in the end.

Man builds 200-foot robots to fight gigantic monsters emerging from a rift at the bottom of the ocean.I think this movie may be good for a 16-year-old or younger boy. Otherwise, the stupidity of the story and weaknesses in the acting take you too much out of the action.From the trailer, I was waiting to be disappointed by why it takes two people to control one robot. Turns out, the neural connection between the machine and man would overload the mind of one brain. Fine. Here's a better solution: nobody gets in the thing and a team of people operate it remotely. Look, I know the point is the show lots of action, but why start off with this silly contrivance? Sure, it's supposed to set-up for powerful emotions when one robot "pilot" gets his partner torn from right next to him, but there could have been better ways to create this situation. It could be pilot, co-pilot. Or navigator and weapons.Then, are robots really the best way to fight these monsters? They say even bombs and missiles are ineffective, yet some of the robots have missiles and other traditional weapons built as part of their arsenal. Either they are or they're not effective. Make up your mind.But, I get it. It's all an excuse to watch big robots box big monsters. Fine. But, the fight scenes generally disappoint. Technically the film is fine, but viscerally, I just wasn't there with our heroes during most the battles. There were moments in the Hong Kong fight scene, but even that didn't maintain its occasional high levels of excitement.And the acting was mediocre and made worse by what I guess was poor directing and a lame script. The only memorable line is when one pilot says to his brother as they're about to do battle, "Don't get cocky." That was awesome in "Star Wars." Here, it just made me think of how much I'd rather be watching that movie.The character traits that are supposed to make us care are so shoved in and over the top that it never truly connects to us on an emotional level. Yes, it's sibling pilot teams, and father-son pilot teams. But, just saying they're related and share a bond doesn't make us feel that connection. And so many characters are so cliché and overacted it's as if they're in a B-movie. It is a popcorn flick, but at its budget and pedigree, I expect more from the performances.Finally, perhaps the most distracting part of the film is its score. The movie's music pretty much consists of one theme six notes long repeated and used throughout the movie. I started cringing each time I heard those same six notes (actually, three notes played forward then backward).This film makes Michael Bay look like Orson Welles and "Transformers" the full-color "Citizen Kane" of robot movies.

*9 / 10 This first thing that came into my mind when I watched the trailer is that this movie is like Mobile Suit Gundam. Yeah, that anime. Unless that the robot is controlled by two pilots. The robots here are called "Jaeger". Then the monsters. Godzilla's friends? Ultraman's new nemesis? They call the monsters "Kaiju".I have great expectation in this movie. Guillermo del Toro is a director with lots of experience and I don't think that this movie will go wrong or mocked by the audience. Not only as director, he also wrote the screenplay! We know that Guillermo del Toro is not just a director, he is also a writer, sometimes as producer, too. We all know that his Hellboy movies are awesome so this Pacific Rim should be entertaining.The movie's prologue told us about the Kaiju attack all around the world. Then the human race built giant robots to fight the Kaiju to save the world. Then the main characters were introduced one by one. Their past, their characters, and their craziness. The storyline is set in perfect proportion and perfect order. No character's story is too short or too long. We know that Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) is the main character but everyone got their screen time equally.And, uh, a bit applause for the budget. This awesome movie's budget is "only" US $180,000,000! I don't believe that, actually. The special effect is awesome. This is what I call "Sci-Fi magic"! Awesome shot, and the scene when Gypsy Danger sliced the Kaiju's wings above the Earth's atmosphere was so stunning. I cannot erase that scene from my mind. My gosh that scene was really awesome, and more stunning than any scene in James Cameron's Avatar (2009). That. Scene.Many said that this movie is quite similar as Transformers. Nope. It's not same at all. Transformers are basically aliens and these Jaegers were artificially made by humans, and had pilots. The concept is like playing Wii or Kinect games, like a simulator. The pilots controlled the Jaegers by moving around and also lots of buttons that I don't understand.The drama thing in here is also good. The sad moment when Stacker (Idris Elba) said goodbye to Mako (Rinko Kikuchi), also Herc (Max Martini) and Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky)'s last encounter. Those scenes almost bring me to tears. The only hilarious character in this movie is Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman), and Dr. Newton (Charlie Day), maybe. Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) is another extra point to this movie. He's smart but, like typical smart people in movies; he is also stubborn but in the end he could accept another people's opinion.To conclude all of the things above, this movie is really worth watched. This is not just a gigantic robots movie. The storyline, the action, the special effects, the concept and the execution are balanced one to another. Pacific Rim is the black horse in summer movies so far.

If you enjoy seeing giant robots battle enormous monsters from another dimension in stunning 3D you will absolutely love Pacific Rim. With its theme of world-wide devastation from a seemingly unstoppable invasion of colossal beasts, the fate of humanity rests on the shoulders of Jaeger pilots - individuals who jointly control and pilot gigantic robots. A rift in dimensions has opened between dimensions in the pacific, known as the Breach, where giant monsters named Kaiju emerge to ravage the sea-side. Over the next five years war takes its toll on humanity and in response to this grave threat all the worlds' governments pour all their resources into finding a way to stop them from destroying the world. Jaegars are created, enormous twin-manned robots with the power to fight and kill these mysterious alien giants. As the frequency of these attacks increase and the resources of the Jaegar programs funds slowly diminish, a final answer must be found in order to save humanity from a seemingly devastating end.What really got to me was the mood of the film. There is a general sense of doom and finality to the encroaching, and ever escalating frequency of attacks from the beasts, which are referred to as "Kaiju", a Japanese word which literally translates to "strange beast." Famous Kaiju from cinema history include "Godzilla", "Mothra" and the enormous turtle-like monster "Gamera." Fans of these types of films are in for a treat.While some might criticize the film for being unrealistic in its plot, you have to remember that these kinds of films are never to be taken seriously. The drama involved in Pacific Rim, I felt, was handled with subtlety, with the usual tropes that come with action films of this caliber. So expect to see rivalries, old warhorses, a badass bookworm played by Charlie Day, and of course the battle couple played by Charlie Hunnam and Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi. Of course the actor who really steals the show is the star of BBC's Luther, Idris Elba, who plays Stacker Pentecost - Director and driving force behind the Jaegar program. A man with a seemingly impossible task ahead of him, he must remain strong for the sake of the pilots under his care and supervision.A generally fun and engaging action film with plenty of amazing visual effects. The designs of the aliens leave one in awe of their sheer scale and destructive power. The immense size of both the robots and aliens is felt as you can really sense how heavy they would be. The animators really did a splendid job on this film. I can appreciate this film from a technical standpoint alone. Legendary Pictures have outdone themselves and produced an original film outside of their usual comfort zone i.e. superhero films. We can look forward to Legendary building on their giant monster film experience with "Godzilla" set to release in 2014 through Warner Bros. Entertainment, after which Legendary are rumored to be signing a new contract with Universal Pictures - with the expiration of their Warner Bros. contract at the end of 2014.

I was so excited to finally see Pacific Rim. An ambitious idea, carried with big-budget effects, brought to you by master director Guillermo del Toro. I was pumped. I was hoping for brilliance, something to truly give other blockbusters a run for their money. The result, as I had to expect, was not that of a game changing event. Instead, it was more or less, directly in between Greatness and Disappointment. There's a lot to love about Pacific Rim, but where it suffers seems to be mostly through a lack of confidence in it's own premise.Like last years Les Miserables, Rim makes the unfortunate error of trying to fit in 3-4 hours worth of storytelling into just over 2. Which is unfortunate considering Pacific Rim's all round story is it's strongest element. Though taken from many sources, (and by no means, anything that original) it shapes a very well-throughout premise with detail and conviction. In it's execution of this however, is where the film stumbles. Mainly, the plot feels rushed. Condensing years of devastation and development, into one short montage (the first five minutes of the film covers the entire ark which Pacific Rim is built on: the first encounters of the Kaiju, the initial attempts to stop them and finally, the culmination of the Jaguar program) which contains enough story to fill an entire other movie. The intro then concludes with the untimely destruction of one of, what seemed to be, the human race's final salvation. From there is where the movie actually begins. Now while that's an interesting (somewhat ballsy) approach, this structure causes Rim to feel much smaller in scope than what it actually is. This story is HUGE as a concept and it should have translated that way. Unfortunately what is shown is both giant in scale and unjustly short. The film is set over a small amount of time, considering the attacks have been going on for years and though it covers many key events in the Kaiju war, it never really feels like you've been delivered the full picture.Now, on the positive side, if you focus your attention to what is on display, Pacific Rim excels. It flows with both confidence and conviction. Expecting a lot from the maker of Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2, del Toro delivers with a lot of what made him great (even if you're mostly getting del Toro, the action director). The design of both Jeagar and Kaiju are brutal and majestic. The world in which Rim exists is one where any previous del Toro film could fit in with comfortably. Beautiful design. As well as that, being this is del Toro's first real entry into mega blockbuster territory (Hellboy 2 was big, but nothing close to this) there was initial concerns that maybe he would be out of his depths in bringing the all-out-brawls to the big screen. Luckily, he delivers there too.The Jaguar vs. Kaiju assaults are stellar, even if they're not the defining assault on your senses you were hoping for. When the standoffs begin, you are returned to your childhood, reminded of why you loved seeing things go bomb in the first place. It's big, it's exciting, it's unpredictable (well, some what) and it's just so must fun. Delivered, also, with a sense of peril for the characters, which is arguably the most important thing when creating great action. Which, for that, requires a group of characters to which you need to feel like giving a damn about.Though things have been said about the people of Rim, I found them to be well-rounded and developed. Though not reaching the arks of previous big-screen franchises (The Avengers, The Dark Knight), everyone is given enough to go with, to at least earn the right for us to care about them. The standout being Mako Mori played by Rinko Kikuchi who holds the stand-out scene of the movie, when she first steps foot inside the cockpit and co-pilots the Gypsy Danger... While on the other side of the hemisphere, Charlie Hunnam, taking leading position, brings the usual tough guy, stands-for-everything-right solider, with a delicacy that makes it feel more realistic than movie realistic. Supporting casts deliver also, with the always great Idris Elba doing well with a small role, while Charlie Day is much less annoying than what you may have previously anticipated and is convincing as the fumbling, genius scientist. And of course the always fun to watch Ron Perlman as shady, black market dealer Hannibal Chau. If you take Pacific Rim as a great action/adventure story you will find much to appreciate in it's delivery. Though, were it to have the self-confidence to deliver it's premise with more conviction and pacing, it could have been the best action film of the year. For what is on display however, there is very little to hate. Guillermo del Toro has done an exceptional job at bringing this mammoth concept to the big screen and delivering in, close to the way I had hoped. In the end, what you're left with is a great, thrilling experience that confirms that big robots fighting big monsters is actually a great idea for a movie.

Pacific Rim is the most ambitious project undertaken by Guillermo del Toro at this point in his career. I'm a huge fan of his work. Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy films are among my personal favorites. Anime fanatics who are familiar with Neon Genesis Evangelion will be quick to notice the striking resemblance to some of the "mecha" (giant robots) featured in the movie, but the similarity ends there. Although the majority of big-budgeted Hollywood movies that have been released over the years were derived from comic books, classic cartoons or novels with a solid fan base, this film is a cut above the rest. Del Toro took a risk and created his own version of "Transformers" far relieved from Michael Bay's commercial-like robots and in all honesty,he just might give him a run for his money. In a not-so-distant future where giant beasts or "Kaiju" wreak havoc in major cities across the globe, our only fighting chance of defeating these creatures is through the Jaeger Program. The giant robots aptly called "Jaeger" are driven by two pilots where it's controlled simultaneously by melding their minds through a neural bridge. I'm not going into further detail but they completely redefined what "drifting" means. Other countries have joined the Jaeger Program including China, Russia and Japan but Australia's Striker Eureka and USA's Gypsy Danger were given more screen time. The intense battle scenes between the Jaegers and several types of Kaiju are almost surreal. I don't even know why they have to reboot "Godzilla" when this film just showed us several versions of his ilk. There was one particular scene when the Kaiju decided to take off with his bat-inspired wings and Gypsy Danger have no other choice but to shift into Voltron-mode wielding an enormous sword while suspended in outer space ( I guess they're trying to pay tribute to the classic Japanese anime).Charlie Hunnam was the perfect choice to play Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger pilot with a rebellious streak and the film's main protagonist. Becket's new co-pilot Mako Mori portrayed by Rinko Kikuchi played her part well despite her English sounding more like Japanese. However, she compensated for it with her remarkable Kendo fighting skills. Idris Elba who played Stacker Pentecost,leader of the Jaeger program delivered his part exceptionally well and steals every scene he's in. Even "Hellboy" star Ron Perlman had a small role as Hannibal Chau, a black market dealer for everything Kaiju-related. The remaining cast did what was expected from their respective roles. There's so much visual feast in this movie to revel in for fans of the genre and for the average moviegoer looking for a more satisfying cinematic experience. After watching a plethora of blockbuster movies in IMAX 3D, I have to say Pacific Rim is a standalone film that will captivate you from start to finish.

First off, Del Toro is a visual director,that is fact.In this movie he steps into a level all his own. At face level this movie was a Mech versus monster movie and that's what it is. The underlying stories are not bad,they aren't done as well as they perhaps should have. The underlying story may not come out as effectively as some people may expect but that does not distract from the overall fun factor. This movie has a good level of comic relief especially from Ron Perlmans' character. There are some pretty strong characters too, Idis Elba for example is his usual brilliant self as stacker and Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chow is genuinely funny. Overall this is a very good action film, if you appreciate action, give up an hour and a half or so of your time and you won't be disappointed.

I'll keep the review short. This movie has all of the things required to make a big fun summer movie. I can give you two reason why you should watch this movie in the big screen. Robots and monsters. Robots beating the crap out of monsters and vice versa is something you don't see a lot in movies these days. Guillermo Del Toro really did bring the best of both worlds from Japanese monsters and from the robots. Visual effects here are awesome and I recommend seeing it in 3D cause it really shows more depth to the visualization. The only thing that bothered me in the movie is the two scientists. They're pretty annoying and when they need to tell something important and I couldn't really understand what they're saying. All in all you need to see this now and this movie has a lot of potential for a trilogy.

I had great expectations for this movie based primarily on the fact that Guillermo del Toro was in charge. While his influence is obvious in that the visuals and design are impressive, there is nothing new here in terms of the plot or script. Anyone who has seen The Avengers, Cloverfield, Godzilla and Real Steel has basically seen this movie's main ideas on screen already, all of them are combined in Pacific Rim but in this case the whole is a lot less than the sum of this parts. I watched this in IMAX and the visual effects were well suited to the format, however, the destruction of cities and fights with giant robots are not enough to carry the film. Idris Elba does an admirable job with a limited script but the remainder of the characters are as clichéd as they come with the two academics, Gottlieb and Newton, being particularly irritating.While I give this a score of 4 stars these are for the visual effects and not the jaded, threadbare plot.

I have been following this movie for a while now. Largely because of the two main actors Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba and I have to say I was not disappointed at all. Watched it in 3D (I have always strayed away from 3D before because I just didn't think it was worth spending the extra cash) but this time I do not regret my choice at all. It was a visual feast.Action was on point. The story flowed well (this is a blockbuster after all, we aren't going to compare it to an art house film). For me the actors embraced their roles very well and the visuals were magnificent (thank god once again for the 3D). Everything just felt right!Being familiar with Guillermo's past work I would say this is his best yet. His imagination is wicked. So if you are looking for great entertainment and a little something to wow you, this is the movie for you. Bravo. Two thumbs up.

after watching Pacific Rim premiere in theatre actually the premise of the movie is pretty much the cliché one...a world apocalypse. what was made it different from another American film is the concept of "giant robot" with similar synchronization control with a certain famous japan robot animation and the Japanese concept of big monster vs big robot.the graphic, the robot , the action is in the top tier. i can't argue that this film is the orgasm drug for robot and machine hardcore fans and geek, it delivers the mean of showing you enjoyable action with giant robot who punch and got punched with big monster named "Kaiju".although it has a awesome CG action, and actually a good storyline....., but it's a shame that this film still has some wasted potential in it. the setting of the world, some characterization (especially at another pilot), tension building, useless character and, the prolonged flashback, and some wasted scene, are still in it and with a shame...this film get a "C" Point for the first, second and third factor.anyway it's the film which better watched with 3D for the impact, because the story didn't really have any twist and surprise in it...... and the tension in top of that.give it a score 7/10

"The Pacific line" is very pleased with me as a summer blockbuster. Similar premiere last year only disappointing at best just left a good impression. Recall the "Battleship" with a great start and sunken finale. "Oblivion" was worthy of a fantasy, but without claiming to be religious. I can not believe that the script for the "turn of the Pacific" was written by Travis Beacham, who also labored over the "Battle of the Titans", where the actual battle of the titans I never saw. I saw a real battle today, where huge robots fighting with monstrous monsters from a parallel universe. That's really the scale!From the first frame of the movie is steeped in history which began the extermination of humanity. There are no mysteries with a spectacular appearance in "Godzilla." All at once simple and clear. Elaborate figures as monsters and robots are staggering. Contractions are varied and unpredictable. The brain is not overloaded due to blurred shots when the huge devastation. Highly developed and detailed interiors, detailed drawing of the robot-rangers. From the point of view of all the pictures are just perfect.Also, the story does not disappoint. In principle, most of the predictable, but Guillermo del Toro tried to make the audience does not get bored while watching. That was it. Really looks the same breath. The acting for the sci-fi movie with a plot very worthy.Music sets the mood for epic. You feel the imminent end of humanity. In general, an adequate response to the recent zombie apocalypse.8 out of 10P.S. Most worried about the Japanese girl with the red shoes.

Just got back from an opening day screening of Pacific Rim and to begin with i have to say i was satisfied with what i saw. This movie is arguably the movie that i have been anticipating most for this year (maybe even more than Man of Steel of Iron Man 3), for the fact that this is totally some fresh idea in Hollywood for a long while. Now to the movie itself, in terms of action, it was totally satisfying and even more than that. It started right off with a Kaiju and Jaeger battle that more than delivered, and subsequently, more fights came on with increasing level of awesomeness, and well paced out so it does not make us ask ourselves when are all these fighting gonna end? (hint: Transformers 3). Guillermo del Toro certainly is good in coming up with fresh and dope ideas, like the plasma cannon and having the Typhoon with 3 arms and turning bodies. It was totally unexpected ways of fighting from the Jaeger that made me very happy, rather than just the punch and kick and shoot rockets like i imagined before going into the theater. Action wise, i rated this higher than the Transformers franchise (with part 1 arguably an exception), and Battleship or Godzilla. Special mention to the IMAX version, if you don't mind paying the extra, then go for the IMAX, it will be crazy :) In terms of heart, this movie certainly did delivered as well. The director said himself the movie is about humans, and it certainly was. With all the awesome fighting mentioned, i still felt that it was only an icing to the cake, rather a bonus to a well shown relationships between the Commander and Mako, as well as the father and son in Striker Eureka. It was the humans that made the Jaegers. At the end of the day, the film succeeded in making me believe that this is humanity fighting back, but not the robots. Now to the weaker part, i felt that some parts of the movie needed a bit more development, and also the movie will certainly do better with a better male lead. In the beginning of the 2nd act, they totally didn't brought me with why Becket has to return. I mean why didn't they come and find him in the 5 years in between? Next up, one line is all it takes to change his mind over such catastrophic incidents? Throughout the whole movie, i felt like Becket was just simply...there, he didn't shine, he didn't provide the sparks he could have. Idris Alba and Rinko did a better job for me, it was believable display from them. All in all, if you go in the theater wanting for some pure entertainment to relieve stress, and maybe a bit of smile on your face over the heart of the story, Pacific Rim is perfect for this weekend.

Only one word can describe Pacific Rim, and that is "Wow!". It got everything I need in a robot vs monster movie except one thing, which otherwise would make it a perfect movie.The movie got huge robots and huge monsters (that's obvious). It got great CGI, great robot vs monster fighting sequences, a surprisingly quite good story (which should be expected in a Guillermo del Toro movie, but which I didn't expect much at first in this kind of movie), rocket punch, Portal game's GlaDOS voice, and it even got (borrowing the term from Voltus V anime) the "Tenkuu ken"! How awesome it is! But, as I said before, it is missing something. Something very important.== Warning: this part may contain spoiler ==Because Guillermo himself said that he wanted to "honor" the kaiju and mecha genres (while creating an original stand-alone film), and because he also said (in one of the promotional featurette videos) that he was influenced by Japanese big robot anime of his time like "Tetsujin 28", and also because one of the promotional posters featured a Japanese jaeger called "Coyote Tango", the absence of a Japanese jaeger really bothers me. I would give this movie a perfect ten stars if it shows even one sequence of a Japanese robot kicking a kaiju's ass, and not just featuring one Tokyo scene and two Japanese actresses. I personally think that Guillermo should at least give a nod to Japanese mecha anime genre. But no, Coyote Tango was not in the movie, so I take out two stars out of this movie.

"Pacific Rim" is a highly explosive, exhilarating, exuberant, energetic, and exciting hell of a ride. When I saw the trailers, I knew the action sequences would be massive in scale, but the film just blew me away because the scale was just incredibly enormous. Every action sequence in this film was just mind-blowing. Unlike "Transformers", this movie has a real sensible plot. Giant monsters (known as Kaijus) are the extraterrestrial beings that are currently ravaging Earth. However, they don't come from above the atmosphere, instead they come from beneath us. A portal in the bottom of the ocean serves as the method of transport these Kaijus use to reach us. These Kaijus are arriving one by one, and as they do, they increase in size. They're so massive in size (I reckon they're bigger than Godzilla) and the amount of destruction they cause is just indescribable. But the humans don't stand around doing nothing. They build their own monsters, gigantic robots known as Jaegars, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked by a neural bridge. This allows them to synchronize their movements. However, despite these mighty Jaegers, the seemingly bright future for the humans turn dim as they begin to lose the war against the Kaijus. All of this was clearly covered in the prologue, quickly but properly. Now that seems like a basic plot, but I can tell you that there's actually more than that and the story is deeper than it looks from the outside. "Pacific Rim" provides sensible explanations for the phenomenons that occurred in the film. Now I'm not a genius or a scientist, but the explanation is logical. The characters. Our protagonist is Raleigh Becket. He's had a bad time after his partner and older brother Yancy died in a battle against a Kaiju before. But he's recruited by Marshal Stacker Pentecost to pilot one of the four remaining Jaegers. His new partner is Mako Mori, a Japanese girl who wants to be a pilot to avenge the death of her family. Becket's and Mori's Jaeger is the American-made Gypsy Heart. The cast behind the characters were great too. Charlie Hunnam was terrific as Raleigh. Idris Elba gave a commanding performance as Stacker. Rinko Kikuchi rocked as Mako Mori. The chemistry between Hunnam and Kikuchi was excellent too. But I have to give special credit to Ron Perlman (who previously played in del Toro's "Hellboy" films) as the black marketeer Hannibal Chau who makes a living by dealing with Kaiju organs. He has style and charisma. I also loved Burn Gorman and Charlie Day as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb and Dr. Newton Geizler, respectively. Their chemistry was absolutely perfect and these two were just amazing. The visual effects were undoubtedly incredible. Everything was mind-blowing and the gigantic scale of the action sequences allows you to be fully immersed into the scene. And the sets were extremely magnificent and glorious. I did not feel any sense of boredom when I was watching this film. Even the drama scenes were enjoyable too. The scenes where explanations were uncovered were exciting too and the music is a prominent part of this. Guillermo del Toro also did a great job in his directing because I gradually became supportive of the Jaegers and every time they fought, I rooted for them to win. I became immersed into the movie. Every time a Jaeger was in trouble, I was rooting for them to get back up and fight back again. I wanted them to smash the Kaijus to pieces. "Pacific Rim" is just simply awesome. Now, it may not be for everyone, but if you love action, giant monsters, and giant robots, you'll definitely love this. Or if you're just trying to have some fun, watch this. It's got both brains and brawn. Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: "Pacific Rim" is an amazing and explosive ride that is plenty of fun to watch, accompanied with dazzling visuals and a coherent plot.

Pacific Rim takes inspiration from the elements of any material that involves giant creatures and robots. It shows a simple concept about piloted robots, Jaegers, fighting against sea aliens, Kaijus. This idea alone would already make a fantastic blockbuster. The surprise we get is it features more than just endless explosions. There are plenty of innovations to root for which it can almost be a new popular classic. The only less intriguing parts however are the clichés that are too known in many big sci-fi action movies. Despite of that, it kept the promise of being gigantically awesome. It's not completely groundbreaking, but it's still quite an experience.Aside from the large scale battles, the film amazingly creates an innovating futuristic alternate universe. It tells the origins of the Kaijus and how the Jaegers work, shows what society and the media have become, and throw some satires of the genre. The exploration of the vision is so absorbing, it feels like you went to it as a trip. But what somewhat halts this from being larger than life is when it takes the generic elements of any typical blockbuster, like the hero's motivations, the main robot is somehow an underdog in one scene, there's an arrogant team member, sacrifices, and so on. It's hard to not notice them since they are the central points of the story. The intriguing stuff about the Jaegers and Kaijus still took over the experience. At least it embraces its own fantasy tastes without being "dark" and emo like today's blockbuster trend.Charlie Hunnam's performance is fitting to a graphic novel based movie, which is kind of appropriate as his role. In the battle scenes, he gives genuine human emotions as he punches and fall. Idris Elba remarkably brings heart to the picture while being awesome at the same time. Rinko Kikuchi makes her character more than just a partner of Raleigh. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman delightfully serves more energy to the story, while Ron Perlman appears in a short screen time but satisfying enough.Now the real highlight of the picture, the visuals are overall shiny and snazzy. The designs of the creatures and robots are palpably marvelous. As the special effects move these heavy giants, the action did something better than just blowing up stuff. Although explosions and loud noises are not actually flaws(It's about giant robots, c'mon!), but a real good set piece needs a decent and genuine fortitude. In the midst of the noises, you will always get the sense of danger to the Jaegers, mostly because there are human pilots beneath the ravaging machines. It effectively made those sequences electrifying and the monsters terrifying than you would expect.Pacific Rim will have its own fans. It feels like a self-indulged blockbuster that people will end up loving. Besides, this film is said to be Guillermo del Toro's dream come true coming from his childhood. And seeing all that, there's plenty of things to explore and to be intrigued. If only the plot can break some points from the mainstream storytelling, it would have been less predictable and much extraordinary. But physically, it is extraordinary. It's both big and eye candy which is the snazziest merit you will see. Also in the action scenes where it's more into the thrills than the fireworks, because it's all about iron fists hitting on monsters' face. Again, the story may be familiar, but the setting and the action keeps everything looks fresh and amazing.

I saw this on Tuesday and had little expectations. I suppose the best comparison I could make is the same expectations that I had with Battleship, except more depth (because it was directed by Del Toros).I found the characters clichéd and wafer thin. I found a lot of dialogue equally clichéd and corny. The special effects were superb, but a lot of the fight scenes were in the dark and (particularly in the sea) I found it hard to follow fights.I also found the humour a little bit thrown together (as opposed to being part of the story). In the original transformers movie, I think it had a charming humour that made it more fun then this movie.I didn't care for the characters (in fact, by far the best character only had a few mins on screen time) and the actor I really looked forward to didn't really have a character I enjoyed or cared about (and his speech about the apocalypse wasn't really that inspiring).I gave it 6/10 because despite these flaws it passed the time away and I didn't come out hating it. I just felt it could of been so much more. Its unfair to compare a directors previous movies that are completely different, but Del Toros can tell good stories, create brilliant worlds and have lovable characters. I felt this movie was really lacking in story and character.

How do you make the perfect summer movie? I'm not just talking about the best action movie, or the best summer comedy, just the perfect summer movie. Some would say lots of explosions, while others may say a good love story will always do the trick. Every year all the studios aim to release a movie that you will want to see, their idea of that great summer movie. Well I think Guillermo del Toro has figured it out, Robots Vs. Monsters.I know it can't be that simple, since we already had a Cowboys and Aliens that didn't live up to expectations, but for me "Pacific Rim" really is. We have always looked to the stars for where we thought visitors might arrive on our planet one day. But, what if they come from deep within our oceans? That is the question "Pacific Rim" poses. Creatures called "Kaiju" have attacked the coastal cities in the Pacific. They start in San Francisco, and then attack cities like Manila, and Cabo. After conventional weapons have little effect, the world's governments decide the only way to fight monsters, is to build monsters of their own. The "Jaeger Program" is born, where giant robots are built to fight for mankind. Each Jaeger is controlled by two pilots, who control each hemisphere in the Jaeger. The Jaegers become mankind's best weapon against the "Kaiju" and their only way to save the planet. This is what "Transformers" could have been, if del Toro had been at the helm instead of Michael Bay. While Bay has always been a visual director, he just does not have the complete package like del Toro. This movie has something for everyone, but above all it is just fun to watch. It is a big and loud, and one of those movies that are made to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. For everything that is wrong with summer movies like "After Earth" and "The Lone Ranger" this movie gets it right. This is not a movie that is going to get praised for its great story, even though it has a decent one. The main selling point is "come see this movie and you get to see giant robots and monsters beat the crap out of each other." I mean really after that what more do you need? I went in expecting to see one of the best movies of the summer and walked out not thinking any different. The performances for the most part are not anything special, except for every time Idris Elba is on the screen. Given the best dialogue, including a speech any football coach would love, Elba just commands your attention. In a world where sequels rule, we should embrace originally. I mean didn't we say all we needed to say with the original "Grown Ups"? Do we really need another? I say this weekend when you go to the movies see "Pacific Rim". It's like sequels are the "Kaiju" and this is your chance to command a Jaeger and to tell the world you are tired of all the "Kaiju". And if you can, see it 'IMAX' big, because this movie doesn't do anything small.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/

I have never taken the time to write a review, but on this occasion I feel a duty to other movie goers who may read some of the glowing reviews of this movie here and wonder if they are watching another movie and been duped.I have been an avid sci-fi, space, alien, etc fan for 30+ years and I've watched a LOT of movies, some good some not so good.This movie was weak in acting, storyline and plot. Americans doing Australian accents and Aussies doing American accents.. Seriously. It was groan worthy with some of the bad acting and clichés and had us watching the time for when this travesty would be ended and we could leave. We even debated getting up and walking out with 40 mins to go. Sure it had some nice cg effects but overall this is a cheap rental movie at best.I implore you, do NOT waste your money and time at the cinema no matter what these other reviews are having you believe.

Words could not describe how excited I was for Pacific Rim. Yes, it was a blockbuster about giant robots fighting giant monsters, but between Del Toro directing and all the early praise it was receiving from critics and filmmakers alike I went into the early screening extremely giddy. I'm sorry to say I didn't leave the theatre with the same enthusiasm.In 2013 a wormhole known as "The Breach" connected our world with another, letting monsters known as "Kaiju" invade earth. Millions of people were killed and entire cities were levelled After years of defeat in the war against the Kaiju the governments of the world joined together and developed "Jaegers", giant fighting robots sort of Mighty Morphing Power Rangers meets Gundam. We pick up in the year 2025 with the Jaeger program failing as bigger and deadlier Kaiju are coming out of the Breach. With not much time left the governments call together the last of the Jaegers for one last final showdown in Hong Kong.I really wanted to like this movie. In fact I wanted to love it but I didn't. For the opening 30 minutes I was really into it, the quick news flash wrap up of the Kaijus first landing and the invention of Jaegers led me to believe this movie was going in a different direction than the trailer showed and I deeply wanted it to. Since there was so much praise for this film, there had to be more to it, right?There wasn't. Everything plot-wise was given away in the trailer. The only thing that trailer didn't show was the bad dialogue and over-the-top acting (arguable). There is lots of intentional comedy, which worked fine, but the rest was the bad kind of cheesy; the kind where you can't tell if they made a mistake or not. While I'm sure people are going to tell me it was intentional I can't say that it being intentional really makes it better in this case. I'm a huge fan of that meta/self-aware style but only when they use it to say something, to drive their theme or message home and I can assure you the overall message in Pacific Rim was not driven forward by ironic poorly delivered dialogue.Despite the overall negative tone of this review I actually ended up having plenty of fun with the film and I will say that it is an awesome monster movie. The overall production was quite a marvel to watch. The visuals are breathtaking and the soundtrack/sound design compliments the visuals masterfully. There is no doubt that Del Toro has left his visual signature all over this film. The soundtrack wasn't a bunch of dubstep noises either, which was one of my only concerns going into the film originally. There was actual score and it built up the emotion of the scenes better than most of the actors did. I would say that this film is highly enjoyable,as long as you don't go in expecting more - which I will admit is difficult if you've read any early discussions on the film.I put most of the blame on myself. I'm sure if I didn't hype this movie, and didn't read all the early praises I would have had a much better time with it. That's why I'm giving this film a decent rating, since I firmly believe it's my fault for not being in the right state of mind. The way people were reacting made me expect that this would be more than the trailer, more depth to it, you know? Pacific Rim is a stunning mindless action film, but in the end that's all it is; a mindless action film. I guess it's my fault for expecting more.I can't stress how much I wanted to love this film enough. I REALLY love Guillermo's work however this just didn't do it for me. I'm sure this movie will find its audience and I'm also sure my review will get ripped apart by his fans. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing it again in a different mindset. I think I'll like it more the second time. Our Rating: 7.0/10Let me know on Twitter @thejoshl what you thought of Pacific Rim!More reviews at themoviebloggers.com.

I just got home from seeing Pacific Rim, and I have to say that it was a pretty good movie. It wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't a disappointment either. As expected, the special effects were stunning. I thought the robots were extremely well done and looked really awesome. The fight scenes with the monsters were also exceptional. Even if the monsters look similar to other movies (Cloverfield) they were still visually appealing. The plot was straightforward as one would expect, and it had few twists. However, a movie of this kind is not expected to have a superior plot full of surprises. Pacific Rim is meant to provide the viewers with 2+ hours of pure entertainment, which I can say it did.I did have a problem with some of the movie being cliché. I won't give any specifics, but some of the parts have been seen in countless other movies. In my opinion, though, the interesting concept and special effects more than made up for the platitudes. I thought the acting was solid but not exceptional. Rinko Kikuchi bothered me a little bit, but I think it was her character rather than her who I disliked. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies or end-of-the- world films. It obviously won't win an Oscar, but it accomplished what it set out to do.I'd give it a 8/10.

Just watched the film last night before the actual premiere. And the opening scene was just purely sick! There was a voice-over dialog but the action was fast-paced and direct to the point. I predicted there would be a "failed-mission" type of part that will happen for the main character to rise from his past.The movie also had short human action scenes in the soldiers' training but it was also a good one. What I liked most was that the Jaegers and Kaijus were superbly and realistically designed. I was shaking at the edge of my seat because of the intense battle scenes. There were also some kind of a twist, but not really a major change-up on the flow of the movie but I literally shouted "WHOOOA!!!" inside the cinema. Good thing the music volume was also rising that time.Too bad the Gypsy Danger was the only one emphasized of its abilities in action but the other robots in the different posters were, well, lesser in exposure. But it was good enough though. I recommend everyone should watch this. It's very, very, worth it. But you should be prepared for the 50,000 tons of madness action that you will never, ever forget.I give this one a shining 10/10

I just watched Pacific Rim on the first day/time slot of premiere in 3D. Yes, I am a geek. But that is not the whole point. If you had the excitement of watching anime movies of robots vs monsters in childhood, this is perfect movie for you. The Kaiju monsters design reminds me of Godzilla's villain monsters combined with Cloverfield monster, xenomorph (Aliens), and TRON. As for the Jeager robots, I'll let you to decide whether they are good or very good. :)To watch this movie I needed to change my mindset to be like a 10 ten year old robot geek child, like 29 years ago. Because if not, you will feel a lot of question marks and disappointment through this movie. The story is quite predictable. The plot and pace are simple enough for children to understand. And the nerd and geek professor appearances are a bit annoying for me. But hey, that what is all about: to celebrate the childhood memory of robots vs monsters.Overall, the movie is great for robot vs monsters anime fans. It's not even close to that horrible Michael Bay's Transformers.

I don't know what to say actually but lets say "AMAZING EXPERIENCE" on this movie. I love a battle to save the world. This movie is kicked ass. I wish I can see another series like this, but this time it would be more robots from around the world, as well as stronger story. I want to watch it again because this movie was too fast to understand right away. I need to watch it again so that I going to like it more. As far as no; story, fights, and the robots are not enough. I need more. The idea of this movie was really good. Bring out all the nostalgic when we were a kid and watching the "Power Ranger" with a giant robots etc. So, maybe that is the only "kick" of this movie so far. Please release the director's cut for this movie!! And I wish it will be a better one.

I literally could not stop myself from writing this review. There's  just so much to talk about, I don't know where to begin...but let's  just get this out of the way...  PACIFIC RIM IS A 5 OUT OF FREAKIN' 5.  Guillermo Del Toro, you deserve a standing ovation. From an unbiased,  stand-alone movie point of view, this film does an incredible job of  being exciting from beginning to end, while still developing an awesome  back story and character depth.   Charlie Hunnan (of Sons of Anarchy fame) solidifies himself as a good,  respectable action movie star, but Idris Elba CRUSHES his role, and  steals every scene he's in. Solid acting all-around, much better than  what you might expect from an action movie like this.   THE ACTION IS TOP-OF-THE-LINE. What is there to compare this  to...Transformers? Transformers WISHES IT COULD HOLD A CANDLE TO  PACIFIC RIM WHEN IT COMES TO EPIC-CGI-ACTION SEQUENCES. Every hit,  every explosion, every gut-wrenching Kaiju kill is a work of art. A new  gold standard has been set.  VISUALS AND GRAPHICS ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD. THIS MOVIE DESERVES THE  IMAX 3D TREATMENT. THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE PART OF YOUR BLU-RAY  COLLECTION. THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE VIEWED ON 9 BIG-SCREEN TVS  STACKED ON YOUR LIVING ROOM WALL. Do not cheat yourself by simply doing  2D on this one.   OK, now the nerd-out part of this review. If you are a nerd in any way,  shape or form, then this movie is for you. And if you're an anime nerd,  then this is your favorite movie ever. EVER.  The inspirations from and references to Godzilla are obvious, but  you're very likely to notice influences from several different sources.  Anime fan? Then I dare you to not see the nods to Big O, Neon Genesis  Evangelion, Gundam, or even Gurren Lagaan. That female computer voice  sound familiar? Maybe that's because it's the voice actress of GLaDoS,  from the motherf*cking Portal games. Your inner nerd won't know what to  freak out over more.  5 out of 5, gold star, thumbs up, A++, 100%, NOW STOP READING THIS AND  GO SEE IT!!!

Saw the movie yesterday evening and I must say, going in with minimal expectations, these expectations were fully met.. I was pretty disappointed...The story is paper thin (although built up nicely) and the performances of the actors flat as a pancake.Perhaps I am still holding on to my childhood years when I saw movies like Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, Never Ending Story and never been so engulfed in a movie ever since. But the Rim was a movie I just couldn't get into at all. Yes, the special effects were great and all that, but it just didn't reach me and tug the ol' heart strings. No goose bumps like when watching the first Iron Man and no perplexed amazement like watching The Matrix for the first time.All in all..I want the 130 minutes of my life back I spent watching this movie..Harsh? You decide yourself when watching this movie..

One of summer's most anticipated movies is finally here, Del toro's Pacific Rim. This is a movie little boys imagine when they are young, playing in their sandbox. It's quite easy to see why Del Toro was attracted to such a film. It clearly shows in this film and I don't think many directors could handle a film such as this with such love and dedication to their craft. Del Toro really knows what audiences want. So is Pacific Rim his best film? No defiantly not, not even close. Is it at least a great film? No it's not. Pacific Rim however is entertainment at it's finest. It's difficult for me to rate a film like this . Pacific Rim has flaws. The human characters are pretty much awful, and the movie is cheesy as hell. I must also say 3 characters in this movie were probably some of the worst characters I have ever seen in a film. The main female, and the two scientists were just awful. However the real star of this film is the giant robots and the evil monsters. Del Toro knows how to entertain an audience and by god does he do it here. The action is fantastic and does not get to crazy like some Transformers movies do. This is the type of movie where you need to have your brain off and just be entertained. If you hate movies like this, then don't even bother checking this out, but if you have watched similar films and enjoyed them, then you will be all over this. Pacific Rim manages to be original and familiar at the same time. However because of Del Toro's fantastic direction and storytelling it's easy to overlook Pacific Rim's failures. This one redeems the mediocre summer films. Rating: on a film reviewers scale i would say 7.5 out of 10. However it's Del Toro i'm biased and above all rounding up to a solid 8 out of 10. Final Rating: 8 out of 10

This is my first time to watch Guillermo del Torro's directions experience on high-digital movies. Watching Pacific Rim is like watching Japanese's robotic movies, despite of its technical performances. The origin story is quite original, coming from ideas of monsters coming under our world, human world and the emergence of a hero, very big hero, to destroy them. On the view of technical performances, nothing but big, huge, and robotics. I can't imagine how genius is Guillermo del Torro to manage his art team. But that's great job! Viewers can feel the feel of being a monster itself, being a big creature. That's why I can't recommend this film on DVD. My last review touches the story and actors. The story is smooth-shocking viewers, but the ending is romantic, as always :) On this movie, we find some new coming actors, but within them, there are several action actors, so we can also watch some actions as defined on our imagination. Thank you Guillermo del Torro!

It is my sincere hope that this movie proves to be a huge hit, because that will mean we'll get more live-action anime adaptations from Hollywood! Why do I say this? Because Pacific Rim isn't a direct adaption of any one particle anime series, but rather, a homage to the entire genre as a whole. And all of this from the man who brought Hellboy to the big screen, no less! That said, the Human element in this was a little weak, the romance felt a little forced, and some characters felt too large for life. Case in point, in a movie that features 300ft robots and monsters duking it out and wrecking entire cities in their wake, the only element that felt really too excessive was Charlie Day's performance as the science fellow. The whole effect, ultimately, was the feeling of a comic book, but then again, this is exactly what the director intended, and exactly what we, the viewer, should expect. As you may have guessed by now, I'm a huge geek for anime, manga, kaiju films, and Japanese culture in general, so this movie was everything I could have wanted, and then some! That is why I encourage you all to check it out! In the mean time, I'll be biding my time until another Japanese monster star makes a well-earned and highly anticipated return to the big screen next year. Until then, this is ugyenpeljor signing out.

I can't say much about this movie that I wastefully just spent money on, except that it was visually pretty good. The story was written by a 5 year old. The Reasons plot lines happen in the movie was so that a cheap answer to them could be made with cool visual effects. So other than cgi, Its just cheap plain and simple. If I was 5 years old I would probably love it, but then again, I was pretty dumb then and had no idea of what the good writing of a story actually was. Sorry, I am very critical, but if you are going to spend millions making a movie, why would you spend ten dollars writing the story of it? Doesn't make sense to me.

I had certain expectations going into Pacific Rim – I just wanted to see giant robots (known as Jaeger in the movie) and giant monsters (known as Kaiju in the movie) fight. I wasn't going to mind if the characters were meaningless vessels solely to move the story along as long as the giant action scenes were done correctly, because that's what this movie is for. If I were to give you the plot of this movie I would tell you the only thing that matters is the action, and if you go into this movie with the same expectations as me, you're going to get exactly what you bargained for.Guillermo del Toro directs this film and he does a great job at making every single action scene seem huge. Every hit in the movie packs a punch, and a hard one at that. The Jaeger vs. Kaiju battles do not disappoint in the slightest and are helped hugely by the great special effects work. The CGI in the film is top notch and makes every high- octane scene that much more intense. Not to mention the sets that the actors are in inside of the Jaeger are practical. The fact that they took the time to build sets for the actors instead of just putting them in front of a green screen is something to appreciate, and adds to the film's realism.The Kaiju are so interesting to look at, from the effects work yes, but also out of the different designs of each one. Some of them walk, some swim, and some fly but they all look fantastic. Seriously, I couldn't help smiling seeing these things battle, it's everything the inner child in me could want. It's completely over the top, but everything in this movie is, right down to the script and acting.Charlie Hunnam stars as our main protagonist and, although not awful, he definitely wasn't anything memorable. Anyone could have played his character. There were only 2 standouts in this movie to me – Idris Elba and Charlie Day. Elba brought a presence of force and power that the movie obviously needs, but is also the most human out of all the mostly hollow characters. Also, that guy's mustache is awesome. Just look at that thing. If I had a list of favorite mustaches, his would be towards the top. But, in my opinion, Charlie Day steals the whole movie. Maybe it's just because I'm a fan of his, but I absolutely loved every time his character was on screen. He was hilarious, but he also served as an important part of the story. That being said, whenever the movie focused on any other characters it slowed down for me because I didn't care about them as much. Luckily, the two get a lot of screen time to balance it out.Honestly, there's not much more to say about Pacific Rim. The film follows up with exactly what it advertises – giant, incredible action. A more refined human element would have been appreciated (and if the movie had it, it would be phenomenal), but the movie is entertaining enough in its action to look past that. When it comes down to it, this movie is just a damn fun time.Pacific Rim - 4/5

Giant monster vs giant robot blockbuster movie? sounds that it will be somekind of a transformers movie. Wait... it's directed by Guillermo Del Toro? I should consider to watch this because this could be AWESOME. And my decision was right to watch this, money and time well spent, this movie is a lot of fun. The characters were good, the acting was also quite well done, and don't even ask about the action? It's Spectacular! Well actually to be honest some of the actors were kind of over the top, but that's actually quite make sense. The action was not like transformers, it's very much better. This comes from a director can actually frame the action up, unlike Michael Bay that just puts action and action and explosions and we don't even know what's happening in the movie because it's not well done. Don't even dare to compare this to Transformers, because comparing Pacific Rim to Transformers is like comparing Jurassic Park to Theodore Rex. One of the best things about the movie is it's not just action, the characters are also important and interesting in this movie. We do care about the characters. Only very few directors that can pull this kind of movie off, this just proves how good Guillermo Del Toro is, as a director.

I have been eagerly awaiting the release of Pacific Rim for many months, after being able to see it I can say that the movie was (surprise) fantastic. The fights were visually impressive, the sets were detailed and gritty, the costume designs were good, and the plot wasn't bad (which was what I was afraid of). The movie is very enjoyable, however I will say it did have some flaws that kept it from being the perfect movie I had hoped for. I will list the flaws first, so that way I can end my review with all of the positives.The Pacing: In all honestly this should've been two or three movies. The movie throws many concepts at the audience and yet it never goes fully in depth with any of them (save for a few that are vital to the plot). In one of the scenes a guy is being chased by a kaiju due to an experiment, however it isn't explained fully why the kaiju is chasing him. Another scene (spoiler) shows that one of the kaijus is pregnant. I was expecting that this would lead to capturing one of the babies (which was a goal that the main scientist wanted at the beginning) or possibly this would allow people to actually control a kaiju much like a jaeger. However the baby kaiju are used for nothing other than a little bit of comedy and as a plot device to add some tension.There are many things in this movie which would've been interesting if expanded on. I understand that this movie was kind of a risk, so I know that they couldn't make three movies, however there are a lot of ideas that are important to the plot, yet are only on screen for several minutes. Such as the after effects of being in The Drift alone. What are the side-effects? Why do they occur? What kind of emotional trauma can it do to a person? Other questions such as: how come the "coastal wall" is brought up so briefly and then it disappears very quickly? This movie is full of "unfinished" concepts. My last gripe about the pacing revolves around the extra pilots. The movie establishes that there were a lot of jaegers, and it shows a large cast of pilots. It would've been very interesting to have gotten to see each jaeger in action more and for character interaction with the other pilots. However, if the movie had all of the character interaction that I wanted then it would easily have been a 4 hour long movie.Clichés: I won't lie, this movie does have a bunch of clichés in it. Being cliché isn't always a bad thing, and this movie is actually able to use clichés to its advantage. For people who don't read mangas, watch anime, or watch old Godzilla movies; they probably won't understand that some of the irrational behavior of the characters are typical in mangas and anime. This gives the movie a sort of "real life anime" feeling which very few movies have ever been able to accomplish. Some people will see this as stupid, and others will enjoy it. I enjoyed it for the most part.The Positives: Visuals: This movie must be seen in 3D. I saw Avatar, How to Train Your Dragon, The Avengers and many other movies in 3D and this movie takes the grand prize for the best use of 3D I have ever seen. The movie is just simply gorgeous to look at, and it is obvious that a lot of work and talent went into making this movie look fantastic. The water effects are extremely realistic and everything IS JUST SO COOL TO WATCH!!! The very first battle was one of the most amazing fight scenes I have ever seen (I actually smiled in the movie theater during every fight scene... it is a very good looking movie).I will go on a little bit more about the visuals. The kaiju themselves are very well designed. Each one is unique from the others and seems to fill its own niche. Some have blades for a head, some fly, others are like giant gorillas etc. and each one is just as entertaining to watch as the next. The jaegers are very nice looking as well, however the movie doesn't spend as much time as I would've liked on the other jaegers. The Action: The flow of the action in this movie is good. This isn't just about how the visuals look in the action, but actually what is happening in the action. Transformers suffered from great visuals but uninteresting action. Fortunately, this movie succeeds in both great visuals and great action. All of the fights are clever, unique, and crazy awesome.The Acting: All of the actors did a great job in this movie, however I will say that sometimes the acting was a little bit over the top at times. I will mention (I said this earlier) that this movie appears to be more like an anime/comic in the sense of how the characters act. All of the acting is good, it just depends if you like what they are portraying or not. Another nice thing is that most of the actors here aren't extremely famous. I like seeing new faces on the screen.Verdict: Pacific Rim is an extremely entertaining movie that understands how to make good action and how to make a monster movie. All of the parts of the movie are very interesting, sadly the movie is just too short to be as good as it could be. If there was more character interaction, more struggles with the past, actual character development, and more expansion of the Pacific Rim universe; then this movie would've been perfect.Either way, go see Pacific Rim and enjoy the ride.

I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical at first but cant help to get excited upon seeing the first trailer. I have always been fan of Ultraman,Gundam,Kaiju movies and mecha animes.Non of it ever make it in a big screen but this is as close as it gets.Big big nasty monster..all of different kinds..one can fly like a bat..another like a crab..shark etc..the action is superb in my opinion..actions are raw as i like it..I like the scene where 3 jaeger vs 2 Kaiju in HK..sooo awesome.The acting is OK..the mind drif neuron connection was an interesting concept that added depth into the struggle..I will watch this again with no doubt..So far this is the only movie that didn't let me down after all the anticipation of a big summer blockbuster..iron man 3 was a meh for me..man of steel is just OK..but not this one..all the action n scenes..intact in my head..so much of boom boom pawww!!

The Good:Superb action (The best so far this year) and Groundbreaking VFX. The director, to his credit, makes awesome use of the technology available and makes us feel every Punch and blows traded between the scary kaijus and the *huge* jaegers (seriously, they make the transformers look like toys)Great acting by Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and of course, Ron PerlmanEpic background scoreThe Bad:The lead character is not that well portrayed and his motivations are weak and his arc is not given justice. The two scientist types are super annoyingThe movie is full of clichés, which really shouldn't have been the case For a movie which looks this good.In summary,Pacific Rim is better than the blockbusters which have released this year. It promises epic action, and delivers it in spades. But for those who are looking for something extra, it disappoints.Pacific Rim is by no means a bad movie, but it could have been so much better...7.5/10

Pacific Rim = 2 1/2 hours of my life I'll never get backUgh, Where do I begin on this crapfest? It was like combining Power Ranger MegaZords with Godzilla, while taking story points from Starship Troopers and Independence Day with the goal of destroying more CGI buildings than The Man Of Steel. In my theater I witnessed 5 people walk out at various points (who never returned) and it took a ton of willpower to continue to punish myself and sit through it till the very end. I have enjoyed every Guillermo Del Toro movie up until this point but everything about it just seemed rushed and sloppy.I give it 1/5 Voltron Cats (which doesn't really form Voltron now does it)

Long story short : The movie is only a pure fight between giants robots and giant monsters. I saw that there are many fans and child's watching this movie and sorry if I will be more critic as I am not a child.I see this like an Japanese anime implemented as a movie and that's it. Robots fights with giant monsters anime stories were mainly written for 5- 13 year old child's and they were pretty successful . I guess the target public for this movie is the same, as beside the actual fights the story line is flat , disappointing, with a lot of clichés and seems to be written for this age interval. Why ? You invest so much in special effects (fights are really good – the only thing I could enjoy) but so less in story scripts , and actors? Why bother to do amazing special effects (robots/monsters designs and fights) and rap them around with such stupid story? Aliens coming to colonize our planet through a portal. OK good ! They send clone giant monsters to destroy dominant habitant, and you defend with giant robots . Good so far, but why in the world is needed for the robots to be driven by 2 pilots – no sense at all? How in the world you can really convince the entire world to build a wall as it is better than some super giant robots – is the world really retard in this movie ? Why after so many years of fighting you have only 2 so called scientist studying the monsters and not an army of them (why in 2013 you need them fighting between them in theories – cliché )How in the hell you can get pregnant a giant cloned monster? (Why you use "the cocky guy staying with the back to the baby monster after throwing a knife and getting eaten after" cliché? )How did the pilots returned through portal without having monster DNA ?How can you get a super strong monster with real natural armor to get cut in half with sword .Yes the effect is amazing but put some physics in the equation , do some minor experiments (through a chicken into a knife and see how much speed or force is needed for it to be cut in 2 ). And it was longitudinal please  How can you really get exploded a super extra mega atomic bomb without having the damaged robot even move  and in this way there are many inconsistencies which I really did not appreciated for a 2013 mega production. Effect of the fights are really great but all other not. I really advice for the producer to have a real critic person working with him to have a before releasing feedback to improve the movie itself. I was really served with a sandwich of great and really bad, I was "UUU" great fights and effects , and soon after I was "WTF" , is this real ?

"Pacific Rim" is a spectacle for the eyes and ears. I mean this movie is a visual treat from well detailed robot and monster designs to high over the top, but well choreographed action sequences and massive collateral damage. The world that Guillermo del Toro creates is imaginative and his character designs are mesmerizing and complex. The sound design and the sheer force of the films score captivates you into a ride of sight and sound that pleases all your senses. From the metal grinding noise of the robots to the fleshy and almost beast like cry the monsters make, this film has you feeling like you are right there in the middle of the action.While the movie is mostly is a visual treat, it doesn't forget about its characters and there humanity. The film isn't all bells and whistles, it really does have some really nice character moments in its script, which are about overcoming fear, moving on and trust. These moments make us care for the events that are unfolding. However, the script isn't all serious business, it knows when to have fun. Some of these moments can be a bit too campy though and some of the emotional moments feel forced. The film sometimes even becomes contrived, mainly towards the end. However, director Guillermo del Toro balances things pretty well.The actors in this film do a pretty good job, but the only real standout is Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost.This character is sort of the leader of the resistance and Elba commands attention every second on screen. Charlie Hunnam is pretty good as Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger pilot, who left the resistance after a traumatic incident. I wish they showed more of his inner battle, it would have invested us into the story more. Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori is really hit or miss. The scenes where she is more reserved are good, but when she tries to emote, it can be awkward at times. The rest of the cast is pretty solid and the supporting cast is pretty good, especially Charlie Day, who brings some of the lighter moments to the film.Overall "Pacific Rim" as a giant robot versus giant monster movie is pretty awesome. The visuals, sound, and well directed action are all top-notch. They provide a treat for the eyes like never before. Even the 3D is spectacular, the best I've seen since "Avatar," it really absorbs you into del Toro's imaginative world. The story, mainly the human element, is a bit weaker as it can feel contrived at times. It keeps us involved, but never takes us to the next level of emotional satisfaction. I give it 4/5, a blockbuster with some of the coolest and most imaginative action that I have seen this year.

The Good: The action sequences was spectacular, I loved it!! The CGI was epic and not cheesy like World War Z! Guillermo Del Toro brought the Jaegers into the big screen with strength and action. The Kaijus looked awesome! The relationship between Raleigh and Mako. Hong Kong looked fantastic in this movie! The fighting between Jaegers and Kaijus in the ocean while it's raining. The storyline was something we haven't seen for a long time. It felt like a Japanese film with great action.The Bad: The characters needed more story. Not much to say...Go watch this film with your friends and have a great time!! Rating: 9.25/10

I saw trailers before and was hopeful.What I got was a knock-down awesome robot vs. monster movie. I wasn't looking for the next Transformers (though I really liked the first one, less with the dogs and teenage awkwardness and more with the robots), I wasn't looking for a Coppola/North best written screenplay like "Patton", I wasn't looking for a dramatic Oscar-winning performance of "English Patient" (which I fell-asleep in a few times because of boredom) I wasn't expecting great cinematography or musical score...but the graphics, CGI and music turned out to be effective and quite good.If you went (or will go) expecting the next cinematic masterpiece like "Dances with Wolves", or a classically written and well acted "Casablanca" you're going for the wrong reasons. This is Die Hard (1, not 5...5 was a disgrace to the Die Hard name), this is Rocky (again 1, or 2), this movie is a little Real Steel with more fighting, and monsters, but without all the cheesy crap.It was awesome! Thrilling and just a great remake (and a better make) of movie combo: classic cartoons and monster movies. If this movie had come out when I was a boy, 20 odd years ago, I probably would have seen it 10 times at the theater, bought the movie and then watched it at least once-a-week till I wore out the tape. It's not the wussy Power Ranger crap.The things I liked: Robots, monsters, robots and monsters fighting, technology. Big machines, big machine sounds. Big cool robots and big cool robot sounds smashing big gruesome, maniacal alien monsters hell-bent on destruction.****** Spoiler Alert ****** The plot, simple? Yes very. Often predictable outcomes. The acting was average. The writing didn't help the average acting.I saw it in a foreign country so I'm not sure if the audio was goofed but when Mako meets Raleigh her lips were speaking Japanese but audio was English and he answered in-kind and the only subtitles I got were in the foreign language (not Japanese or English). I don't know if that was intentional, you know the old Samurai movies where the actors were speaking Japanese but audio was English voice-overs. If so now that I think about it, it could be pretty funny.Please stop with all the "Battle Speeches" Idris did a great job in the movie overall but those last-stand battle speeches were finished in Braveheart (yes that was 1995).But I loved the Voltron-esque (or that era of genre robot movies) and Godzilla-esque references.

I walked into this movie not caring much about the plot or the characters (which as expected where extremely campy and/or cliché), all I wanted out of this film are bad ass fight scenes with robots beating the crap out of godzillaesque monsters.Did this film deliver, yes and no... Both the mech and monster designs were done really well; the mechs look as they should, i.e. giant towering pieces of metal and the monsters look like stuff that came out of Godzilla movies. The down side to the designs is that essentially all the monsters have the color palette of either grey or darker grey and it doesn't help that all the fights occur at night or during a storm...or underneath the ocean...while the mechs have a bit more color to them, they are killed off way too quickly leaving only the two protagonist mechs which as you guessed it...just so happen to be colored grey...The film does well to capture the sheer size of the monstrosities however, as a whole, combat was done poorly. The vast majority of action shots are either low angle, worm eye or close ups - sure it shows how brutal every punch or thrust is, however, at the same time - its hard to appreciate the fight choreography when a fist or horn takes up the majority of the screen.Overall, for a popcorn flick, its average. 5/10.

Awesome film. Definitely in my top 5 favorite movies of the year. The story as usual was very predictable but it was the awesome action and stunning visual graphics that really made this film work. Mr. Del Toro also does a great job in keeping this movie as family friendlyThe Jaegers however were one of my main concerns. There were not many involved there and it too much was focused on the 'Gipsy Danger' Storywise although simple and straight forward, there might some things in the story that are kind of hard to understand but again this is the kind of movie where action is more important. However, I think people will quickly get bored with this movie after a whileThe acting form Charlie Hunnam, Idris Alba, Rinko Kikiuchi as well as the rest of the cast was pretty solid and it was great to see Ron Perlman in another Del Toro film without his Hellboy costume this time. My 1 and only complain would be there were no Pacific Rim merchandise like popcorn boxes or drinks since it would have been an awesome addition to my current collection. Oh well, can't have it all my way Overall for Pacific Rim was an enjoyable ride and a must see film especially to all of you Mech fans out there

I must say that with the lack of major promotional support (i mean a lot of people i talked to did not even know about this movie)i did not have very high expectations for this movie. I just figured that the studio figured it was going to be a bust but they would release it anyway but decided to save a few advertising dollars.But i was so wrong. This has got to be one of the best action movies to come out this year. The CGI is almost flawless, the action sequences are great. The first 90 minutes are just pure movie gold. The last 30 are not as good. But boy is this movie one hell of a thrill ride of a movie. I highly recommend it, and do not listen to the critics make your own decision and my bet is that you will thoroughly enjoy it too

Action fans rejoice, for Pacific Rim has come to deliver the robot vs monster goodness the trailers tempted us with earlier this year. With stunning visuals, this movie does what its predecessors failed before to focus on the titans and not on the supporting humans, well at least not all the time. Battles involve adapting combat strategy and blending weapons with martial arts leading to some epic challenges that span for minutes at a time instead of a thirty second blast to the spark chamber. Combine this with the intense soundtrack and you get a collection of sequences that draw you into the adventure you've been craving for most of the summer. The plot isn't bad either, but movie goers like me will see how much they knocked off from other films. These mashed dynamics were nicely edited together, but I'll admit there are some tie-ins that are a bit overstretched for my taste and a bit lazy on their part. Unfortunately, the team failed the challenge of balancing combat between robots. Once again they built up an epic arsenal of robotic warriors, only to fail on giving them screen time, many having about four minutes of glory. Sorry, but what's the point of making these things if you're only going to focus on Optimus, I mean Gypsy. There are a few other things that this movie fails on, but overall it's a fun time at the movies, and in my opinion worthy of a trip to the 3-D cinema.

Guillermo del Toro's 'Pacific Rim' has robust action-sequences, superb visual effects & decent performances working for it, but what it lacks, is a solid screenplay. 'Pacific Rim' Synopsis: As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.'Pacific Rim' has a tepid first-hour, but an engaging & visually dazzling second-hour, which, by the way, is full of action & destruction. In terms of presentation, 'Pacific Rim' heartens, but when it comes to solid storytelling, 'Pacific Rim' disheartens. Travis Beacham & del Toro's Screenplay works in parts. The first-hour is slow-paced, while the second-hour delivers action-sequences in abundance. The Screenplay needed to be stronger! del Toro's Direction is imaginative. Visual Effects are Top-Class, while the Action-Sequences are stunning. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, deserve a mention.Performance-Wise: Idris Elba is perfect. Charlie Hunnam is very sincere, he enacts his part with gusto. Rinko Kikuchi is credible. Charlie Day is excellent. Ron Perlman is okay. Ellen McLain & Burn Gorman are fair. Clifton Collins Jr. lends support.On the whole, 'Pacific Rim' will appeal to those who LOVE Action Films.

I know, I know, its got almost rave reviews from most people here but I beg to disagree. I am really surprised that they saw anything of significance in the movie and it's a total cop out from the Mr. Shyamalan we have come to experience so far. Sorry, I just returned from the movie before it finished, yes before it finished, and it's a total washout, if you ask me. I am not going to reveal the storyline but its a plot which is not uncommon, humanity threatened by alien powers in brief. The special effects don't come into the movie until late and am sorry it come out crap. It might have some subtleness in its scope but it stands no way in comparison to the much simplistic but brilliantly devised Transformers. It just misses the point of marriage of visual effects with cause and chronology. There are advance robots which can work with a drivers mind but limited by the actions of human physiology, how lame can it get. It's like a mega version of Real steel but without the character and emotion of that movie. Waste of time more than money, if I have to be frank.

Great Movie: Go watch it.Guillermo del Toro just conned 190M usd, and created the ultimate macha-kaiju movie.As such the ride is amazing, the movie is full of references, winks and nods to all the tropes present in the genre.If you long were a child of the 80s, and grew with the likes of tranzor Z, Voltron, or robotech, you should watch this movie, unlike Bayformers this is truly an enjoyable experience, while bay does not get and despises the source material, Guillermo del Toro embraces his inner child and delivers Giant Mechas Rocket Punching Loevcraftian Horrors without a flinch.If you've watched any mecha anime or manga, or have watched kaiju before you should watch this.

As a kid growing up, a lot of the times during the Summer I would get bored with no one else around to hang out with. I mean, what else does a film obsessed kid do when he's bored in the Summer? Well, he makes a movie of course. However, what type of movies? There were no other kids around in my neighborhood to use as actors, so I made monster movies. Some of the times these movies starred our cat, but seeing as how living creatures were more difficult to work with, most of my monster movies starred a marionette creature or stuffed animals, with action figures playing the human roles. There were no scripts, just my imagination literally making everything up as I went along with our Hi-8 video camera in tow. All of this to say, I've always loved monster movies, and Pacific Rim may just be one of the best, if not the most original monster movies ever made.What makes Pacific Rim so original is that it mashes up two Japanese film genres, those of the giant monster and the giant robot, and creates a movie that is unlike anything that Western audiences have ever seen before. Pitting giant robots versus giant monsters was a genius idea that I wish I had come up with, and screenwriter Travis Beacham deserves huge kudos for coming up with the idea. The thing is though, this film wouldn't be worth watching if it didn't manage to have more going for it than just giant robots and giant monsters. Beacham and director Guillermo Del Toro go beyond that simple idea and actually have created likable characters and an involving story to go along with the awesome spectacle, and that's why Pacific Rim should be considered one of the best monster movies ever made.If you've ever seen any Godzilla movie or episode of Japanese animation (i.e. anime) featuring giant robots, then you will recognize all of the character types that exist in this movie. Pacific Rim is really like anime brought to life in live action, and if this movie can achieve such believable results, then can a live action Mobile Suit Gundam movie be far behind? One can only hope, but for right now, as a fan of anime and Japanese entertainment, Pacific Rim manages to introduce American audiences to all of the Japanese film and anime tropes that many of the kids in my generation have been in love with for our entire lives. However, I don't want anyone reading this who has never seen any anime or previous monster movies to think that this movie is not for them.Pacific Rim is really a movie for anyone who just loves a good time at the movies. It's fun, action packed, and is emotionally involving. Unlike so many Summer blockbusters that take themselves too seriously, Pacific Rim manages to balance the humor with the seriousness to create a lighthearted adventure film that still carries weight and consequence through the character's actions, but you're having a blast while the world is literally on the brink of destruction. Guillermo Del Toro treats this film as if it's like a propaganda film from the WWII days, where he's idolizing the pilots of these giant robots, trying to inspire humanity with hope and optimism to actually rise up and meet the monsters rather than getting crushed under their feet. Of course, I'll reiterate this point, had the characters not have worked, neither would have this movie. The characters and their relationships with one another are what gives this movie dramatic heft when it most matters, to where when we reach the action, it's not just mayhem for the sake of mayhem, it actually means something.In case you haven't noticed, I loved Pacific Rim. Few movies are this imaginative and this much fun, and that's the main thing to take away from this movie. From a design standpoint, this is one of the more meticulously crafted made up worlds I've seen in recent years, and that is a testament to Del Toro's gifted cinematic eye. The action is stand up and cheer awesome, thanks to amazing FX work from Industrial Light and Magic. As for the characters, none of them would work if the actors playing them weren't so likable, from Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, and Charlie Day, to the emotionally vulnerable performance from Rinko Kikuchi, they're the ones that actually make us care about the story. Bottom line, this isn't another Summer blockbuster trying to play off of post-9/11 fears and anxieties, it's literally a movie about the goodness of humanity and the power of the human spirit to work together when it's most needed, and who doesn't want to see that?I give Pacific Rim a 9 out of 10!

After seen, Man of Steel and Evil Dead (remake) I didn't thought that a movie could even get to the toe of them. But wend I saw Pacific Rim yesterday I knew I saw wrong.Pacific Rim is the best movie I have seen this year is action, the story is great the fighting scenes are mind blowing. The Monsters and robot looks are great. The direction , music, editing all was right and perfect. The acting was great. I really can think of anything I didn't like about it if one of the those films that are meant to be seen.100/100

In the future time, there's giant monster called "Kaiju" which has risen from beneath of Pacific ocean and ready to overtake earth. Some teams try to beat the monster by jet and tank but it takes many days to defeat it. To level the combat, special forces from around the world build robots named "Jaegers". "Jaegers" is operated by 2 pilots whom minds are locked into one so they could move the robot based on their movement."Spectacular" is the best word to describe 'Pacific Rim'. All of the action scene is captured really detail from the fight in the water, land or even on sky although it seems length of the movie is too short for massive problems like that. They tells first Kaiju's attack in fast way and just skip through the existing of "Jaegers". Also there's a little bit let down in storyline about human. It feels too boring and standard in storyline which is unusual for a high class director like Guilermo del Toro. And one of the most fatal mistake is there are no well-known actor here who could support this movie and make it more commercial. The actors don't act bad though, but in a summer big-budget movie, they should hire at least one popular actor as main role. Overall 'Pacific Rim' is one of the most satisfying movie at this summer season, it's big, fantastic and fun. Most credit should be given to the special effects members who create the combat between robot and monster look real. Also the IMAX 3D is incredible and worth to see. Unfortunately 'Pacific Rim' suffers with weak storyline that makes it flaw.

With his new science fiction thriller "Pacific Rim," director Guillermo del Toro effectively takes Michael Bay to school on how to make a movie about giant robots. Unlike Bay's torpid transforming nonsense, del Toro's film is thoughtful and smart. It may not be perfect, but it's got way more style, way more substance and way cooler robots. It's also got Ron Perlman as a black marketeer who runs an underground cartel dealing in alien body parts. Let's see Shia LaBeouf do that.Guillermo del Toro loves movie monsters, there's no doubt about it. If you've seen "Pan's Labyrinth" or "Mimic" or "Hellboy" then you know that he's not a director who just throws CGI around for its own sake. His movies are crafted with loving care. His characters have more dimension then we might expect and his stories actually have meaning. This is a guy who clearly loves movies.His latest is an ode to the monster movies he loved as a child growing up in Mexico. "Pacific Rim" takes place the future, when the Earth is being besieged by monsters, called "Kaiju," that have arrived in our world via a space portal beneath the Pacific Ocean. Following in the tradition of Godzillla and Mothra, these Kaiju have destroyed our cities, killed millions of people and depleted our resources. In response, the military has put together a strike force consisting of 50 foot robots called "Jaegers" which must be controlled by two pilots at the same time (right brain and left brain). The pilots are connected mentally through a neural bridge in a process called "The Drift", effectively allowing them to share the same memories and mental stability so they can work together. The two pilots share minds with each other and effectively are bonded for life.Our hero is Raleigh Becket (Chris Hunnum) a nice-looking loner who never-the-less nurses a wounded heart. Years ago, he was at the controls of one of these robots when his brother was killed while still connected to him. True to the form of half the movies ever made, the wounded hero is reluctantly pulled back into service despite claims by the program's commanding officer Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) that he is a loose cannon who doesn't follow orders. He also needs a new partner, and Pentecost reluctantly issues him another damaged soul named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) a Japanese pilot who bears the scars of having had her family wiped out by the Kaiju back in Japan when she was a child.Per his usual, del Toro allows these characters to have an extra dimension, but not so much that they get in the way of the smash and bash. They are connected to one another on an emotional level (the technology of the Jaegers demands it) just enough that we feel that there are people here and not just pawns to move around the plot. One of the great joys of the movie is that a lot of time is devoted to the humans discovering things about the Kaiju and how to defeat them.The characters are given an extra dimension, but only enough that they don't feel like throw-aways. The best performance in the movie (even under the constraints of pat dialogue) comes from Rinko Kikuchi as Mako. She's a talented actor who got a lot of attention – and an Oscar nomination – six years ago for her performance as Chieko in "Babel", as a deaf Japanese schoolgirl who filtered her grief over her mother's suicide into sexual rebellion. Kikuchi hasn't made a major American film since then, but she is still a talent waiting to be discovered by audiences. She has an open, expressive face, especially in the reaction shots: When she's not talking, she's listening, not just waiting for the other actor to finish so she can talk. She has a fine and delicate screen presence that suggests strengths waiting to surface.Another great performance comes from Charlie Day as a nervous scientist who is bright enough to use the neural bridge to mentally connect with one of the monsters to figure out their plan. With his hyperactive manner and high-pitched voice, Day is perfect for a movie like this. He plays Newton Geizler, a scientist who suddenly finds that he needs a severed alien brain and that puts him in contact with the oddly named Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman), a greasy black marketeer who has made his bones selling Kaiju body parts of every description. It has to be seen to be believed.One the human level, the movie works. It outclasses most science fiction hot air in which the technology overwhelms anything else. Where it comes up short is on the action itself. Yes, the special effects are impressive, and the robots here have more character than the ungainly Transformers. But, del Toro's special effects team makes the unwise decision to shoot every monster vs. robot battle at night and in close-up – usually while it's raining. These scenes, shot at a distance in broad daylight might have given us a little more visual orientation. We know what's at stake for the characters but we'd like a little more involvement. Still, del Toro has fashioned together a movie that is worth your time. Let's put it this way, if a Monsters vs. Robots movie has to be made, this is probably as good as it gets.***1/2 (of four)

The not-too-revealing-synopsis:In a not-too-distant future, political rivalries have given way to a unified construction and military effort to combat a shared, other-worldly threat. New technology and science produce the next generation of defenses for the Earth. These new defenses, dependent on humans, are limited by their vulnerabilities while simultaneously bolstered by their vitality.The not-too-revealing-review:Pacific Rim captures "big". The movie convincingly relates the big threat to humanity, the big communal response, the big industrial production, and the big adversary. This near future is even made plausible on the political, technological, and fantasy level. The movie fails, however, to escape the graphic novel origins. Where storyline development could have come through the explanation and development of the futuristic technology, it settles for unsurprising weaponry "reveals"; where it could have entertained grand science fiction questions, it throws in another action scene; where it could have showcased large-scale action choreography, it focuses in on a punch landing or head being knocked backward. It belongs in the video game movie genre with all the flaws one expects to accompany such a label: weak storyline, repetitive action scenes, and cliché characters. It does fare better than expected in a number of categories: the acting was acceptable nor and the character development was less than ruinous. It was as shiny and glossy as one expects from a big budget motion picture of this sort, but the action scenes were sluggish and clunky. It matches up with Transformers in effects but is more Godzilla (1954) in terms of action choreography. I enjoyed it while I was in the theater, but I will not think fondly of it on the outside. I do not recommend the movie, but neither would I discourage those who desire a good solid two hours of big effects and mayhem.Acting: 6/10 Cinematography: 7/10 Character Development: 5/10 Choreography: 3/10 Storyline: 6/10 Resonance: 1/10

"Pacific Rim" is the latest creation from Spanish visionary Guillermo del Toro (director of "Pan's Labyrinth" and the "Hellboy" movies). The film tells the story of the pilots of giant robotic machines called Jaegers who must go head to head with invading, sky-scraping beasts called Kaiju, making for some of the most jaw-dropping showdowns in recent cinema. And while the film's greatest achievement is its astounding visual effects, the human element is never lost in the mix.The film is told from the human perspective, making for some true edge-of-your-seat entertainment as the pilots are shaken and tossed around in the head of the Jaegers, adding suspense and jeopardy to scenes mostly rendered in a computer - in the hands of a lesser director, the fight scenes could easily be detached and cartoonish, but del Toro allows the audience to stay with the pilots and control centers, giving these extended battle royales genuine gravitas.The acting is well-done and each of the protagonists is given a back story and good motivations, but it is Idris Elba who delivers a standout performance as the commander of the Jaeger program. While our main hero, played by Charlie Hunnam, is given a decent character arc and background, he isn't fleshed out as well as Elba's or even Rinko Kikuchi's character, so you don't necessarily care about him as much as the other two protagonists.Ultimately, "Pacific Rim" is a feast for the eyes with human drama added for good measure. The main draw of the film is obviously the clash of the titans element, but audiences will also be able to connect to the characters, enriching those moments of ocean-moving, building-tumbling collisions as two beasts, one from another world, one man-made, pummel each other to the death.

First of all, I kept a high expectation on this movie. Every time I saw the trailers/behind-the-scene during the past couple months I was hoping July 12 would come earlier. Now let's talk about the pros. The visual effects are absolutely first- class, as well as the sound mixing. I also enjoy the cool customs (armor/helmet) of the movie. Every guy dreams arming with it and fighting against giant monsters! Fighting scenes are also great. Enough good words. I want to talk about what makes me uncomfortable with this movie. Warnings again: spoilers. The story line starts in a really good way. Raleigh (Charlie) lost his brother in a fight and also lost his confidence to be a pilot. I was hoping that the story will tell how he overcomes this history after spending 5 years constructing, and it does - until five seconds later when his new co-pilot, Mako (Rinko), has more fear to overcome. Then it spent another 10 minutes addressing her problems and forgot to mention how Raleigh overcame his for the rest of the movie.Later it turns to talk about Stacker(Idris)'s problems and drives our attentions to a brand-new side of the story. What comes between the main storyline is Gottlieb-Newton bromance. However, it addresses the bromance for 5 minutes before returning to the ambiguous relationship between Raleigh and Mako and Stacker's love, care and encouragements to Mako. Other elements, such as Ron's character, father-son relations and meaningless fights (not the giant type), further drive audience's attention away.I felt extremely discouraging to form a high anticipation about how the story will flow from the plots, but then found out that the director did stress it, but just for a couple minutes before turning to other aspects. Later I was so good at predicting the story, telling myself that well, anyway, the story will just spend another 5 minutes on this or that. The movie has a lot to offer other than visual effects, but it is over-ambitious, trying to include as many elements as possible.The way the story starts seems to indicate that it wants to talk about Raleigh, but instead it goes more about Stacker. In-between is Miko, which adds to confusions about how she eventually pilots well. If you think summer blockbusters like this, Star Trek or Iron Man 3, do not even need a storyline, you will absolutely disagree with me. I am not saying that it has to have a wonderful or heart-breaking storyline as drama does, which is also beyond my expectation. What I am saying is that, you give a hint about how the story will go, and you go for it and go deep enough for it. You have a lot to tell, which is great, but focus on those that form the characters. IMAXize and 3Dize the characters you want to create.North Carolina, U.S.

This could have been amazing, but there are too many plot holes and pointless detours for it to fulfill my (not very high) expectations.Not only does del Toro show no real understanding of what it means to be "Pacific" (culturally, geographically, in terms of the space or urban landscapes), he manages to conflate pretty much all of Asia into one gigantic stereotype - and those Australian accents were so bad I almost walked out!At the end of the day, there were a few passingly good action scenes, and a couple of almost- brilliant moments of apocalyptic doom, but the lack of believable (or interesting) characters (and the fact that 3 of the male leads looked almost identical), paired with the absence of any engaging settings (most of the battles are in the ocean), make this a fairly sub-par offering.And did I mention that accents were really, really terrible? With the lackluster performances from Martini and Kazinsky (a Brit and an American), you could have hired pretty much any Australian guy off the street to do better. And why are Aussie characters so often mean and have bull-dogs? Being stupid and having bull mastiffs would make more sense - or being stoners with an old collie or a cattle dog. But vengeful and competitive, with a British bull- dog? Nothing good to say about those two characters, at all. Waste of time.

Too many plot holes. Too much talking. Too long. Difficult to see action sequences. Too many action movie clichés. I went to this movie with a bunch of friends and we all disliked it. While I have never walked out on a film I was very tempted to walk out of this one.The worst part though was the flat interaction between most of the main characters. The two biggest offenders are Burn Gorman and Charlie Day who are inane as the squabbling experts. Even the introduction of Ron Perlman fails to ignite the screen as he phones in his part.The only saving grace was Idris Elba, who plays the role of the Marshall with the same intensity as his TV character Luther.

Pacific Rim (2013) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Guillermo del Toro's latest is a grand throwback to the days when Godzilla and other large monsters stalked the screens. Set in the future, the Earth comes under attack by giant sea monsters so they create giant robots controlled by two pilots so that they can be destroyed. It doesn't take long for the monsters to recapture the upper hand and as time on Earth is running out the humans must come up with a new plan of attack. PACIFIC RIM isn't a masterpiece but it's about as good as a film like this can get. While there are a couple flaws to be found along the way, there's still no way to deny that this here is pure entertainment from start to finish. Obviously del Toro knows his genre so fans will see all sorts of winks to earlier movies but the director takes it to the next level and really delivers something that is a lot of fun and full of wonderful action. I'm one who usually speaks against CGI not because of the technique but because so many directors don't know how to properly use it. That's certainly not the case here because the monsters, the robots and the broken down and destroyed cities all look real. This here is very important because it allows one to really connect with everything that's going on on the screen. Another major plus here is that the action scenes are full of wonderful imagination. The battle sequences are usually long, very destructive and oh so much fun and this includes a rather amazing sequence at the end that's underwater. The performances are also quite good with Charlie Hunnam, Diego Klattenhoff and especially Idris Elba all fitting their roles nicely. Ron Perlman also has a nice supporting bit. As I said, I think there were a couple flaws with one being the running time, which I felt was a bit too long as ten or fifteen-minutes off would have helped things. There were also a few too many shots that were extremely close to the action to the point where you can't get the full view of all the destruction going on. Still, PACIFIC RIM is a great throwback to the early monster films and it's fun from the word go.

10/10. I have been waiting for a movie like this for a long time. Growing up and going to the movies to watch Godzilla movies. I loved them but I always wished they could be done better. Cloverfield was awesome but I wanted more. Transformers are also a favorite but no monsters there. Pacific Rim really delivers. I have to say this is the best monster move of all time. Also the Robots (Jaegers) are incredible. Not a dull moment in this movie. I am going back tomorrow to see it in the IMAX theater. I want to see it in 3D now. The music score fit and sounded great. Pacific Rim starts fast and end with a fury. It keeps you locked in till the credits roll but don't forget to stay for the snippet after the first round of credits. Very funny. This is one of the best movies I have seen this summer. Right up there with the new Star Trek and maybe a little better than Iron Man 3. The movie does not disappoint. Go see it if you really want to be entertained for 2 Plus hours. You will not be sorry. After watching it at IMAX..... AWESOME! My new favorite movie. I may have to go see it for a third time. I was reading some of the negative reviews and I do not understand where these people's perspectives come from. Haters is all I see. This is one of Best summer movies in a long time. I can't stop thinking about how GREAT the movie was. I can't wait for the Blu Ray!

I had many reasons to watch it, one, I was a huge fan of 'Godzilla' movie, saw it when I was a kid and being speechless for many days. Two, Guillermo Del Toro. Three, I always eager to watch a good visual effect movie on big screen, so I am graphic geek.The story follows when giant monsters known as Kaiju rises from beneath the Pacific ocean, the war between human and them commences. Initially millions of humans lose their lives in the series of Kaiju attacks. To fight those monsters humans creates monsters like giant robots called Jaegers. This makes the war between them fair enough to compete each others and balanced until the monsters started to gain the fighting power back from the humans. So the years pass the apocalypse nears, the humans need to stand and fight one final time to defend the Earth and what happen next were the grand finale.I feel deja vu now, wait, I have seen before these giant robots somewhere before. It took more than a moment to figure it out. In my childhood I saw them in the television cartoon show, Duckstales but I don't know what they are called. Those were kinda similar to these giants.When 'Transformers' and 'Godzilla' comes together it forms 'Pacific Rim'. A $220 million movie which made lots of buzz on movie goers, including me. Wondered what was he (Guillermo Del Toro) planing all this year since 'The Golden Army' which released a half decade ago. The more gap between the movies, the expectation grows higher and I was just curious to see this movie than thinking how it could be. Even I had set countdown in my phone for this day (12-07-2013) since last 60 days. Finally the day came, as a movie freak I wanted to see it in IMAX, since there is no IMAX around me I had no choice but go for regular silver screen digital 3D version.Does it worth seeing in digital 3D? is the million dollar question from the people who are looking forward to see this movie. I say definitely worth it, what is the use to see an advanced technique and a CGI graphic movie in the regular version. Movies like these are meant to see in digital 3D because it is not some comedy or sentimental drama but a huge action pact movie. Don't expect pop-ups, that's for amateurs who are new to experience the 3D illusions. It was shot in regular 2D then converted to digital 3D so it was better but not so awesome.The movie had not serious big names in the cast. There is no one particularly to say who done great work but they all performed their best. The Japanese girl Rinko Kikuchi was kinda cute, as the movie was inspired from Japanese monster tales she added the Japanese flavour to the movie. Ron Perlman was good, expected little more screen space for him. Charlie Hunnman and Idris Elba, they both were okay especially Charlie Day has been so nice just like he was in 'Horrible Bosses'. Looks like he's a new sensation in comedy World, hope a great future ahead of him.Geographically speaking I am happy that this whole movie won't take place in the United States itself after all it was theirs movie. Hollywood has a Worldwide fan base so when they make movie from outside the regular geographical stream the audience from the rest of the World will always welcome it.It was not the best movie nor the worst that I have seen in this monsoon. For a $220 million movie the graphics were so awesome, the action and stunts were breathtaking but by far the story was so weak especially the character developments. Whenever you see Kaiju and Jaeger on the screen it will be the thrilling experiences but other than that the development happening around the human characters were little boring I mean it was emotionless. When it compared to 'Godzilla', 'Godzilla' was well balanced between them two while in 'Pacific Rim' it was one sided and that is all about graphic, actions and 3D. These modern movie techniques carried the whole movie with their shoulder and made to look better. I can say these special effects were the highlight of the movie.Like my synopsis say it was decent till the end then confuses with few common logic. If you just ignore it, the movie will give you the best entertainment that you have paid for. If you are looking for a good story, twist and characters then it is not the right choice, this movie was totally an action packed with awesome graphics. This movie will more suitable for younger audiences.

This is Real Steel, Transformers, Godzilla and your favorite alien invasion action movie, all packed into one. The focus is on the visual effects and battle scenes, there are some interesting sci-fi ideas but minimal attention was devoted to their details, the acting is good, the plot is predictable but engaging and the character development is again minimal but enough (aka optimal).We are all probably used to stunning effects by now so what makes this one different? I would say its the seamless fusion of so many ideas, Godzilla sized monster aliens and to combat them Transformer sized fight machines guided by humans in co-ordination(like in Real Steel but more intricate). Also unlike many action movies that try too hard to be emotionally deep and end up being miserably melodramatic or shallow, this one hits the sweet spot. Also there is at least something amusing about a metal brute wrestling a bulbous acid throwing flying Godzilla, right?One disappointment for me was that there was potential for a lot of nice sci-fi conceptual depth but the details were mostly left out unless needed for comprehending the plot and also the acting performances could have been slightly better but Idris Elba was awesome in his role, even his voice was perfect for his dialogues.On the whole a nice and refreshing movie, if the trailers give you a run of the mill feeling I would still recommend watching it (on the best screen possible), it might surprise you.

It occurred to me even as I watched it that PACIFIC RIM was a lifelong dream come true: a live-action version of the ASTRO BOY and GIGANTOR cartoons I'd watched as a child, done right. Del Toro doesn't waste a lot of time trying to infuse PACIFIC RIM with the kind of boring, pointless melodrama that most such movies engage in: he gets down to business early on and rarely strays from the program. (The jab at Modern Man's world-destroying efforts is appreciated.) Moviegoers who've waited for a true Summer Blockbuster will walk away satisfied, though the hype surrounding this movie has been a tad on the RESERVED side, if you ask me: considering what we have here- the overall scale of EVERYTHING-, the trailers should've been Longer and even Louder. The fx actually ENHANCE the drama, the way fx always should (but rarely do). If you're a fan of Giant Monster movies or Giant Robot movies or Giant Monsters vs. Giant Robots movies, you're in luck: PACIFIC RIM is now playing.

After seeing pacific rim I have to say the visual effects were stunning, Idris Elba was awesome as he portrayed the steel plated commander 'Staker Pentecost' and was as strong and temperamental as he is in 'Luther'. The acting overall was up to scratch from the whole cast in particular Charlie Day as 'Dr. Newton Geiszler certainly offered the audience some comic relief from all the action. The Plot was of course was ridiculous but the visual effects and action throughout more than compensates. overall a fun action-packed movie for enjoyable watching. 7.5

You have to think hard to find a bad Guillermo del Toro film. I can't think of any, and this one won't be one either. It is a clear winner. To me, I think it is the best monster movie since Jurassic Park, and the best sci-fi invasion movie since Independence Day! Look, there is no need to discuss the movie in detail. Just go see it. You'll enjoy the fun. It is quite original in many ways despite the large monsters and giant robots. Trailers, while good, simply cannot do justice to the brilliance of the movie. If you liked Hellboy, you'll like this movie. If you liked Pan's Labyrinth, you'll like this movie. If you liked Mimic, you'll like this movie. It's got everything. The whole plot and story works hand in glove! The production quality is superior!

Pacific Rim (2:11, PG-13, Imax, 3-D) — 2 — SF, biggie, original, OSIT chauvinistsClocking in at 2:11, the exact same running length as Iron Man 3 (and also with the same PG- 13 rating), Pacific Rim manages about 10% of the personality and intellectual content, traded off for about 400% of the death, destruction, general smashing, and noise.It's a mash-up of the rubber-suited Godzillas (now rendered in 3-D by state-of-the-art computers to no greater degree of credibility) and the incredibly noisy, frenetic, jumble-cut train wrecks of the Transformers series. What appear to be people walk thru several of the scenes, generally shouting at or speaking severely to each other in intense tones — except for the wild-eyed, agitated jargon-slinging of the last 2 scientists on Earth that you'd want entrusted with the preservation of civilization (who, of course, are exactly that).Much of the dialog is muddled and only semi-intelligible, except for some nice, crisp subtitles on the screen when the only female for 100 klicks in any direction, Mako Mori (played by the charming Rimko Kikuchi, the only person in the entire movie who ever smiles), gets off a few lines of ritual self-deprecation and submissiveness. Otherwise it's a testosterone-laden gonad flaunting to see who owns the fire hydrant.Mori and ostensible hero Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) are co-pilots of Gypsy Danger, the last remaining Mark 3 model jaeger (German for "fighter"), which is a truly gargantuan robotic fighting machine that's so complicated it requires 2 synced-up human brains (said to be "in the drift" when linked) to control it properly. The Mark 3 is recommissioned after all the newer models are rendered useless when the invading kaiju (Japanese for "giant beasts"), arriving thru a trans-dimensional rift on the Pacific floor, deploy electrical zappers to short out all the digital electronics. "But the Mark 3 is analog", exclaims Becket, as he volunteers to take it out to battle a pair of kaiju who emerged in only the last couple of hours to threaten Hong Kong (after earlier lone monster warriors had wreaked havoc on San Francisco, Manila, and either Cabo or Kabul — couldn't tell from the garbly soundtrack).The human-seeming characters have tried in the past to nuke the rift in the ocean floor and so seal it off from further kaiju incursions, but they've had trouble getting past some obstacle whose name and nature are fleetingly alluded to and thereafter ignored. This time, tho, they have the advantage of some work-around that one of the scientists discovered when doing a jaeger-pilot-style mind-meld with what's left of the brain of an earlier kaiju.The time it took you to read the above plot description is about as much as what the movie spent on it. Yet Travis Beacham will still collect a check for what is honorarily known as a "screenplay". Fully 80% of the film is just whirling, thudding, smashing, bashing fight scenes, which move so fast and in such close-up (also generally in darkness and lots of splashing water, since this is a surf movie of a sort) that you can't tell who's who or who's doing what to which.I saw it in Imax (a good size screen for the spectacle that director Guillermo Del Toro is obviously trying to create), 3-D (originally shot as such for the CGI scenes but post-converted for the minority of the film that pretends to pay attention to people), and 20,000 watts of surround sound (which blessedly weren't quite as deafening as the literally painful Transformers 2). The talents of Ramin Djawadi, who wrote the haunting, evocative theme song to HBO's Game of Thrones, are here wasted on what I'm sure he was instructed to render as pompous bombast, which plays relentlessly under almost every scene.There's a welcome cameo appearance by Ron Perlman as a larger-than-life underworld figure who's discovered that the market for powdered rhino horn or tiger penis pales in comparison to what flaccid Asian men are apparently willing to pay on the black market for reprocessed kaiju.You know that Del Toro is going to max out the visuals, and he doesn't disappoint in that regard, which is one of the few things keeping this regrettable pile of brainless, pointless, overwrot violence from sinking all the way down that rift in the Pacific trenches to a rating of 1.

Two words come to mind that are generally synonymous with Mexican director/writer Guillermo Del Toro, an undeniably creative auteur who has a familiarity with various pop-culture mediums, multiple mythologies, and a keen sense of original storytelling, and those words are passionate and imaginative. Whether it's the brooding vampiric mythos of his debut film Cronos, the dark escapism of his fantasy tale Pan's Labyrinth, or even the colorful superhero interpretation of the Dark Horse Comics character Hellboy there is a distinct feel, tone, and beauty that links all of his varying yet inventive pieces together. His latest passion project Pacific Rim, a blend of Japanese pop-culture influenced monster films with a live action anime intention, undoubtedly shares a great deal of characteristics a majority of his other films possess, including his odd humor deviations, impeccable detail, and a particular visual tone, and yet doesn't possess enough to distinguish itself from the rest of the summer blockbuster parade of mediocrity. Pacific Rim opens with the potential of a truly original and intriguingly conceptual work for the science-fiction genre but the film not only leaves behind the braininess early on for too much loud, abrasive brawn it also doesn't possess enough heart in the lumbering beast of a film machine to make a true link between the director's passionate fun and the audience's potential sympathetic investment. Del Toro's intentions with Pacific Rim are clearly about making pleasurable absurdity with self-consciousness towards the ridiculousness of his own premise but it is unfortunately anchored down by its stilted dialogue, inappropriate uses of humor amidst often times boring drama, and incredibly limited performances interpreting apathetically developed characters. Instead of getting a usual dose of Del Toro creativity through makeup artistry, distinct set designs, and beautifully imagined characters we've been given a rather hollow and undoubtedly dumb CGI-fest of giant monsters, giant robots, and giant destruction which for the most part is amusing though highly disappointing. Though Pacific Rim contains a myriad of blockbuster clichés they are presented in a humorously self-referential fashion through Del Toro's signature imagination but the final product feels limited by the expansive use of freewheeling special effects instead of enhanced which is the usual outcome for a majority of typical, loud, and expensive blockbuster films.Read more on this review: http://wp.me/py8op-AC; read more reviews: Generationfilm.net

Pacific Rim is a movie that knows exactly what it wants to be and delivers because everything put to screen is executed wonderfully. The performances are spot on and the actors really do make you care for the characters even with very little development or exposition. I liked the fact that the movie is its own sequel. Meaning, they cut through all the origin and set up of this world in the first 15 minutes. It's like a built in fast forward button. As it was unfolding, I kept thinking to myself that they are skipping over some pretty big and important stuff. Stuff we'd like to see and maybe should have seen. Yet, that wasn't really the case because what was left perfectly fit the story and certainly delivered the monster VS giant robot action everyone paid to see. The monsters are truly frightening and the CGI very well done. This film's budget has made news but at least it felt like they spent everything on screen.Overall, this was a very fun trip to the cinema.

I've just watch Pacific Rim i'm going to give you a short review on what i thought no spoiler I promise :) . Right fact one is if you can see past the power ranger, transformer, Godzilla & independence day feel of the film, its surprisingly a fantastic film. It has emotion moments with some pretty intense moments which balance the film out, a lot of thought & passion has gone into this film as it shows a lot about Honor & respect in combat situation. The C.G.I design on the creature's & the robot's were amazing & it has some of the best monster fight scenes that you will think wow!!!! that was awesome, but there is a slight twist in the story which I cant say because it will give away spoiler.What I can say is I don't think this film will be for all, as I said if you can't get past the simple film mix you won't like this film or find it fantastic or entertaining. To me I loved this film for what it is, a very passionate, emotion action fight for survival film that really gives this film its edge. Film rating for me 8 out of 10.

If you asked me how would you like to watch 'Monsters vs Robots' battle it out, I would LMAO at your face without regret. If you ask me now, I would search for words out of dictionary to throw some gigantic jargon at you. This as good as world cinema could get, Watching this in IMAX made me feel, so small like a stray dog watching an elephant pass by. You will blame me for setting too much expectation, I had none when I walked in,bang it hit me at the entrance & it hit me with rocket elbow punches right on my face again & again. Till I Bowed down to this shear colossal force. ‪Deltoro‬ was absolutely right saying "I did not want one country saving the world but the world saving the world" He lived up to his word ‪#‎respect‬. ‪Ramin Djawadi‬ swells yours eyes through your ears & a raising heart to feel panic,that will stay long after you are done. yes, this is the same stuff we've seen in Transformers, Real Steel & a Whole bunch of Japanese Kaiju films. How is this different from those? it's better on everything they've missed out on. Makes you feel others are just trailers for this epic event to happen this day. Just http://j.mp/gobigorgoextinct

Guillermo del Toro is a master. He's a great director and his eye for the visual is unmatched. (Hear that Michael Bay). This is the Japanese mecha tribute movie that fans of the genre have been waiting on for years. Del Toro convey's the weight and heft of these massive robots and creatures to perfection. The fight scenes are not lost in a dizzying array of CGI. They are focused and matrix-esque fun to watch. Moreover this is just a fantastic fun popcorn flick that has some great messages about team work. The pace of the movie never really gets boring and the nice little tidbits that pay homage to classics like Ultraman (The creature style and markings) shine through without being overly corny. Go grab the kids, get your popcorn on and enjoy this roller-coaster ride for the senses.

An absolutely dull and stupid movie. I understand that the RuleOfCool sometimes demands stupid and unrealistic situations, just to be cool.But this film has waaaaay too much of them. Like total human stupidity in this film: 1) A global sea wall, really?2) What are they thinking - there's only one portal that can be easily monitored and guarded. Yet we have monsters attacking freaking Alaska with mechas thinly spread all over the globe.3) Absolutely stupid pilots. A monster destroyed our cannon and other weapons, we have nothing left! (I'm obliged to say that by the rules of our trade union to increase the amount of drama)No, we have that absolutely awesome sword that can cleave a monster in two! But we didn't use until the last moment just because it wouldn't be cool if we defeated the monster in a couple of seconds!4) Unrealistic radiation disease.5) Extra stupid "oxygen level 15%".6) Battle on the ocean floor 3km down. In hole-ridden leaking mechas. Really? A leak at this depth would produce a jet strong enough to cut steel. After a time I simply couldn't stop laughing. And it doesn't help that the most of the movie is just one large mecha-fight scene.Oh, and characters... Let's not talk about them.

Guillermo del Toro, the visionary director of Blade2, Pan's Labrinth and Hellboy has done the impossible. Large Robots...Large Monsters...and I COULD NOT WAIT FOR THIS FILM TO END SO I COULD LEAVE!. How do you screw up a movie with Charlie Hunnan, Charlie Day and Idris Elba? The answer is very simple: You make the movie for you, and not for the audience. This is Del Toro's guilty pleasure...like Tarantino's "Sukyaki Western Django"...this is merely a collection of images and activities that Del Toro put to screen to entertain himself and himself alone. I am sure his preoccupation with Manga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga) fueled this masturbatory CGI exercise. I actually felt as if i'd lost a few I.Q. points after sitting through what could only be referred to as the "Battlefield Earth" of the millennial generation. In closing, let me say that i'd rather do yard work, than sit through this film again.

PACIFIC RIM brought me to my childhood days when Ultraman was fighting with monsters. Story goes with aliens rising beneath our ocean floor and invading the entire earth for some reason (watch the movie). Because the aliens are huge (pre historic days and behave like a drunk King Kong), governments from across the globe united to create an elite team to combat these aliens in the form of engineered robots (Jaegers) with distinct fighting gears. The catch is its mostly a two man vessel connected to a neural bridge. Huh? Since its a large robot one person serves as the right brain while the other the left. Their memories are merged and their brains (not literally) as well to serve as one main CPU for their android. To cut the story short, they need to kill the monsters (Kaiju) to save human race. To make it long, to top that we have a melodramatic lead actor and his sidekick, a drama queen as well. Too many characters playing certain roles to extend the movie more than two hours. It has too much testosterone that it felt like watching 300. Their plot may fall short but Ill give them two thumbs up for technicalities and attention to detail. When the movie ended, I wanted to be a Jaeger because I got moves like jagger (now laugh). Overall, it's a visual effects feast and what's interesting is our annoying seatmate whose queries are due to his disconnection from the movie. If only he was not sleeping. 3 out of 5 popcorns

Del Torro hits it out of the ball park with this flick. The Controlled balance between story and action is perfect. A solid movie in all fronts. If you like robots, monsters and mix of good drama (no matter how superficial it my be) then this is a movie is for you. The little ones will not like it so much and the movie is very loud and there is a lot going on the movie that they will easily get lost. The older children it is fine and may appreciate more the movie that the little ones. How I know this? Standing in line and see what type of people are in line helps, and while the movie is playing you can hear the little fuss during the quiet scenes and the cry during the loud. While the family behind me the boys said "wow! awesome!" a couple of time. GO and see it! Can't wait for Hellboy 3!

Excellent, definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year, for me I like the robot battles, I've seen in other films and series, well, I loved this. The effects were amazing, the story I liked a lot. Epic scenes had time no see, great speeches, those who are in the great movies. A film something different, which I think, was excellent, I recommend it without hesitation.Worth going to the cinema to see films like this. A shame I could not see it in 3D.Best quote: "To fight monsters, we created monsters".Gypsy Ranger, what a warrior! What are you waiting for? Go see this movie now!

Robots vs. Giant Monsters? What could possibly go wrong? How about bad acting, bad pacing, shallow and clichéd characters, and long stretches between action that feel like they're from another movie? Heck, it'll almost feel like you're watching a sequel to an earlier movie. I get that they wanted to put us in the middle of the story to better catch our attention and intrigue, but it would've been nice to see more of the start of the war instead of a summary. Therein lies one of the movie's main problems: it's rushed in some place...and slow in others. The other problem? The characters are paper thing cutouts we've seen before, and better.This is also displayed very early in when we meet our hero, Raleigh Becket, and his brother. They literally start their day battling a kaiju...and Raleigh's brother is killed. Thing is, we never learn anything about him other than he's the older brother and that's it. There's no reason to be sad when he's killed. Raleigh misses him deeply, but the audience isn't given any reason to miss him at all. Likewise, most of the other "Jaeger" pilots are just...there. They don't have any personality and play a ridiculously small role for people piloting giant robots to fight monsters. The ones that do have some personality/play a role are one-note stereotypes we've seen before.The only other pilot who really stands out is Mako Mori. She's given the most depth & backstory...but it's sadly undermined by Rinko Kikuchi's performance. And wouldn't ya know it, she and Raleigh have a romantic subplot that's dull and fairly intrusive. Raleigh himself is a boring, clichéd, unlikable hero. He has no personality other than being your standard issue fighting ace who fell from grace, but still has amazing, almost superhuman skills. That's all there is to him and we never really learn any more than that. It doesn't help that Charlie Hunnam is just another action movie star who'd skills seem limited to shouting, scowling, and smirking.Luckily, there's some good supporting players. Iris Elba gives the movie's best performance as the team leader Commander Pentecost. Ron Pearlman seems to be enjoying himself as (the snazzy dressed) black marketer Hannibal Chau. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman bring some energy & comic relief as a pair of scientists (though they can be kind of annoying)Thing is, it really could've all turned out better. The Kaiju are massive and bestial and look as fearsome as giant monsters would be if they were real.The Jaegers all have unique designs and abilities to help them standout (even if their pilots don't). The battles between them are fast, brutal and bombastic and are indeed the highlight of the film,especially in some pretty good 3D. Unfortunately, when there isn't any Kaiju vs. Jaeger action, it's as boring as a movie about cities being destroyed in battles between giant monsters and robots can be...

So. Pacific Rim. In all honesty, how much you like the movie depends almost entirely on what you're expecting and what you like in movies.If you're watching the movie for mecha vs. monster action, then you will not be disappointed. The kaiju designs are wonderful, and at times wonderfully creepy, and the special effects make everything shine. There are plenty of battles and action, and mecha fans will be amused by homages to various mechas in media, even if non-mecha fans find those homages over- the-top. The movie takes a fair amount of time for world-building, which will appease action- seekers who are new to mechas. The action sequences will definitely have everyone on the edges of their seats; it's hard to dislike the movie on the basis of its action.However, it's very easy to dislike the movie in other ways. The characters are almost all painfully two-dimensional, and there's not much development to speak of. (Some characters are lucky enough to have some, but most go without, or with very weak development.) In fact, basically nothing here is character-driven. Characters interact, but you only glean the most basic of facts about them from their conversations. By the end of the movie, you know a bare handful of facts about each character, and with one or two exceptions, it's hard to see the characters as real, complex people. I don't remember most of the characters' names, and I'll only remember the characters themselves because of the actors playing them. The writing isn't much more impressive. Much of the dialogue is clunky and repetitive, and the movie itself is extremely predictable at times. (Arguably, the predictability is due to homages to mecha and kaiju films/series.) Also, there is an astounding lack of diversity in the cast. Of the named characters, only two are women, and of the named characters with substantial speaking parts, all are white except for Elba and Kikuchi, even though most of the movie is set in Hong Kong. Personally, I prefer my movies to be character-driven, so I was unimpressed with this film— and thus the rating. But, as I said, whether you love or hate the movie has to do with your personal tastes. Are you a mecha fan who loves action scenes? Then you'll probably adore this movie. But if you, like me, prefer complex characters who interact with each other in ways that aren't driven by plot, you'll probably want to pass on this one.

When I first saw the trailers for Pacific Rim I thought that the story was going to be complete garbage but that the action scenes were going to be pretty cool. Well I was wrong, the story was actually somewhat interesting and I walked out of the movie theater impressed by the plot, along with the action. If you think that this movie is only made to impress your eyes, you are kind of right, but there is a lot more to the movie than that. This is a guy movie hands down, but it is actually worth the movie going experience. The acting can get bad in some spots but I thought that Charlie Day, Charlie Hunham, and Ron Perlman carried this pretty well. If you are going to see this movie because of the awesome giant robots vs giant aliens scenes, you will not be disappointed. One of the best movies of the summer in my opinion

Robots and monsters, how could anyone go wrong with this combo?This movie does not disappoint and it provides a great theater experience. The film is fast paced and has stunning special effects. I think that sometimes we really take for granted some of the CGI and effects that these big budget movies tend to produce, but this flick has some of the best.If you have the means, Google your nearest IMAX theater and see this in IMAX 3D. I caught the early (Thursday night) preview of this movie in regular 3D and it was really great, but just saw the movie again in IMAX 3D and it really enhances the experience. Yes, it's pricey, but this film is well worth it.I know there are always a few reviews that will always be critical of something; we tend to criticize way too much. Do yourself a favor and just go see it. You will NOT be disappointed.Excellent movie. Great special effects. Good story line. Enough said!

Okay if you are a mark like me for a movie about Giant Robots battling Monsters from another Dimension, then you will love this movie. The number one thing you have to know is that this is a B movie. Its meant to be goofy, implausible, fun. Besides all that, though is that it tries to deliver those qualities in the best possible way. It fully owns up to what it is and delivers those qualities 100%. Cool looking monsters and Robots, definitely. Bad ass action scenes, check. A somewhat hokey plot that still sounds cool, double check. Basically you either buy into the concept and enjoy a well made movie or go watch something else.

This movie is by far THE BEST ROBOTS MOVIE ever made. Okay, it may not be as breathtaking as Transformers in the audio perspective, but the making of famous Japanese Gundam-like robots into Hollywood movie made this piece of work a marvelous add for the future robot movies.The storyline is definitely full of cheesy anime dialogues, the actors I have seen none of them are famous enough to be on my Hollywood radar (except Ron Perlman), but the directing, art, graphic, visual aid are very much superbbb!I love the geeky professor SNL star Charlie Day and antagonist character played by Hanibal Chau, they really stole the scenes.What really made this movie worked was the director.Great job, Guillermo del Toro!

Pacific Rim is a sweet blend of several superb ingredients: the ambition and mass-destruction of kaiju films (such as Godzilla or Gamera), the premise and high-tech concepts of mecha anime (like Neon Genesis Evangelion), and the familiar style and imagination of Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy I and II, Pan's Labyrinth, and more). It's especially noteworthy since there has never really been any major blockbuster films that portray giant robots and giant monsters on screen together; we've always had one or the other, but it's pretty common fare for mecha anime to slam them together and make them fight. A film like this seems long overdue.As expected, the action in Pacific Rim is very big and incredible. There are three major battles that pit towering machines against rampaging sea monsters from another world. Entire cities crumble within the film's prologue; in the fights that ensue, buildings get crushed, cars and trucks are thrown all over the place, and it truly seems like the world could get trampled at any moment. In between the battles, the film breathes pretty evenly, with the same playful energy that made the Hellboy movies so fun. Humor doesn't really play into it that much, but with the acting and colorful production design, this film is never all that serious or brooding; it's rather cheesy, lighthearted, over-the-top, and cartoonish. And it's fun that way.It's not all about the big fights and silliness though; the film has a solid focus on storytelling. It does take some effort though. The film introduces a plethora of clever concepts behind the premise of giant robots and monsters: terms like "drifting" and "neural handshake" become integral to the plot, and if you're not digging the concept, you might get lost (having already been familiar with even deeper concepts in the Evangelion saga, I couldn't help but to draw comparisons; in spite of that, I found Pacific Rim easy to follow). Aside from that, the plot is well-structured, and it's especially refreshing to see that every battle presents new problems and situations that make things unpredictable and more intense. Characters are given diligent attention; they are colorful, but they also show some decent depth and emotion.This film utilizes decent photography and editing. Acting has been criticized for being really silly, but it matches up really well with the film's overall tone and style; it even goes so far as to reinforcing the film as a live-action anime. This production uses some very big-scale and highly imaginative sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is really cool too.Pacific Rim, finally, an epic movie that shows giant machines and giant beasts brawling and wreaking havoc. It's got the elements of classic kaiju monster films, robot anime, and maybe even a little hint of HP Lovecraft in the mix. It is exceptional for its worldbuilding, and I found it very immersive and impressive. However, if you're not captivated by this world, then you might just shrug it off as something silly. If you're taken by this film's concepts, then it comes heartily recommended.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

Transformers was an amazing movie. When it first came out, it was a blockbuster movie. Everyone was talking about it, everyone bought the toys, everyone couldn't wait for a sequel.For quite some time, Transformers was left unchallenged. I mean really, that movie has a cult following. To challenge it would be stupid. Or is it?Pacific Rim proves that Transformers does not monopolize the giant robot/action/CGI movie industry. When I first watched it, I noticed two things: (1) The storyline was very predictable (2) I didn't care about '(1)', because most of time my face looked like this -> =O or =DTransformers had the wow factor, but it is a kid's movie compared to Pacific Rim. But the main reason I'd rate this movie 9 stars is because it brought the whole "Godzilla" and "King Kong" monster movies back in to limelight. They made evil mindless giants destroying cities cool again.Whats even better, this time, we fight back with giants of our own. If you're like me, you've played games like "Mech Warrior" or "Gears of War", then you will definitely love this movie. The giant robots are controlled by humans, like the giant robots in "Power Rangers" but 1000 times cooler.In my opinion however, the main selling point of this movie is the fact that Guillermo del Toro really stretched the limits of his imagination this time, fusing the Eastern "Godzilla" with the Western "King Kong" and adding a pinch of "Alien", creating his "Kaiju". He reflects these monsters with the robots too,creating "Jaegers". The wow factor in this movie is definitely that, combined with the amazing graphics. The tacky lines like the part where Mako Mori says "For my family!" before slashing the Kaiju or the part where Raleigh says "We're out of options" when they had a blade they didn't use until halfway through the movie, may make you frown a little when watching it. But that's all it does. You just frown. A little. You're still going to enjoy the movie, it really doesn't change anything.Ultimately, this movie is definitely going to be a classic. It doesn't matter what you may think, it's a movie that people will watch again and again, just to watch some robots beat the crap out of monsters. It is in the same league as the legendary "Godzilla" and "King Kong", and Guillermo del Toro is indeed deserving of awards (which I am sure he will get) for creating such a masterpiece.He has indeed, done it again.

This movie had it all. Fresh faces, bleeping awesome cast, bleeping awesome effects, giant bleeping monsters, bleeping big a** robots, Ron BLEEPING Perlman and almost no cheese. It grabbed my attention all the way from start to finish. All cast members played their parts very well and I don't ever recall hearing any cheesy one liners at any point during the movie, which is a bonus.I only give it a 9 as I don't believe in perfection and the end left me wanting more. More robots, more monsters, more action and what comes next? It does, however, have everything needed to make a great bleeping movie.

The Pacific Rim 2013 Movie is an American sci-fi film directed by Guillermo del Toro, written by del Toro and Travis Beacham which stars Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Rob Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman aka Hellboy:D and the film is set in the 2020s, when Earth is under attack by Kaiju, a colossal monsters which have emerged from a portal on the ocean floor. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, a gigantic humanoid mecha each controlled by two pilots whose minds are joined by a neural bridge. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket who is a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori in a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju and save the Earth from the apocalypse. http://goo.gl/M82KS

The reason i go to the movies is to enter, just for a few minutes, in a world that we cannot see in real life. The giant monsters seen in the Sinbad movies, Godzilla, Gamera and other movies made my youth so much better. Years later the world became more cynic, and the cinema followed the same. Lost were the fun of yesterday and only the original Jurassic Park kept the spirit of the genre alive. Fast forward 20 years later, and Guillermo del Toro made a film almost impossible: a giant monsters vs giant robots with a heart (i.e.: not Transformers). I hope it inspire the same level of awe to a new generation of children, and ignite a wave of quality monster movies. With Godzilla just a year away, Pacific Rim is the best entertaining you can get until the king of the monsters movie next year. Not perfect but close enough, a sequel could only be better.

If you're an animé fan (Japanese animation), then this is the movie for you!I came to the movie theater with a mindset that I am a kid again -- ready to fight Ultraman-Evangelion-Samurai X style -- something like that. Although, I am actually a kid in an adult's body. LOL.I was not disappointed with this movie. The movie was honest. It did not feel forced like the Transformers movies. I've seen del Toro's past work, e.g. Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy movies. I liked those movies of his, and especially this new one. It was big! Big concept with big action sequences -- and it delivered! This movie would make you wish you've seen it when you were in elementary! Prepare for some Ultraman-Gundam-Godzilla nostalgia!I hope Pacific Rim succeeds in the box office. It's a big, ambitious, original movie which pays tribute to the classic anime/comic book greats. Hollywood is currently obsessed with DC/Marvel superhero movies. We need more original movies like this that does not have Batman, Spider-man, or Iron Man in it's title as it's selling point.Guillermo del Toro deserves some huge credit!10/10

The opening of the movie promised something special. The sum of its parts was a repetitive, boring and incredibly dull comedy. Fight scene after fight scene was metal monsters punching other monsters and occasionally shooting some high tech weapons. The acting was on a par with starship troopers and the scenes of the heroes being clapped by thronging workers on their return from missions was pathetic. As for the two scientists, were they supposed to be funny while the world was getting annihilated? I loved the scene where crowds were thronging to get into shelters and many were still carrying their umbrellas to protect them from the rain as skyscrapers were falling down around them, lol Sure there were some interesting special effects, but on the whole this was either pure comedy or a load of trash.

I saw "Pacific Rim", starring Charlie Hunnam-Sons of Anarchy-t.v., The Ledge; Idris Elba-Thor, The Losers; Rinko Kikuchi-At River's Edge, Sideways; Charlie Day-It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia-t.v., Horrible Bosses and Ron Perlman-Sons of Anarchy-t.v., the Hellboy movies.This is a monsters versus giant robots movie that is directed by Guillermo del Toro-Pan's Labyrinth, the Hellboy movies. It reminded me of the old Japanese Godzilla movies that I used to watch, as a kid. Basically, it's a big budget "B" movie-Godzilla meets the Transformers, only there is more than just one Godzilla. The story takes place in the not too distant future-about 10 years from now-where a dimensional rift to an alien world has opened up a portal in our Pacific Ocean. The aliens are dinosaur-looking creatures that come through the portal, only a few at a time-as the years go by, they come more frequently. The governments of the world pool their resources and come up with giant robots, as a line of defense. The robots use two bonded pilots that are usually brothers or father & son, because it's easier to handle the robots. Charlie H is a veteran pilot, Idris is the boss of the robot program and Rinko is a new rookie pilot that teams up with Charlie H after he looses his brother in an earlier battle. Charlie D is a genius scientist-you have to have at least one of those-and Ron is a black market dealer that deals in alien body parts-he scavenges the bodies after fights and sells them. About one minute into the end credits, there is a scene that you should see. The movie is also being shown in 3D and IMAX 3D-that's what I saw it in. It's rated "PG-13" for the violence and brief language and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes. If you like giant monsters fighting giant robots, then you should like this one. I enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.

Seeing this maybe one of the most fun times I've ever had watching anything. Made with an obvious and beautifully apparent love for movie-making and entertainment, this film kicks down the door and strides onto the screen with such bravado and comfort in its substance and nature that I can see no way to dislike it. Yes, the plot is goddamn ridiculous at times. Yes, it's a little over-the-top at times. But you know what? That's beautiful. And we need more of that in our lives. A little unburdened fun is something we all could use, and this film delivers heaps upon heaps of unburdened fun. Let us not forget, though, that it is not all giant-robots-punching- giant-aliens in every scene (welcome though those incredible scenes are). No, this film is just as much story and characters than it is style and action. The identities of the main characters in this film are some of the most appropriately portrayed I have seen from the action/sci-fi genre in a long time. It's not a character drama, so not too much must be read into and there isn't too much weight or seriousness to the more calm parts of the story, creating a few meaningful plot points, which is perfectly enough to satisfy even the viewer who is suspicious of massive films like this lacking any plot whatsoever (and I have been accused of being one of these). I can't say exactly how I felt when it finished, but I was content with its conclusion, (though it was a tad sudden), and I was delighted that I'd taken in this film. Mr. Del Toro, you're a masterful entertainer and filmmaker, and thank you for creating a film that can stand up, be confident in its massive substance, and strive to entertain and create a good time. Because above all else, if you still need a reason to see it, Pacific Rim can guarantee a real goddamn good time at the movies.

I read the comments about the thin plot, but I still wanted to see it. Sadly, the massive robots and decent cgi were not enough. Here are my points in addition to the multitude of plot holes already mentioned.The pacing is off. They did not flesh out the five years during which he was gone so that the movie continuously built to the climax without allowing space for the audience to make a connection to the characters - All the monsters look the same. Clones was a cheap excuse and it made the fight scenes indistinct.Plot: they never explained why they don't just nuke the monsters, especially if they can track them from the portal.Poor climax. When the credits rolled, I had a hard time leaving. The climax had no tension and left you feeling like there should have been more.a poor jab at the studios on my dime. I'm fairly sure the references to defecation (title, lighting, double event..., portal, etc) where intentional. Sure Hollywood makes crap movies, but this was a wasted opportunity to make a better one.

Granted, I did not have much information about this movie prior to seeing it last week at an advanced screening. Some crazy action stuff that may be hard to believe, but if you just think Die Hard in the White House and just enjoy the movie for what it is, a good action flick that you can enjoy. Great villain who people cheered when he got killed. Good effects and great job by the cast, Gerard Butler got to be a badass and keeps the movie enjoyable. A lot of the stuff away from the White House felt a little flat and Morgan Freeman feels a little underutilized with this role, but overall I think the movie keeps a decent pace. While it doesn't bring anything really new or groundbreaking but still enjoyable and entertaining and worth seeing. I think that using North Korean terrorists was a different change of pace that was noticeable. Flawed but hadly unwatchable. Think of the first Die Hard movie where Bruce Willis kicked ass and you will enjoy it.

Seen it in advance premier earlier today.I found it a nice action movie to spend the afternoon with some pizza and friends. Nothing more than that though. The plot is the usual terrorist attack and the usual hero that saves the day. The only original feature is that it all happens inside the White House. Some details in the plot could be more realistic. And parts of it I found strangely predictable. Still loads of people in the cinema applauded at several points and I felt inclined to join (never did though). I liked the bad guy. He was a no nonsense bad guy that I wanted to beat up. That means that his acting was good. The before mentioned applaud was at that point.Boys are gonna watch it because its a nice action movie with loads of fights/shooting/killing/guns etc. Girls are gonna watch it because of Gerald Buttler (according to the female friend that accompanied me to the screening)Nevertheless both should feel satisfied at the end of the movie... or was it the pizza...?? oh well...

If you're looking for an action film straight out of the 90's but stuck in the present day, you'll arrive at Olympus Has Fallen. We're initially led to believe that this might offer a story of personal redemption, when it's in fact a rudimentary action flick with little purpose beyond entertaining the regular American viewer. There's nothing wrong with offering a film such as this, so long as its entertaining. And, thankfully, Olympus Has Fallen offers enough enjoyable and compelling moments to keep its viewers watching with some degree of interest. No, the characters are not compelling and far from fully developed, and that's not necessarily the point. The point here is to keep the audience entertained and occupied, which is done sufficiently, if in an inconsistently effective manner. Gerard Butler does what he has to, being the fairly routine action hero a la John McClane, which is a bit of a shame since the opening act alludes to so much more. But by the second half, just about all potential for actual exploration is cast aside. Aaron Eckhart is a likable actor in all of his performances, even in one as underplayed as this. There's also a potentially strong predicament foreshadowed early on that could've been utilized to give the film a great edge, but it's ultimately abandoned for the routine action movie wrap-up. Meanwhile, everyone's favorite key player, Morgan Freeman, really seems bored in each scene, as if he's only there to occupy the cameraman's attention.As you can probably guess, both the plot and characters are thin, with only implied potential separating the key players from even more routine movies (which isn't saying much). The action and tension are where Olympus Has Fallen is left to shine, which it does during the time is plays. Looking back, however, it's far easier to pick the movie apart. You'll be entertained while watching it, but left banging your head shortly after leaving the theater.Given the lackluster stream of movies released so far this year, Olympus Has Fallen is able to make enough room for itself. Taken into account with other action films, however, there's little (if anything) to truly make it stand out. There's a sense of identity crisis here, as the film is more or less lost in another time period and suggests more than it delivers. For my money, it's decent popcorn entertainment, but not much else.

As shown in the trailer the attack on white house sequence is worthy to be seen from the initial setup to the entire process really reminds me Die Hard or Con Air. The movie is purely action thriller, no more, no less. Only gripe is the horrible spoken Korean by terrorists and their lines are just god awful beyond laughable level. Otherwise, main casts are solid and good amount of spectacular action scenes keep the pace going till the end. The script is very plain if it wasn't for the decent direction and editing, it barely passes the standard for dialogs. But some action scenes might be too much for certain tastes, its rated R after all. Some CG were pretty blend worse than the video games in today's standards.

What do you call a movie that borrows and steals (no begging because "the United States does not negotiate with terrorists") bits and pieces and even huge chunks from great action movies from the 1980s and 1990s? Try OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN. Alternatively, a fitting title would have been HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN and by that I am not just referring to director Antoine Fuqua.From its opening scene of the American flag fluttering to the last scene of the American flag fluttering, the narrative is nothing but a brutal illustration of a song all Americans hold dear – The Star Spangled Banner. It's one thing to be patriotic while injecting moderate dosages of propaganda (think ZERO DARK THIRTY). But what do you call propaganda that goes pro bono? As Fuqua and his newly recruited screenwriters have aptly called it: OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN. Moving up the ranks from a two-faced politician in THE DARK KNIGHT to the President of the United States, Aaron Eckhart's President Benjamin Asher loses his wife during Christmas (Ashley Judd as First Lady Margaret Asher) in a freakish turn of events that not even NASA or NORAD or the NSA saw coming. Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) confines himself to a world of guilt even though he did the best he could to save the First Lady. But Lo and behold! Banning's chance at redemption comes knocking, actually thundering through the air when The White House comes under siege by Korean terrorists. As the whole world watches in horror (because the most powerful man on Earth is held hostage in the most protected building on Earth) only one man will risk his life to prove a point; everyone else risking their lives will die because they don't have anything to prove.Seen this movie before? Once upon a time not too long ago, German terrorists hijacked the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles during a Christmas party. Little did they know that they would be dealing with a stubborn cop that wouldn't quit nosing around. But 25 years later and after the abysmal DIE HARD 5, it's time John McClane stepped aside, making way for Mike Banning – a Secret Agent cum Special Forces operative cum one man army who has main antagonist Kang (Rick Yune) eating kimchee out of his hands in no time. Why Korea? Now that ZERO DARK THIRTY director Kathryn Bigelow has tagged and bagged Osama bin Laden's big toe, who will the mighty US war machine trains its sights on? New enemies of course! ARGO made the Iranians look like fools. RED DAWN was remade, if anything, to point a finger at North Korea. And so the show of force continues on why the United States will never have to negotiate with terrorists.From having made memorable political thrillers like TRAINING DAY and SHOOTER, Fuqua falls flat with this ridiculously unrealistic action romp that also happens to be the most predictable movie yet. Morgan Freeman takes over as the acting President and then uses his documentary styled narration to spice up every dialogue with an exclamation. And since Freeman is in the movie Judd tags along for the ride like peas in a pod. Then there is Dylan McDermott in another very badly written role where you end up wondering what's the point of his character in the first place. As far as the action goes, there is plenty of mayhem and bloodletting with bombs bursting in the air and rockets going out in a red glare. But even after all the expended firepower that gives the White House a Swiss cheese makeover, Fuqua doesn't measure up to Roland Emmerich's panache for obliterating the White House (INDEPENDENCE DAY and 2012). Speaking of which, we may have to watch this movie again come summer 2013 as Emmerich has taken the liberty to simply call it WHITE HOUSE DOWN. Go figure! Where Fuqua gets it right is in the final scene. The message is more modest than forced and it acknowledges that years of continues war has brought America down on her knees. That her former glory and might awaits and will continue to be the 'Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave' as long as her children come together, differences aside, and begin rebuilding the nation. God bless America!

The making of this film was inevitable as "Under Siege" or other far fetched scenarios requiring the lone cop/soldier/secret service hero to save the day. Oddly, I happened to watch a recent set of episodes of the TV show "24" where commandos take over the White House. Without question there was better direction, action, acting, and more intelligent story. One even questions if the budget was better for the TV show. Not a single CG effect in "Olympus Has Fallen" looks believable. They all have this painted look, not even close to photo-realistic. Especially bad were the shots of the exterior of the White House. At times looking obviously computer fake, other times looking model fake.One of the biggest failures was to make our group of villains memorable. Frankly our hero Gerard Butler is pretty bland too. Morgan Freeman as the de facto Commander in Chief helps save the gravitas, but even he has to say some dumb stuff. Aaron Eckhart as the president never actually acts like one. The Secretary of State goes through a comical showdown with the bad guy. With all the setup in the first act about the intricacies of the security of the White House, and the hero's camaraderie with the President's son, you would expect some better payoff. Heck, the boxing ability of the President had some potential for some mano-a-mano but no.I sensed a bit too much schmaltz in the production. Where the pacing and story should have been Bourne lean and frenetic, the pacing stops for a chat with the wife, or a story with the kid. Then comes the cliché heroic music stings that are heard one too many times. I also found it strange how much blood seemed to be required in almost every shot. Even though the film fulfills the action quota, it has no business clocking in at almost two hours. Even when they try to up the stakes with nuclear Armageddon, you would rather there was a bit more pizzaz when it comes to the pacing and the character clashes, than the illogic of the premise.Another drawback is the lack of scope. Stuck in a drab house, even if it is THE White House, all the action takes place amidst hallways and ordinary rooms. Most of the guns and knives fighting seem run-of-the-mill. A better script would follow the "24" story evolution as the plot turns from a White House takeover to perhaps a chase to hunt down the perpetrators. Or better characters spelling out the intrigue and ramifications. Angela Bassett seems to have nothing to do. Compare that to Joan Allen's character in "Bourne Supremacy", she propels the urgency of the situation as her character is scrutinised. Maybe since Bassett is the head of the Secret Service, she tries to sniff out the mole.Too much is left on the sidelines that could have made this more of a smart thriller. It isn't enough to be just "Die Hard in the White House" these days.

I find it ironic that Gerard Butler, a Scotsman, as disgraced Secret Agent Mike Banning, embodies the spirit of John McClane much more than Bruce Willis did in that last dreadful outing. If anything, Butler has done nothing more than to cement his reputation as a bankable and likable action hero for the new generation in this old-school action movie. He has a commanding presence on-screen, quips wisecracks, bleeds when it's crucial, and dispatches the bad guys in a methodical cross between Jason Bourne and John Rambo. Not even the fine supporting cast (Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Melissa Leo, Dylan McDermott) can take away Butler's limelight.Indeed, Antoine Fuqua's "Olympus Has Fallen" is not only terrific entertainment but a terrific throwback to the pivotal 90's action movie, the Die Hard clone - and this film ("Die Hard" in the White House) is another reminder of why the trusted formula works, even if it has been dormant for nearly two decades (the last good big one being Peter Hyams' "Sudden Death").From the moment the film's main action start, the film doesn't stop running. The bad guys, hoo boy do they mean business. Rarely, if at all, have I seen this much brutal collateral damage in an American action film. Americans citizens get mowed down by bullets from ground and air forces. The all-American (Scottish) hero represents freedom and justice, and the bad guys represent every American's worst nightmare. I haven't seen this much political incorrectness since "The Delta Force". Having said that, Rick Yune surprisingly makes for an effective and nasty villain, who is relentlessly cold, smug and procedural in his mission, following the formula perfectly. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.It's fast, it's loud, it's preposterous, and yet I enjoyed every minute of it. The film is chock-full of sensational and well-shot action sequences/special effects, but its biggest strength is its cohesion. From start to finish the plot moves smoothly, and you can tell who the good guys and the bad guys are. The characters are established, their motives clear, and that's that. The action sequences do not simply skip to each other, they flow perfectly like a stream, thanks to crisp editing. Simplicity is key here, and convoluted plots do not fit in the formula (hear that, "Die Hard 5"?)Fuqua is no stranger to action, having helmed the solid "Shooter" six years ago. Here he ratchets up the action up to a 10 (CGI is present but used reasonably), and he remarkably doesn't hold back on the tension. It's no "Training Day", but it more or less hearkens back to an Antoine Fuqua who made "The Replacement Killers". Just thrilling fun.Of course the plot isn't original. It's a genre picture, and what I pay to see in a genre picture is its skillful craft and cohesive plot. This film has both, and resurrects the Die Hard clone from the grave. Here I thought I was getting bored of action movies. The genre is dying, you say? Here's a solid kicker.

This movie is telling us the White House is easy to be breached, all Americans are stupid, only one British secret service agent is smart, and the President's son isn't brain dead as his father.It may look like an all star movie, but due to it's poor story hence it's a total waste of good actors such as Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassett, and Robert Forster. There's not much for them to act!I'll be more intrigued if the war is started by the North Korea, come on, please be more realistic. We all know someday the North Koreans will start a new war. Why there's no one got the balls to make one good movie about it?Some CGIs are good, but the White House looked fake.

I'm not exactly what you'd call an action movie fan but I had enjoyed Expendables 2 when it hit the cinemas. The difference between a good action movie and a mediocre one is that the former contains well- developed, understated characters that don't beg you (the audience) for attention. "Show, not tell" is the most important lesson they teach you in drama school, unfortunately too many movie-makers ignore these basics thus, driving their entire plot into clichéd territory. Whereas Expendables 2 made a strong impression due to deadly performances by French-accented Jean Claude Van Damme and Jason Statham, Olympus has fallen fails to make the mark despite some edge-of-the-seat excitement and a brilliant storyline. It's nice to have ceaseless gunfire, helicopter attacks and rogue nukes all over the screen but they should remain in the backdrop.I repeat, NOTHING can replace method acting, especially when you have a cast like Aaron Eckhart (Thank you for Smoking), Morgan Freeman and Gerard Butler. Freeman looked tired and bored whereas Butler was too busy being badass, his character didn't come alive despite being portrayed as a one-man demolition machine. But, he still has a few cheeky one-liner moments against the Korean villain Kang and the United States government, but don't you see, anyone in that situation would have reacted with the same sense of humour. A lot of dialogue writers need to be fired for lacking imagination, and for making me yawn!

this movie is a masterpiece and a work of art. the action just keeps coming and the plot is believable. this has become my favorite movie of all time.the characters come to life. I must warn you all, however, that there are extreme images of violence against women. however, if you are a fan of explosions, shooting,and hard core fight scenes, then this movie with an all star cast is for you. I give this movie 10 stars out of ten rating, because it deserves it. it could possibly be the best movie of the year, or even the decade. the protagonist, Gerard Butler, shines in his best role yet.some of the parts were predictable, but to have a movie about America falling to terrorists in American markets, without a bit of hero action predictability, would more than likely not bet met with such enthusiasm in America. then again you always want to see the hero win over the bad guy. Gerard Butler does this with class and style. you get the good guy with the bad attitude approach. he even tells off the acting president.(spoiler alert!)***I was sad to see Ashley Judd die so early on in the film. Aaron Eckhart too is in his best role yet. Morgan Freeman was a huge let down, but the rest of the stars carried him nicely. I was very disappointed with Mr. Freeman's performance.watching the American flag fall and the white house explode was the best part for me. It was so beautiful it brought tears to my eyes of happiness. the antagonist of the film was superb. he was ruthless and calculating. the special effects are top notch and it looked so real.all in all this film is a true must see masterpiece. it has it's moments of downfall, as any film will, but they recover nicely from these faults and the action packed plot keeps you engaged.

Olympus Has Fallen sets the tone in the opening scenes by letting the audience know that the leading man(Gerard Butler)is a secret service agent who at all times puts country first before any personal feelings. So right away you know that in the end the bad guys aren't going to stand a chance against a true American patriot like agent Mike Banning. Gerard Butler plays the part very, very well and is quite good as an action hero. You find yourself really rooting for him to succeed in saving America from even more tragedy than what has already occurred. Ashley Judd has a small part as the warm and loving First Lady and mother of the President's son Connor(Finley Jacobsen). Aaron Eckhart is solid as the President of the United States and Rick Yune plays the part of the North Korean terrorist bent on destroying America "to a T". Last but not least, Morgan Freeman is Speaker of the House Martin Trumbull who assumes the Presidency while the President is held captive.Olympus Has Fallen has a solid plot, and you hope that God forbid a scenario like this could never happen in real life. The action and the special effects are fantastic. You are engrossed in this movie from start to finish, it delivers as promised.As I sat there and enjoyed this movie, a thought came to mind. If Morgan Freeman were to really run for President of the United States, he might actually get a lot of votes. He's played a President twice that I know of and has played other political leaders in various other movies. He's quite believable in the part. Just a thought.Olympus Has Fallen is a great movie and I would highly recommend seeing it!

I walked into his movie expecting a straightforward bloody action movie with a determined hero, and that's pretty much what I got. Gerard Butler plays a U.S. special forces agent who is forced to stop a group of Korean terrorists who attack the White House and kidnap the president, played by Aaron Eckhart. The U.S. government must formulate a plan to stop them before it is too late (not spoiling). It is clear from the get-go that these terrorists mean business and that gives you a sense of dread as they attack and kill innocent people.Not to sound morbid, but the attack on the White House is a fantastic scene (although it is unclear just how these terrorists got so close in the first place). There are lots of explosions that would make Michael Bay proud, although the CGI is a bit shaky. There are also at least 5 shots of the U.S. flag waving prominently. I was on edge through that entire scene. Gerard Butler is a bad-ass here. He knows his mission and is determined to succeed. He is very reminiscent of Bruce Willis in Die Hard and Liam Neeson from Taken. The way these terrorists act, you will end up rooting for him. Aaron Eckhart plays the president and he plays it just fine. Morgan Freeman plays the Speaker of the House and most of the time he looks like he is extremely stressed out (in real life). The move is pretty straightforward, but it works. If you can suspend your disbelief it is a pretty fun ride. The movie is very bloody and violent and there are a LOT of head-shots. There is some genuinely funny dialogue and one-liners delivered by Butler that had the audience giggling and that should be enough to keep you going.Now some negative things: the movie is derivative of several others, most notably Die Hard, Taken, and Rambo. Nothing very original here. The acting is a little on the stale side for the most part, the score is overly dramatic at times, like it's trying to make you feel emotion, and the CGI explosions look downright fake at times.In the end this is a fun popcorn movie with an patriotic flavor. Although it's not the least bit original, you will come out of it loving America at least a little bit more.

If I was a critic I would have written this movie off. Saying that its just one of those movies with the same old plot with a bit modification. This is true, but as an audience I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.The best thing about this movie is its pace. You won't know how fast the 110 minutes go. There's not a minute you feel bored. The attack sequences are bit over the top, but if you are a drama lover, you won't be disappointed. The storyline isn't much to think about but the screenplay is apt. Its a good thing that the director Antonie Fuqua keeps things simple, doesn't dig too much into the conspiracy stuff and also doesn't include any unnecessary twists.Gerard Butler does what he does best, fight bad guys. Aaron Eckhart as the stern faced president reminds you of Harvey Dent. Morgan Freeman probably is there to strengthen the star value in the film. But its the villain Rick Yune with his evil smile who impresses.This is an out and out entertainer, don't think too much, just be in the moment and watch this movie.

To the casual untrained eye it would seem that director Antoine Fuqua's film Olympus Has Fallen is just a generic thriller that adopts the basics of the Die Hard formula, or rather an Air Force One filled with laughable special effects and unashamed borrowing of superior cinematic products. However, the entire film is an incredibly poetic allegory of Fuqua's career itself alluding to the promise of creative potential that succumbed to overtly insipid storytelling dependent on mindless distractions. Coming onto the scene with great promise through his gritty police drama Training Day it seems Fuqua's career has been falling at a steady pace ever since with each film under his tutelage getting far more ridiculous and far more unrealistic. The devolution of realism can be seen through Fuqua's filmography as he moved from shallow war drama (Tears of the Sun) to illogical conspiracy political thriller (Shooter) to the White House hostage takeover in Olympus Has Fallen. Olympus Has Fallen is beyond absurd and despite some tenuously directed sequences coupled with a surprisingly admirable yet failed attempt at being charismatic from Gerard Butler the film plummets in a downward spiral filled with preposterous setups, brainless dialogue, and over the top violence all on par with a Steven Seagal straight to DVD release. There is plenty of manipulative flag-waving here and it becomes so forceful that you begin to think you're watching the American equivalent of Leni Reifenstahl's Triumph of the Will but in action movie form. Despite having some promise to his career it seems that Fuqua has become Olympus and he has fallen incredibly hard with little to no hope of standing up again. Action junkies will be more than pleased with the adrenaline infused Olympus Has Fallen but that isn't enough to separate it from the other forgettable action frenzied flicks that regularly make their way to the theaters. If you're itching for an improbable, monotonous, and violent piece of manipulative propaganda filled to the brim with action distractions then Olympus Has Fallen is your kind of film but all others should just avoid it all together. It's too bad there isn't a tactical team that could save Fuqua from plummeting further away from his potential talent and keep him from wasting opportunities.Read more here: http://wp.me/py8op-wR Other reviews: generationfilm.net

Mike Banning is a new American Hero! Great movie, well cast, Aaron Eckart does good job as President, Morgan Freeman as Speaker of the House. Gerard Butler as Mike Banning aka Mr. Badass, and even the Asian bad guy was well cast. The movie was well scripted, entertaining, great action scenes, plot keeps you entertained and wanting to find out more, great one liners, and a true patriotic American ending where the whole audience clapped once the bad guy was killed and at the end of the film. Overall Olympus has fallen is a great movie! The only downside would be the script is a little bland but the movie's well makes up for that and it makes it a very enjoyable two hours. It's by far the new Die Hard, great job by the director and Gerard Butler was great, true American Patriot Mike Banning is the Man, the next John McClane! He's a true American Hero!

I was wondering the other day if it's possible to find a review of this movie that does not mention the words Die Hard. Seems that the comparison is inevitable and it seems that Olympus Has Fallen is begging for a comparison. In fact, perhaps it's an homage to that action franchise, as it's more akin to the spirit of the original Die hard movie than its official sequel.If you've seen the trailer, then you'll know the plot. The White House is being attacked by a group of North Korean terrorists and hold the president hostage. As is with a lot of 90s action flicks, there is only one person who could save the day and that man is Mike Banning (Gerard Butler). The first ten minutes or so of exposition reveals a tragic event during his day as a Presidential guard. 18 months later, Banning is confined to a desk job and even as time passes he's still consumed with regret that he let his boss and friend, that is President Asher, down. So naturally, he's more than eager to redeem himself when the chance presented itself one sunny Summer day. The attack comes hard, fast and vicious. The first attack came from above, but instead of a space ship, practically the entire Washington DC is sprayed with bullets from an air carrier, and within minutes, the supposedly most secure building in the entire free world is reduced to rubble with dead bodies piling up on its grounds.The words fresh and original aren't likely to be associated with this film, but it certainly stays completely true to its title. Olympus indeed has fallen, and Antoine Fuqua doesn't pull any punches with the brutality of how it goes down. It's rated R for a reason, it's violent and bloody. I lost count how many people getting shot in the head at close range and all the severe stabbings. Banning himself has no qualms in *taking care* of the enemies. He seems to subscribe to the same "No mercy! No surrender!" motto as his most famous role in 300, but with a bit more humor thrown in. Some of the one-liners did deliver some laughs, especially his defiant quips at the Pentagon folks, though Butler's character not quite as charismatic as Bruce Willis' John McClane as the script lacks some serious wit.Unfortunately it's lacking in common sense as well. Granted, the believability factor depends on whether you'd believe a group of extreme terrorists could deliver such a blow to the United States. The thing is, I don't know how such a big aircraft could enter our airspace, passing through Andrew Air force Base, without being shot down? The security forces are so quickly rendered powerless it's as if they've never been trained to respond to emergency attack whatsoever. But the biggest plot blunder of all is how Banning is still able to get security clearance once he's inside the President's compound as he's technically no longer part of the Service. Yet could still use his thumb print to gain access, has the right code to open a safe, etc. as if he's never left! I mean, they didn't change authorization codes every time there's a shift in the security personnel? WOW, some *security* huh? Now, I can't possibly write this review and not mention the cheesy special effects. I get that this is a throwback to 90s action blockbuster, but do they have to throw in 90s SFX as well?? It gets distracting at times, especially during the ambush scene in broad daylight. Fortunately things get better and grittier as the day progresses, and the action gets more up-close with more hand-to-hand combat between Butler and whoever is unlucky enough to get in his way. Butler is utterly believable as a bad ass special forces, he's definitely credible in action flicks and as a one-man army. Yet he's not wooden or vacant like many action stars, he still brings a touch of humanity to the role as the mission is a personal one for his character. There's some emotional resonance in his scenes with Aaron Eckhart as the beleaguered POTUS, and also with his young son.The supporting cast are stellar but not really given much to do. We've seen Eckhart and Morgan Freeman in far better roles, but their presence did add gravitas to the project. Melissa Leo got more screen time than I though but I'm disappointed that the still-athletic Angela Bassett didn't get to do any butt-kicking in this movie! I was sure she would get to do some of that when she was cast as the head of Secret Service. Rick Yune pretty much rehashed his role as Bond villain in Die Another Day as the villainous mastermind Kang who's hellbent to get his hands on US nuclear missiles. I guess he's serviceable but nothing more, a far cry from the iconic performance of say, Hans Gruber, as Kang is neither menacing nor entertaining. I'd say the characters of Dylan McDermott and Radha Mitchell could've been left in the cutting room floor and they won't make a dent.The spirit of patriotism is so high in this movie, there's absolutely no room for subtlety. A torn down American flag being thrown by the bad guys from rooftops falls in slow-motion as a patriotic score comes on, there are plenty of moments like this and I can't help but feel a bit emotional despite its corny sentimentality.Despite all the flaws though, I still think this one is not a bad movie. In fact, it's actually quite entertaining and action fans should be pleased to see the relentless combat scenes and countless shootouts. There's also a decent level of suspense overall, and I definitely feel a pang in my gut seeing our leaders being violated in such a way. The subject matter of terrorism is sadly still relevant to this day, and at times it really hit close to home.

First, you know this film was pitched as "Die Hard in the White House." Yet, given that limitation, the film manages to avoid a number of pitfalls that have crept into the many lesser imitations of the first (and still best of them) "Die Hard." It's the characters in the film that keep it from being too much of a cartoon. The lead character, played by Butler, has had a fall a grace. In a more clichéd film, he'd be a broken, embittered alcoholic (e.g., Kevin Bacon in "The Following") who happens upon a chance for redemption and salvation. Instead, Butler's Secret Service agent is getting on with his life in a desk job, disappointed, anxious to be of more use, but not a shambling wreck of a human. He is a career professional, and when the events of the story take place, he reacts like a professional. The wisecracks are few (he doesn't "kill n' quip") and understated, which makes them more effective. Other characters have small touches (especially Melissa Leo) that make them distinctive and worth rooting for. A very welcome touch is the way the film-makers foil our expectations...they've seen many of the same movies, and rather than follow the cookie-cutter approach of bad scripts, they twist those situations to make them new and interesting.The action is well done and exciting. It's not a perfect film, but more than competent, continually engaging, and, in the highest praise I can offer, worth full price.

I have to say.... this year may be the hardest year for Die Hard fans because A Good Day To Die Hard just so bad and completely garbage maybe Olympus Has Fallen can heal Die Hard fans ups ?The Answer is yes ! Olympus Has Fallen got a lot of fun and satisfied action scene that you just think that " Hey it's should be like that in A Good Day To Die Hard " With Non-Stop Action , some epic scene that just make you so much fun at it.Gerard Butler finally makes the right decision here , He's just so bad- ass in this movie ! And he just fit perfectly in the role.But the things that drops the Olympus is almost everything in the movie just doesn't make sense even you're not the guy that watch a thousands of action movie , you can know that " Hey that's not making any sense.... "And The Casting , some actor are just not good... like Rick Yune he's try so hard to be such a bad guy that can kill everything in the world if it's necessary but unfortunately it doesn't work.... and Morgan Freeman in this movie he's just like the old man just sit there and doing nothing.But in the end the amount of satisfied you got is just good for wasting some of 2 hours of yours life to watch this movie rather than a completely garbage A Good Day To Die Hard .

Saw OHF last night at Big Newport on the big screen. If you're expecting an over the top "Die Hard" stunt fest peppered with dumb quips, be prepared to be pleasantly surprised. This is an efficient thriller designed to put you on the edge of your seat and keep you there till the very end. The assault on the WH was insane, with the same raw intensity of the first 20 minutes of "Saving Private Ryan". (And yes, the memories of 9/11 made it even more of a gut punch.) Fuqua is not pulling any punches. The violence is real and unvarnished. But lest you get pounded into submission, you have charismatic Gerard Butler story of redemption. That's where Creighton and Katrin Rothenberger's lean, taut, juggernaut of a screenplay does its job best. The stakes are high. And sh** gets real. Real fast. Butler is solid as the haunted former secret service stud taking the fight to the terrorists. . Morgan Freeman is great as the Speaker of the house who suddenly has the scariest job in the world. Angela Bassett keeps it real (and smokin hot) as head of the secret service. Rick Yune is believable as a cold-blooded shot-caller who could f*** Gerard Butler up. (His crew is scary.) Yes, it gets a little flag-wavey at the end, but that's forgivable. Lots of OMG moments, a few nervous laughs, all wrapped up in a human drama that'll make you feel good walking out.

How does a terrorist leader, long gone missing, know that a Secret Service Agent on Presidential detail has a wife who works as a nurse? Why would the same terrorist leader still keep the President alive when his only bargaining chip (the son) has gone and all nuclear codes have been obtained? How does a group of terrorists (with one looking totally out of place with long hair) masquerade as staff for the South Korean Premier and waltz into the most secure seat of power in the world without any credentials or background checks? How on earth are we supposed to believe that Aaron Eckhart is a President? How did Mike Banning believe that Forbes survived that brutal blitz on White House when his own mates died like puppets and still be the good guy? And what were they busy talking about when Forbes had a clear instruction to eliminate Banning? Why did artists of the caliber of Antoine Fuqua, Melissa Leo, Morgan Freeman, and Ashley Judd (the wisest of them all, decided to dropout after copping it in first sequence) sign on for this caper? Too many questions, too many plot holes. Olympus Has Fallen has a tremendous cast, but with such a terrible story-line, unbelievably woeful dialogue, one-dimensional screenplay (Mike Banning could be the Hulk, for all I care, he can escape anything), it is nowhere close to the class of a Die Hard or an AirForce One.There is the obligatory male-bonding boxing scene to state the mutual respect. Then, the haunted male hero with his nightmarish failure to save the First Lady consuming him. Then, we have the rising global threat of terrorism in the Far East. The mix is already potent and putrid. Add Gerard Butler's average acting and it just becomes worse. The only one to come out of this muddled mess with some credibility intact is Rick Yune, who portrays Kang with twisted sadism. The film needed a strong contrast to the hero and Yune provides it with sufficient panache, although his motive seems murky and unconvincing at best.Do yourself a favor and watch this when it comes on a boring TV Thursday night three years from today!

If you are looking for a perfect date-night movie, this is it! It has a wonderful romantic beginning and yet keeps the typical 'chick-flick' elements to a minimum. The action parts of it are as destructive as Independence Day. The plot may need a bit more, but amidst all this action, who really minds? Olympus Has Fallen has all the attraction of a 1990's action flick. When you see the other reviews of "Die Hard in the White House", believe them! I do wish to add, that Butler's role of that disgruntled agent doesn't really describe him well. It is more like Eastwood's In the Line of Fire- in that he has a redemption opportunity and then proves that he can be the hero. Butler's Mike Banning is indeed a composite of many action heroes from the 1990's, but that is why I, as a gal, liked this just as well as my husband did!

folks i was waiting for this movie for the last 3 months after i heard we were having a world premiere for a Gerald butler movie in India and to say the least this movie rocks without giving out any country's name it shows how heroes prove themselves and its awe inspiring . Gerald Butler is like ala WILL SMITH from Independence Day and Aaron Eckhart is ala Bill Pullman its a must watch it shows the President is human where he removes a friend from his detail because he feels he couldn't save his wife though he did his job.Special mention for Morgan Freeman and the scene to be seen is when Gerald chastises the American Military head calling him flash, Its a must watch folks especially in the big screen it made me remember Independence Day

In the original Die Hard film, which was great for its time, the setting was a high rise building in Downtown Los Angeles. The characters who were most vulnerable to a terrorist attack were the 20+ people enjoying a Christmas Party on one of the mid-level floors. Our hero, the one who would save his wife and the other hostages, is the unsuspecting John McClane, a New York City police officer with a bad boy attitude. Trying to top the first (and maybe even the second) Die Hard film is like trying to fly a plane through the Washington Monument, then crushing the White House. You simply couldn't ever do it.That is, until Antoine Fuqua grabbed onto the script for Olympus Has Fallen and shook his audiences with one of the most intense action scenes ever to take place on American soil. Imagine Red Dawn and multiply the realism of devastating an American city by 100 and you'll come close to experiencing what moviegoers witnessed at theaters during the opening weekend of Olympus.When I went out for a Saturday afternoon matinée, I'll admit that I was expecting a B-Grade film with corny acting and horrible lines. Olympus was anything but bad. Every time you expected to see an actor pull out a cliché, the characters had amazing restraint. Every time you expected a bad guy to show some unbelievable mercy, the good guys would mercilessly fall at the hands of a gruesome terrorist. And every time you expected the hero to say something goofy after killing a bad guy (trying to be like McClane), there was usually silence; allowing the audience to soak in the intensity of the slaughter. As part of that audience, I thoroughly enjoyed almost every aspect of this movie, despite having to suspend bits of reality that seemed to go away during the rush of storytelling.Normally, I check the time on my phone at some point during a movie (against all those rules that say keep your phone off), but with Olympus, I never looked one time. This was edge-of-your-seat entertainment that made the original Die Hard movie look like child's play.

These type of movies are the reason people flock to the theaters and fork out ten bucks for a ticket,a fun filled, action packed, and slightly humorous flick that won't leave audiences disappointed.It has been awhile since Gerard Butler has lead an action packed film on this level, and he certainly doesn't disappoint. His stunts and acting were great and The story of redemption plays out wonderfully and you are always rooting for Mike Banning(Butler) to succeed, Butler redeems himself as proves he still has the chops to lead a big action flick. But the credit of the success and level of action that made the film what it was, was Director Antoine Fuqua, his films always entertain and leave us at the end of our seats and this film certainly qualifies as one of his best films.The supporting cast helps amp up the level of intensity, Melissa Leo, you ma'am are a bad ass. Rick Yune, as always you are a handsome villain, maybe one day you can be on the good side and we will root for you instead of wanting you to bite it in the movie.All the elements cast, set, costumes, music, and SGI effects make this film awesome,although my only qualm is that I hope our Secret Service is better equipped and prepared in the event, that something like that should happen.

Loved the movie! It reminded me of the early "Die Hard" days, and was just as good as those movies were. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR KIDS. It is rated "R" for a reason. Olympus is extremely violent and bloody. I lost count of how many people were shot in the head or had their necks broken.I'm not a huge fan of Gerald Butler, but I thought he was excellent in this movie. Melissa Leo was amazing. I would have liked to see a little more of the relationship between the President's son and Gerard's character. I thought Angela Bassett was great, but under-utilized as was Ashley Judd. (Somebody give these ladies a lead role. They deserve it!) There's a lot to take in, and sometimes the writer and director ask you to believe some sort of silly things to make the movie work. Don't over think the film, just go along for the ride and enjoy it. I sure did.

Gerald Butler is amazing in this White House Invasion Action Movie. A very good movie that hits home, how important important our National Security and Defense are to our United States of America. This story and movie is pretty far fetched but we as a country saw in 2001 how something somewhat similar really happened. Overall the Action and Acting were Very Good. "Olympus Has Fallen" kept us on the edge of our seats waiting for Gerald Butler to come to the Rescue and he does in flying colors. And Morgan Freeman adds a lot of credibility in his supporting role. I'm so glad we picked this Movie to see over just another Animation Movie like "The Croods" Today.

This is by far the best action movie I have seen since the first Die Hard. When I went to this movie, I was not sure what to expect. Jake said it sounds like a tired formula. Well, as fate would have it, this was an improvement on the formula used in Die Hard. The bad guys were the Koreans in this movie. Gerard Butler, who is nothing short of a genius, delivered the goods. This movie had all the right components of a good action flick. There was a protagonist and an antagonist. There are several components that make a movie great. Movies are often more than just entertainment. If you can sit through a movie and believe they are set in a certain place, believe that the actors are not actors, then the movie has at least done part of a job. This movie does JUST THAT. The way the plane flew into the white house was amazing. I liked that button that the pilot pushed to make the missiles not hit them. What I was surprised about is that this is basically an instruction manual on the big screen. What is it an instruction manual for? How to take over the white house! I sure hope no bad guys watch this movie because there is a lot of stuff in this movie that the terrorists probably never knew how to do but now they do. I know a lot about The White House and the secret passageways. The president was played by Morgan Freeman who is nothing short of a genius when it comes to playing the president. He was actually the house speaker but was the temporary POTUS. I was surprised that Gerard only had one handgun and was able to get so far. Then again, this IS a movie. As a photographer, my favorite component is Cinematography. It is what is considered the visual beauty of the film. Many movies through out time have displayed great photography, whether it is of landscape, how a shot was made or sweeping camera angles. Often times this can make an average story a great movie. Olympus has fallen has some of the most amazing Cinematography ever! All in all, it really comes down to how the story is told - which is essentially all things combined. Olympus has Fallen is a great example that perfectly blends all together - all are above average as pieces, but combined - wow - it is a sweeping big screen picture as big as Morgan Freeman himself. Like I said, this movie was so good. I can't wait to see it on DVD. This is what screenwriters and directors should watch so that they can be inspired.

This movie is up there in the league of 'The Rock' with Nick Cage & Sean Connery and 'Air Force One' with Harrison Ford and Glenn Close, in terms of entertaining audience with a great plot, non-stop action from start to finish, and how the hero saves the day in the nick of time.I don't know why Gerard Butler spent more time doing romantic movies after the '300' when he could do very well in action-pack movies. I think Gerard Butler is a natural when it comes action movies. I don't like him in romantic movies.This will be a great blockbuster success and will be classic. Gerard Butler should make more movies like this, and he will make it big time.

You know the star of a movie has a stake in the production when he is listed as one of the producers. Gerard Butler served as one of four producers on the slam-bang, high-octane, "Die Hard" in the White House thriller "Olympus Has Fallen," with Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Aaron Eckhart, Dylan McDermott, and Rick Yune. "Training Day" director Antoine Fuqua and freshman scenarists Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt assemble the clichés as efficiently as the corpses pile up in this edge-of-the-seat nail-biter where nary a second of its two-hour running time is squandered. Squeamish moviegoers should shun this invigorating melodrama since our hero shows the villains about as much mercy as they do the scores of innocent bystanders that die from the hundreds of bullets and explosives that rock this R-rated actioneer. This is the kind of contagious movie where the audience spends more time staring at the screen than their illuminated cell phone menus. Surprisingly, most of the White House scenes were lensed on location in Louisiana rather than in the nation's capital. We will have to bide our time until late June when "Independence Day" helmer Roland Emmerich's similarly themed saga "White House Down," co-starring Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum, appears to know how which of these white-knuckled, geopolitical, hostage epic comes out on top. Meanwhile, "Olympus Has Fallen" qualifies as Gerard Butler's best film since his earlier hits "Law Abiding Citizen" (2009), "Gamer" (2009), "RocknRolla" (2007) and "300" (2006).

When thinking about a movie with a plot based on kidnapping of a U.S. president, "Air Force One" is probably the first one that comes to mind to most people. A better one, however, is an adaptation of Canadian self-taught literary man (and one-time Evangelist) Charles Templeton's "The kidnapping of the president" (1980). That movie is at least intelligent enough to base its plot on the fact that a U.S. president is entirely expendable. This is precisely how, and why, the system works. "Olympus", an absolute no-brainer, bases its plot on the laughable supposition that preserving the life of the U.S. president is top priority on everybody's mind. Other examples of mind-boggling absence of common sense are abundant, such as the gross incompetence of the U.S. national security, both in air and on ground. I don't know whether U.S. national security personnel would laugh or cry watching this movie. Probably both.The recompense, as mentioned, is director Antoine Fuqua's fully demonstrated ability to produce combat action sequences, from Medieval ("King Arthur", 2005) to modern day ("Tears of the sun", 2003).Perhaps coincidentally, but more likely not, two most-read film critics refer to the "Die Hard" franchise in their review of Olympus. There are sufficient similarities to support the validity of this view. Olympus, however, has a stronger cast which, unfortunately, goes to waste. Ashley Judd, as the President's wife killed within the first 15 minutes of the movie, picks up her paycheck and disappears thankfully quicker than you can say "Jack Robinson". Angela Bassett as the Secret Service Director blandly recites a few lines, leaving hardly any impression. Melissa Leo, who just recently questioned Denzel Washington quite effectively in "Flight", at least takes a heavy beating (literally) as the Secretary of Defense held as hostage together with both the President and Vice President. Radha Mitchell, as the protagonist's wife, looks heartbreakingly beautiful but her character is also heartbreakingly unnecessary. Morgan Freeman comes through best among the lot as the Speaker suddenly finds himself in an unenviable position of Acting President of the U.S., but that is only because he is Morgan Freeman. Aaron Eckhart, one of the best character-actors around, is all but wasted as the President, regularly grimacing his face in a way that it almost look like Harvey Dent in "The Dark Knight", AFTER losing half of his face. Finally, will Gerard Butler become the next-generation Bruce Willis? You decide. I've said more than enough, Just go for the superb action sequences but don't hope for anything else.

Critics are crying lack of originality. You might say a cheeseburger lacks originality but you'd go back to it if its well cooked. Same here. From the opening sequence - well crafted and nuanced - which sets up the theme for the rest of the movie to conclusion, yes it did feel like one long-take, maybe there ought to be some pauses or cut-aways, but overall it is a fast ride and gratifying and a cut above recent genre. There were few minor misses. I looked for Morgan Freeman to show his usual calm under duress but here he looked dejected. A departure. The main action hero agent whats his name did not displayed any sense of fear while playing in den of deadly foes who occupied the White House, he simply wondered around room to room, sat in the Oval Office and made calls. Hard to believe. Oh, the movie commits a major crime in killing off the first lady / the lovely and talented Ashley Judd within the first 10 minutes, that had me tearing my hair out. They could have used some pretty but no-name actress but not Ashley ?8 out of 10 for exciting action, realism and just sit back enjoy the show and don't ask too many questions.

...the producers and studio were wise not to advertise that this was another ANTOINE FUQUA film.... Had i known this going in i probably never would have bought a ticket... However, as the film faded to black, and i saw "DIRECTED BY.... Antoine Fuqua" i groaned out loud and shook my fist. Next time, Fuqua, NEXT TIME!!! I cannot believe that both Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman signed on for this garbage. I can only assume they needed the paycheque. Eckhart, to this point, had never let me down. Shame on you, Aaron!Gerard Butler...Boy there's a guy who really hasn't had a real winners since "300", eh? He really hams it up as Captain America-meets-John McClane... I guess he gives it the old college try but i don't think ANYONE could deliver those forced, wannabe-badass lines with a straight face. Don't get me started on the casting. Dylan Mcdermott? On what planet is Dylan McDermott ANY sort of imposing action figure?I give this movie a 5 (rather then the 3 i want to give to it) for Melissa Leo's performance. Never thought i'd see the day where i say something akin to "Melissa Leo steals this movie", but she really does.I understand the concept of the mindless action movie, i really do. But a real GOOD mindless action movie doesn't openly present plot holes a mile-wide that just stand there and scream at you!This movie was truly, truly awful. You've done it again, Antoine! Curse you.

There is a certain amount of disbelief that one must go through for most movies to be enjoyable for the reason it is meant to be enjoyed. I was ten items past the line 5 minutes into the main "taking over the white house" scene. After i made the decision to absolutely not look at the movie with any kind of authentic merit, the movie itself got much much...well, it was actually pretty silly the entire time. Good news is, the movie has lots of murder and brain stabbing. Also, there is a hilarious pledge of allegiance scene. Bad news is the plot and actions taken to get everything to the next stage were completely unbelievable, the writing was abysmal, and i think i have made the decision that i am done with CGI. Give me a death star model over the computer generated demolition of the washington monument any day. Sorry, but it doesn't look real and it takes me out of the picture. Rent it or get it on Netflix when it comes out and save your money.

The only good part was the first 20 minutes the rest has no real story, action... or even sense in the events. I can't believe Morgan Freeman agreed to do this movie... he has done so much better than this.The movie made me laugh of how bad it was. The music tracks were the only good thing about the movie.The acting was okay. The clothes was good. The graphics were okay.It is a complete disappointment.If you don't want to waste your money, please go watch a different movie. You will regret it.There were unnecessary scenes that could have been deleted and make the movie shorter to have a better effect. The movie had great actors and potential but it was not used correctly.

I gave this clunker a 2 out of 10 simply because Gerard Butler had a couple of funny lines among 110 minutes of clichéd dreck.Poorly written, plot was secondary to the crappy special effects. It failed as a drama, as an action flick and just wasn't bad enough to be campy, although it came close.I did spend a lot of time laughing at how bad it was, so maybe it did succeed as a comedy, albeit unintentionally. Even the model of the White House was laughable. Hate to tell you, I've never seen the White House shiny.I was disappointed that Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett would have made this movie. It was beneath them, even if it was just for the paycheck.

I actually saw this film about 4 hours after I saw "The Incredible Burt Wonderstone" and boy, was this better! I never really have been a Gerard Butler fan but I think he put his name in view of some important people with this film. He made his character believable, and did a great job in the role of the typical bad-ass who everyone's relying on. Let's be honest, Morgan Freeman was probably cast just to boost the lineup of the film, because they knew Gerard and Aaron weren't gonna be enough, but they really were! This movie had pretty much non-stop entertainment and pretty cool scenes. The only thing that caught me off guard was the very unsettling scenes of terroristic violence. The film was rated R for strong violence and language throughout. For those of you who want an action flick with minimally graphic violence, I ask you to proceed with caution. While this is nothing TOO unbearable in terms of violence, the MPAA rating is somewhat misleading, because all it says is "strong violence", which is terminology that the MPAA identifies with films not even half as violent. "Strong, brutal, bloody violence" would be more like it, just for those of you who are a little hesitant because of the violent content of this film. However, if you can see past it and are in the mood for a very well made, well scripted and nicely directed action flick, go ahead, do yourself a favor and see this movie. This isn't some insightful masterpiece, so don't over analyze, or try to see deeper into it, but take it for what it is, and that's just entertainment.

This is definitely not a documentary type of movie so if you're expecting for one, then skip this one. This has a lot of unrealistic things going and so if you are easily annoyed by those type of movies, you'll definitely hate this movie.To set a good base, recent movies I enjoyed above all others are: Transformers, Avatar, Battleship, Amazing Spiderman, Prometheus, etc... So if you liked most of those in the list, I will guarantee you that you will definitely like this movie too.This movie has a lot of far fetch happenings that definitely cannot and will not happen in the next century (if US stayed as superpower for that long).But, once in a while, we would like to play "what if's" in our heads. And this movie is really a good enjoyable entertaining attempt to answer your "What if the Whitehouse fell to the hands of the enemy?"

This film was surprisingly good. It's been a while since I've seen such an enjoyable action film like this one. Actually, I've been starving for one for quite some time. So much so that after being disappointed by crap like the first two Expendables, the Transformers sequels, the Total Recall remake, etc., I wanted to give this a 10. Of course, this film wasn't perfect but was still a very enjoyable film.As others have said, this was basically a Die Hard film in the White House. Actually, this should've been another Die Hard film. But don't hold this against it. It was very well done. In fact, it was better than some of the Die Hard movies themselves.The strengths of this film were the action (of course), the cast, the character development and the story. The action was graphic and realistic, the cast featured quality actors, the characters had enough depth to make us care about them and the story (though not original) did add more weight to the importance of what the protagonist needed to do. Add this all up and you had a film that had enough emotional impact to make you care about what happened, unlike many recent action films that seemed more like mindless video games than movies.What I really like was the depiction of the bad guys. They were clearly bad and proved they were not messing around. Repeatedly. It's just one more reason for you to pull for the good guy.Like many action films, this one wasn't very original. But what separated this from the others was that it was well executed and there were just so many things going for it that it didn't matter. Watch the Expendables and you'll appreciate this a lot more. This was one of the better action films in recent years.

Saturday Night Live won't have much trouble parodying this movie which had my friends and I grabbing our sides from the non-stop unintentional laughter it produced.From start to finish, almost every scene is laugh out loud funny. Most of the acting, save Freeman and Butler, is appalling. Though Ashley Judd is fine and, to her advantage, mercifully killed off a few minutes in to this laugh-fest. Bassett has absolutely nothing to do, except sit there looking like she's thinking, "Didn't anyone remember to write me some lines?" Foster plays the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs as if he's got dementia. "I know I put that code book somewhere." And one actor in the war room, I won't insult him by mentioning his name, so hilariously over acts throughout that you'll be reminded of Johnny from "Airplane." I was waiting for someone to ask him what kind of plane was attacking, to which he would reply, "Oh, it's a big pretty white plane with curtains in the windows and wheels and it looks like a big Tylenol." Then there's the plot. Really? There's a plot? Something about some evil vaguely North Korean villain from a Bond film and his American traitor pal wanting to punish America for its excesses and Wall Street and, I don't know. What I do know is, apparently, it takes the Marines 15 minutes to get to the White House when it's under siege. "Hey Brad, do we turn left on K street or Pennsylvania?" And it's fine for enemy planes to enter our restricted airspace since the $750 billion we spend on defense doesn't, apparently, account for any weapons capable of shooting down a single rogue aircraft.So, with the nation's Marines, Army, Air Force, Secret Service and capital city's police force unable to save us, we turn, as we so often do, to the efforts of a lone, down trodden hero. In this role, Butler saves the movie from completely devolving into a series of WTH moments. But, you half expect him to run into Bruce Willis along the way. "You go that way, I'll go this way, and I'll meet you at the bad guy's lair." Butler and Freeman do their best but Freeman looks to be wondering, "my god, who wrote this tripe?" Which brings us to the writing. Woody Allen couldn't have done it better, though he tried with "What's Up Tiger Lily." The dialog here made about as much sense. During the fight scenes you could almost hear them shouting, "Saracen pig! Spartan dog! Turkish Taffy." You do get the usual serving of clichés. Navy Seals approach the White House in helicopters. "Five minutes. I want a clean deployment." As opposed to what? The usual haphazard deployment? Then there's some beautiful Monty Python-esque comedic timing. Freeman is warned it's a trap but he won't abort the rescue operation. After five of the six helicopters are destroyed he hollers, "Abort!" Um, wait. You couldn't have given that order four helicopters ago? Melissa Leo, a terrific actress, terrifically miscast as a sort of drunken Secretary of Defense, tells the bad guy she'll never give up the codes. The president waits until she's been beaten near to death and then says, "I order you to give them the codes." She should have replied, "Now you say that?? Now?? Next time, how about you order me to give them the codes before they knock my teeth out?" And, about those codes. Apparently they'll blow up nuclear missiles across America turning our nation into a vast wasteland (small detail, self destructing the missiles would not set off a nuclear explosion). The bad guy is forcing the codes out of the three people he holds hostage. But he's good enough to force them out one every thirty minutes. A bad guy needs to build suspense.So, don't bother to bring your belief with you. You'll be suspending it so much, it's hardly worth the effort. Nothing in this movie approaches reality in any way shape or form. None of it could ever happen. But do bring your comedic improv skills, as hilarious bits will pop into your head from start to finish. Maybe even share some of them with the audience in Rocky Horror-like fashion. As a drama, I'd have rated this a zero. But, as a comedy, it gets a ten and that averages out to 5. It's funny as hell and, we should be grateful that Hollywood has finally turned out a terrific comedy for 2013, unintentional or not.

This movie was so full of objectionable depictions of America that I was astounded. The only redeeming quality in the entire movie was the character of Mike Banning who was a tough guy willing to do whatever was necessary to get the job done. I really appreciated that, and I suspect that our special forces and our secret service men and women are very similar (maybe not quite so over the top).Objections: Almost everyone else in the movie, from the men guarding the White House to the Speaker of the House were a bunch of mealy-mouthed weaklings with no policies with which to respond to a terrorist attack or a hostage situation. Our president is not our "Dear Leader" and the idea that our entire way of life would be threatened if our president was held hostage is utterly ridiculous. But what I hated most was the implication that the North Korean's have a legitimate gripe with us. North Korea is a country where one man dictates to the rest; where one citizen is of no value; where all men are equally worthless. They make no apologies for these principles, they make no apologies for the millions of citizens that have already starved to death, and they make no apologies for the millions of political prisoners who dared to speak out against the "Dear Leader". We in the USA, on the other hand, have adopted a different set of principles where each individual citizen is valuable and our entire government is (or at least was originally) designed to protect the rights of each individual. These principles have allowed us to flourish and prosper. The North Koreans (and other dictatorships) don't want to adopt similar principles -they could- but they don't want to. Instead, they want us to feel guilty and responsible when their people continue to starve and die. I don't buy it.I do realize this is a movie review and not a political forum, but the movie did try to make a political statement and I think it warrants an answer.

Olympus Has Fallen (2013) Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckard, Angela Bassett, Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Melissa Leo, Dylan McDermott, Rick Yune. Non-stop action and graphic violence means heart pounding thrills. The beginning sets up the First Family as loving parents to their young son, who is buddies with head Secret Service agent Mike Banning. So instead of Mike being in the car with the President, Mike goes in the car with Conner, the boy, who asks if he can. A horrible accident on the way from Camp David to the White House causes a death and Mike is blamed so is reassigned to desk work at the Treasury Dept. So when the attack on D.C. and the White House comes, Mike runs amid the chaos to the W.H. and by the time he gets there he is able to enter and find out the who, what, where of the people who have taken over the building. Since he has worked there and knows all the secret communications and passages, he is able to talk to the command center and those left in charge. He works his way toward the 'safe bunker' where the villains have set up shop and listed their demands. The scenes where he has to fight and kill his way toward his objective are graphic and bloody, but make you gasp and at times exclaim. Like other thrillers - Taken, for example - one extremely well trained guy is able to do the impossible. I am an older woman and I enjoyed the film and seeing Butler in action. The whole cast is very good, especially the three women in roles of importance to the story. 8/10

I am not going to give anything away in this review other than what you know from the trailer. The White House is attacked and how!! The action is raw and the plot is tense. There is not a boring movie in this movie. I've given it 10/10.Gerard Butler does a fantastic job as Secret Service agent Mike Banning and so do the other actors in this film. But Butler steals the show completely. The fight sequences are really good too with a lot of martial arts and weapons all over the place. This will keep you glued to your seats wanting to know what happens next. Agreed that it is in many ways a Die Hard clone, but I enjoyed this movie more than any of the Die Hard movies I've seen (I've seen all except Die Hard 4.0). Watch this excellent movie. You will not be disappointed!

If your willful suspension of disbelief is in good working order, "Olympus Has Fallen" is an excellent action flick. Gerard Butler plays a believable and compelling hero, hard-nosed and devoid of annoyances that limit most action stars. I hope he makes more movies with his Mike Banning character; I will go. Also, the first half hour is both highly dramatic and highly realistic, inspiring in me feelings I've not felt that intensely since 9/11. (PTSD warning!)The remainder stays dramatic and engaging, but realism slips. Fortunately, I was attached to the lead character and invested in the plot by that point, so I didn't give up. But I sure did a fair amount of whispered griping. By the time Morgan Freeman recalled the 7th fleet (Would! Not! Happen!), my girlfriend will attest that I was about ready to run up to the screen and strangle the president myself.Coming out of the theatre, I had mixed feelings. But dang it, I sure did feel like I'd just ridden a pretty good roller coaster! So I figured it out quick: Yes, because of the way it started, I thought this was gonna be a more serious take on the story concept. And the movie disappointed me in that regard. But I can enjoy a balls-out Schwarzenegger or Steven Seagal movie for what it is, and Gerard Butler is orders of magnitude better than those guys.Bottom line: I had fun!

I'd hate to see Gerald Butler turn into a Bruce Willis, Steven Segal type of actor... Gerard is better and more flexible than that. However, this movie at hand was excellently done, great special effects, storyline. We as Americans truly need to pay more attention to North Korea, they really are getting very serious as never before and this movie was ahead of it's time in regards to the subject matter. I think everyone associated with the movie should get a bonus. It's the best thing I've seen come out of Hollywood in a LONG TIME. Most of Hollywood movies have been nearly awful except for the cartoon type that attract the kids. They can't even make remakes good. I would like to see OZ in 3D though... I've never seen a 3D movie but OZ does appear to have the special effects to make it a good 3D movie.I'm so sick of vampire and zombie movies, Hollywood - get real.

An action-packed entertaining movie from start to end with the linings of notable star-cast such as Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Ashley Judd and Radha Mitchell. The trailer was quite promising which made me to go for the movie and I am glad to inform that I have no regrets watching this movie. It is one of the movies that would remind you of some of the other action flicks that you might have watched previously yet at the end it successfully makes its mark. However, despite the good performances by the lead characters such as Morgan Freeman, Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart; I could not help it but wish the latter had more things to do apart from being helpless in most of the scenes as his character was underplayed in my views. The plot is predictable though at most at least however I must admit the director was smart in packaging a-not-so-new-plot with a better delivery tactics. It comes with the blends of action, sense of patriotism, sentiments and just the right amount of humor. A good movie to spend your money on!

Honestly, I thought I was going to be disappointment with this movie, but I enjoyed it from beginning to the end. Not only was the action balanced throughout the movie well enough to keep the audience's attention, the cast was pretty great, especially those female hostages in the bunker. I was pretty freaked out at some scenes because it was so realistic.Not only is the action entertaining, but the humor that is incorporated in the film is well delivered and appreciated. I found myself laughing at almost all of the remarks that were said. My only complaint are the CG effects. At times I felt like I was watching a video game or something and that took away from the film a little bit, but it wasn't too distracting. Overall I felt like it was a solid action flick that is worth watching if you want to go to the movies with some friends or family.

On a lazy Sunday,if you are showered with oodles of action,entertainment n action again with more than even the ticket price, what else you want huh???!!! This is 1 great stuff, like a 110 min.race which will keep one gelled to his/her seats.. I mean right from the car crash which is brilliantly shot to the invasion of the "olympus",its a complete entertainer.. People may be having problem with the originality, but boy if the old formula is being delivered at your doorsteps with 100% cash back offer, would one deny one??? Watch it for the Scottish versatile(check out his p.s.i love u)Gerrard butler who delivers the punches n the punchlines with similar ease.. AAron as always his cool self, freeman has not much to deliver, simply adds to the star caste as does the gorgeous Ashley Judy.. Crux is Go watch this high octane, in your face violent flick.. Don't read the reviews though.P.S. Don't take your girl along, you cant enjoy both simultaneously.

The premise is that The President is captured and a lone agent, Banning (Gerard Butler) is left alone in The White House to try and rescue him. Now this premise didn't entice me enough to see the movie, but the casting of Morgan Freeman as the Speaker of the House did. I wasn't too interested in Gerard Butler, even though I thought he did a really good job in 300. And, Aaron Eckhart, while I thought he did a great job as Two-Faced in The Dark Knight, I was impartial to seeing him in any other roles. I was surprised to see Dylan McDermott (whom I had seen in American Horror Story) in the film. As I am not a fan of R-rated movies in particular, the violence at times was a bit graphic for me, but a lot of the time I felt was handled well with angles and cutting. The movie was appropriately lit and helped set the mood. The music was really good as well. It didn't define the mood but complimented it very well and never felt out of place.

The acting was OK, the special effects were fantastic, the story was absurd. Only Hollywood could come up with something this ridiculous.The premise is farcical and totally unbelievable. This is pure fantasy. I expect anyone with any military experience to get up and walk out. This is Hollywood bashing an inept US military all over again yet Hollywood can't get any of their facts right. Never mind reality, let's just make a fantastic shoot-em-up with lots of explosions and a big body count. The plot plays on public fear of nuclear bombs going off accidentally, but the story line is completely self-contradictory, it can but it can't.What bothers me is, unlike Jack the Giant Slayer, people might actually believe this nonsense. James Bond is at least semi-believable.

Olympus Has Fallen is a paint-by-numbers action film by Antoine Fuqua, a director who generally performs better behind the camera. Die Hard at the White House as its been referred to, is in the main, a humorless and very bloody action film with Gerard Butler as a Secret Service agent on a mission-to-redeem-himself, which entails lots of knifings and bullets to the brain of his faceless opponents. It's all very professional--and totally generic. Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassett and Melissa Leo are on hand to recite their lines and write their names on the back of a paycheck. This is a movie for people who have seen everything else at the cineplex but still feel the need to spend 2 hours in a darkened auditorium.

"Olympus Has Fallen" works because it is so real. Putting aside the bit of exaggeration and slight plot problems, the movie does a good job. It's otherwise easy to follow, and the acting conveys a true sense of fear. Perhaps I'm a bit bias being (arguably) Gerard Butler's greatest fan, but the acting by the President and Acting President fits perfect with the movie's tone.I love this action film because it is so real, and doesn't need fancy CGI or SFX to make it look good- it plays off the sense of fear we as Americans have. It really makes me angry when I read reviews that criticize its "R" rating and lack of "action" (which I highly disagree with, as the violence is convincing and the action COULD happen) because they fail to realize that a good movie plays off emotion, not fancy editing work.Also, I was sickened when people in the theater laughed at people's death and the slight bouts of humor (although, I giggled when Gerard described the day as just a rough day in the office. These humorous lines are defense mechanisms in real life, and keeping with the idea that this can happen makes laughter unthinkable. And just because we killed the bad guy (which there were way too many of in the film), doesn't mean we should laugh. Really, it's a human life... and really...a death in the context of this movie isn't funny. Sorry to rant, but this movie really shouldn't be filled with hefty belly laughs...Overall- great, real film with great, real acting and effects. It just goes a slight overboard (I feel) with the amount of terrorists there and the quickness (or sometimes lack) of response by others.

At first, I thought that I may not be doing enough justice to the movie and maybe comparing too much which Argo. However after some thinking, I realized that this movie is truly bizarre. The director and story writers did whatever they pleased to show some mindless action. But there are much better movies for that like die hard (this movie seems in fact an attempt to be Die Hard), mission impossible and James Bond movies which at least create those settings where one can still indulge in the action.I think the intent in this movie was to say that the entire US military and homeland security is a big failure run by an incompetent management throughout and there is only one savior to the White House who is a banished member of President's security team. Maybe I went to the movie with high hopes. Toning them to the rock bottom might help.PS: Ordinarily I would have given the movie 4 stars, but have deducted one star for wasting the talent of Morgan Freeman

What a rebound from that horrible disappointment in December that passed itself as thriller... Here is a film that delivers, has us caring for the good guys and hissing at the evil forces. There are plenty of explosions, twists and turns, and a leading man with a face, flaws, a heart, and a mission, and yes! there is suspension of disbelief, but it's been a while since we had a film was thrilling to watch, that didn't have looking at me watch or running outside to the bathroom or to text that I regretted spending my cash.The White House is attacked and half destroyed by an evil terrorist that has the world on the brink of destruction. Suddenly we have a worthy villain who recalls the bad guys from the James Bond thrillers, but there is more special effects, and in the middle of all the debris flying around, the sequence and cool editing actually make sense. Contrary to those Michael Bay films where things are blown up just because we have the budget, this one has bodies falling, buildings crumbling, but we actually hold our collective breath, as it looks like it just couldn't get any worse.We know we will be shocked when the First Lady is gone in the first ten minutes of the thriller, but we have no time to get over our shock as hell breaks loose outside, over, inside, and under Washington, D.C. Before we can say, what the..., Gerald Butler in his best impersonation of James Bond, Indiana Jones, a few Mission Impossible heroes, we have people being executed, children in danger, some cool technological moves, and in one of the best supporting entries of any year, Morgan Freeman as acting president. It's details like that makes one enjoy this film. The film is just fun to watch, and there's enough good acting not to regret this guilty pleasure.You know that in the end, things will be o.k., and there are plenty of clichés along the way, but when the mix is just right, the result is pretty enjoyable. There is going to be a sequel, and we want it soon, and as good as this one.

I took my girl friend and her sister to the Sunday Matinée. I didn't know what to expect. The poster shows the White House with flames shooting out of the West Wing. Little did I know we would be getting the red carpet-stained with blood tour of the White House. It involves a buff pres., his cool and pretty First Lady, and their precocious son. The domestic happy family scene starts at Camp David and ends in chaos at the White House. The domestic national tranquility is disturbed by rogue Korean types. The secret service naturally intervenes; they do not like people messing with our domestic national tranquility, much less re-arranging the furniture. More than a few people get their hair mussed in this fun, action packed thriller.

Olympus Has Fallen doesn't come bearing the same sort of blatant, narcissistic patriotism a film like Red Dawn or its 2012 remake, yet it doesn't equip itself with much more brain either. I suppose if you've been victim to lukewarm action movie efforts this year like Bullet to the Head, The Last Stand, and Parker, you may enjoy and embrace this one for its true seriousness and its captivating premise. If you're hoping for something a bit more ideal and one that caters to a movie-going mass much larger than its own demographic, you will be sorely disappointed.I bet I could get by with simply saying that in this film, the White House falls victim to an unexpected attack from a Korean terrorist group and it's up to a Secret Service agent and a whole gang of suits to save the president and the country. After all, isn't that what you, the potential audience member wants? Just a broad overview of the storyline, and an answer to the question, 'how much action is there?' Who cares about characters, suspense, and detail, when we have enough explosions to house an entire franchise? To go a little bit deeper, just to waste a bit more time, Aaron Eckhart is President Benjamin Asher, who is in office when the White House gets violently attacked, Gerard Butler is Mike Banning, a former Army Ranger now serving as a Secret Service agent, and Morgan Freeman is Allan Trumbull, the Speaker of the House who becomes the acting president when Asher is taken as a hostage in the bunker of the house by the terrorist group. Upon seizing entire control of the White House, the terrorist group spends the remainder of the film in negotiation with the acting members of the U.S. government, all lead by Trumbull, as they try to beat the top-secret codes for the nuclear reactors in the U.S. They desperately want the codes to trigger the bombs to explode in their silos, effectively wiping out most, or all, of the population due to radiation poisoning.My main problem with the film is not only is the entire premise redundant and mostly uninteresting, it's that none of the characters are likable or even able to spawn some type of reaction. We already are told how gutless of a President Asher is, so he's a little hard to feel for in the mix of all this, Banning often spends his time scurrying through the White House, shooting all the invaders, dodging all gunfire while his co-workers aren't so lucky, definitely making him a faceless character. The saving grace, one would hope, would be Freeman's Allan, only his character is just as dull and as muted as the other two, rendering his entire performance as a cute novelty.The action scenes are likely to drum a positive reaction from the audience, if that's what they came for (and I'm willing to bet most of them did indeed), but the been-there-done-that format in which they are conducted in really wears on the viewer who wants the luxury of seeing something more. For a film that appears to be the ultimate American terrorist film, I got more jollies off the invasion sequence in the new Red Dawn and I still see that as a less accomplished film than this. The invasion scene here performs exactly how you'd expect; quickly and in a way that lacks sufficient suspense or mystery. We know a lot of people will die and we pretty much know exactly who will live.Olympus Has Fallen benefits from a few moderately suspenseful instances, regardless of how perfunctory they may seem (take the subplot involving President Asher's kid), and does boast a solid set of special effects to go along with it. However, these things sort of get lost in the sea of mediocrity and formula this film wallows in for much of its overlong runtime. On a sidenote, this is where I show my roots different from others my age. Some will tell me, upon giving a film they find superior and worthy of recognition a bad review, that I clearly overanalyze things and need to view things from an entertainment perspective. I always do. I always write reviews based on my personal thoughts, and what I find entertaining and not. For those who ask me if Olympus Has Fallen is worth seeing, or for that matter, entertaining, I will politely tell them "not really," explain why, then steer them towards something more substantial like Spring Breakers. In this way, both parties are benefited equally.My video review of Olympus Has Fallen, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z-7nv2uvv8Starring: Aaron Eckhart, Gerard Butler, and Morgan Freeman.

Action packed, escapist fare with a good performances all around. If you can suspend disbelief about the attack, it's a thrilling tale of dedication to one's job and the redemption of a hero after having fallen from grace.Though the critics have given it mixed reviews, the audiences are liking it and for once I think some of the critiques are overly harsh. Gerard Butler has shown he can "kick ass" with the best of them and if you don't try to compare it with the "original" Die Hard (which none of the Die Hard sequels have ever lived up to), you will enjoy it.Director Antoine Fuqua and Actor/Producer Gerard Butler (with tongues planted firmly in cheeks) have done a good job of giving the audiences an E Ticket ride...so be sure to watch the movie with a big bag of popcorn and enjoy the experience.

Olympus Has Fallen:  A movie review by a big, bald, film loving Jew. I was highly anticipating this modern take on the throw-back, thrill ride, lone-hero-saves- the-day, action flicks of the 80's & 90's. The simplest way to describe it is "Die Hard at the White House", but it is much more than that.In a post 9-11 world, the idea of terrorists attacking the USA, government and its leaders is all the more plausible and therefor more realistic as a film-goer. It adds a sense of "this could happen" while enjoying the story and action before you. The film is very well directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter) and the man knows how to pace story, drama and action extremely well.The plot revolves around Secret Service Agent Mike Banning. After being removed from the President's detail following the accidental death of the First Lady, Banning is now the last hope when Terrorists attack the White House and hold key political figures hostage as well as Banning's old pal the President. Banning is portrayed by the incorrigible and lovable (especially by my wife) Gerard Butler. This is one of my favourite performances by Butler, think more Law Abiding Citizen than PS I Love You. Butler delivers on all fronts; cracking wise (a la John McClane) with the terrorist leader and he's more than capable of taking each "baddie" out one by one. I especially enjoyed his big brother-esque relationship with the President's son.Other notable performances would include the always amazing Morgan Freeman playing Speaker of the House Trumbull, whose thrust into the roll of acting President and has to make the tough decisions as the leader of the free world is being held captive.  Aaron Eckhart (Dark Knight) as President Asher, had heart and compassion both for his fellow captives and his country and it came across very well. Ashley Judd was beautiful and perfect as the First Lady. Although her performance is brief it was captivating nonetheless.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the exciting and moving Score by composer Trevor Morris. It reminded me of the great action, dramatic and patriotic scores of modern classics like The Rock and Armageddon but with his own talented, unique stamp on it. Extremely well done from opening scene to closing credits..Overall, I really enjoyed myself. And that's what it all boils down to. Was I entertained? And the answer is wholeheartedly yes. Olympus Has Fallen is fun fiction, yet has all too believable undertones, and pulse- pounding story with characters and action that deliver. I highly recommend it. 8 out of 10Yippie Ka-Yay Mr. President

Olympus Has Fallen marks Antoine Fuqua's return to the action genre and man, does it deliver. The film plays out like a 90s action film, garnering a hard R rating with hard R violence, which pans out to it's benefit. The film's lead, Gerard Butler, plays his role effortlessly. While donning some cheesy one liners that only Bruce Willis would conjure up, Butler relishes in his role as one bad-ass force to be reckoned with. However, the film's most welcomed performance lies within Aaron Eckhart. His charisma resembles his performance in The Dark Knight but there is a certain controlled rage that boils deep beyond what the roles calls for ad Eckhart does this particularly well within his facial expressions. As far as the other performances go, most are after thoughts from previous characters that we've seen out of most of the cast which includes Morgon Freeman and Melissa Leo, both Oscar winners. However, with these rather tamed performances, that is not where the film suffers.Unfortunately with all the good, there is some bad. The film does resemble that of a 90s action film and it does it with enough grace to allow it to be pardoned from the typical action clichés...for the most part. The film does dwell into the B movie genre just a bit especially with certain scenes that will, most likely, garner some eye rolls from certain audience members. One, in particular, exists in the subplot with finding the president's's son within the overtaken White House. For lack of spoilers, all I will say on the matter is that if it was taken to another level or left out of the first act, then it most likely would have made for a more balanced film.Overall, Olympus Has Fallen makes for one hell of a ride. The violence is brutal, the one liners are cheesy, but it's all in good fun. Fuqua delivers an intense action thrill ride that is most certainly worth the $12 of admission and worth leaving your brain at home to enjoy this utterly ridiculous and graceful addition to the action genre.

Yes.. you will simply say that this is the new Die Hard.. but no, this Mike Banning is better than John Mclane. The Director successfully bring a 2-hours suspense action movie,the plot is good, the acts is good, the strong character of Gerard Butler really makes the difference here. The R rated is much for the violence scene, although this is not to violence if you compare it to The Raid: Redemption, but still this is not really great scene for kids.the only critic for this movie is graphical effect.. for me is quite disappointing for a top-class movie like this. you will see when a plane crashing down in the middle of the town - and exclusively - white house, the cars and traffic are just flowing normally as if nothing happens.. the using of animation is also not very smooth. as conclusion, this movie is still worth to watch, enjoy the action, enjoy the story.

Hold onto to your hat because this movie takes you for a ride. This movie has nonstop action as a team of terrorists storm into and take over the White House in a bid to destroy the United States. The idea of a team of ruthless and determined terrorists infiltrating the security apparatus of a country is nothing new. There have always been traitors who will sell out their country. They exploit the complacency that comes with being a great power, a complacency based on the belief that it can't happen here. And when their guard is down, wham! What makes this movie unique, however, is how it graphically shows how the White House can be stormed and the President and Vice President be taken hostage. Such a scenario is plausible, which adds an element of authenticity to the movie making it that much stronger dramatically. The question is: how to respond. The story revolves around that question as government officials, led by an acting-president who is a legislator and not an executive, are forced to make difficult decisions under extreme pressure that could lead to worldwide instability and disaster. This movie calls attention to the fragile nature of the chain of command and how a security breach can put an entire country at risk. Melissa Leo gives an outstanding performance as the Secretary of Defense, and Gerard Butler is excellent as a discredited secret service agent who is given a chance to redeem himself. This movie is worth watching.

The Rock. Die Hard. Speed. Executive Decision. Under Siege. Olympus brings a lot of classic action flicks to mind, picks and pinches from them, and rolls it all into one big, dumb, explosive shootfest with thrills to spare and a body count so high it would make John Woo baulk. Gerard Butler stars as a hard-nosed Secret Service agent who has since been removed from the presidents' personal bodyguard after the death of the first lady in a car accident 18 months earlier. He is haunted by his failure and regrets the tragedy every day. When tensions between North Korea and South Korea start to simmer, a South Korean envoy arrives at the White House to begin discussions with the US as to how to handle the dangerous North. Unknowingly, the White House has just set in motion events that will lead to the capture of the iconic American building, as NK terrorists have infiltrated the SK envoy, and planned an articulate attack that will capture the president and force him to bend to their will. Only Gerard Butler and his bad American accent can save the day! Olympus Has Fallen is a fun injection of 90s nostalgia. It wants to be an action movie. It wants to be included in the ranks of Under Siege, The Rock, and other iconic action movies of the 80s and 90s. It most desperately aspires to be a new Die Hard, and while it is significantly better than the newest instalment in that franchise, Olympus can't quite achieve the level of suspense and quality of thrills that the original Die Hard provides, but is certainly a sound standalone action film achievement. Olympus has glaring plot holes that it skims over and a suspension of disbelief is essential if you are to enjoy it for what it is. Just deactivate your brain, don't think very hard, because if you do you will miss out on the experience. The film, wanting to continue in the vein of its inspired material, tries not to overindulge in CGI, but ultimately succumbs to temptation considering the massive scale of set pieces and the sheer work involved in practical special effects. Olympus still offers enough squibs and human stuntmen to bring back more of those good memories of Steven Seagal and Nic Cage blasting baddies and jumping from rooftops. It has flaws, its no Shakespeare, it has bad accents, it has glaringly obtuse Die Hard references, it has Morgan Freeman, but most of all, Olympus has hard-boiled action that will keep you glued to the screen from start to finish and makes your $15 ticket feel valuable. Give it a try.

Review by DJ:Really? Really?? You got to be kidding me...I'm...sorry, I should be professional here. However, I'm literally slack-jawed after watching Olympus Has Fallen. Dumbstruck. Flabbergasted. At a loss. Flummoxed. Perplexed. Confused. Baffled. My shoulder and neck hurt after having tilted my head to the side at the countless IMPLAUSIBLE and ridiculous moments in this film. And I expected it! I...I just can't. Okay, let me gather myself. Olympus Has Fallen is the Antoine Fuqua directed....WAIT...Fuqua directed this!? The man behind one of my favorite films Training Day directed this mockery?!? Tyler Perry makes a film a month and Fuqua gets stuck with crap stains like this? Sorry, sorry. Olympus Has Fallen is the...(gulp)...Antoine Fuqua directed film about a Korean attack on American soil. Sound familiar? Well it should. Because you just got through NOT seeing the same concept in the abysmal Red Dawn remake. Oh..oh this time it's the White House, not rural America. That'll make it better. NO! No. It doesn't.How does the White House....THE MOST secured building IN THE WORLD get taken over you ask?(SPOILER ALERT)An airplane with more countermeasures than a Transformer and the most organized attacking force I've ever seen in my entire life. Seriously. The Red Skull and Loki both wielding the cosmic cube couldn't organize an attack this precise and infallible. Patton himself running SkyNet robots couldn't pull off an attack this perfect. At one point I thought the entire population of downtown DC was just armed North Korean terrorists. They come out of nowhere and just happened to ALL get mere feet away from, again...THE MOST SECURED BUILDING IN THE WORLD. The supposed secret service decide the best way to stop a bunch of terrorist firing at them with a .50 cal is to just walk directly into the gunfire, bullets be damned. If it was revealed later that this film was produced by the government in order to get the North Koreans to attempt something this stupid and IMPLAUSIBLE in order to legitimize us kicking their asses then nuking them, I'd buy it.(END OF SPOILERS)Look, I try my best not to spoil movies here on the site. However, I find it to be irresponsible of me as a human being not to prepare you for whats in store if you do plan on seeing this film. And for those saying that this is like Die Hard in the White House...Like DIE HARD in any shape, form, or F*%KING capacity...shame on you. Shame...on...you. You need to slap yourself in the face three times, genuflect to the awesomeness that is John McClane, put in Die Hard, then write a ten page apology letter to Bruce Willis and John McTiernan (In prison) for ever uttering Die Hard in the same paragraph as Olympus Has Fallen.The acting in this is over the top. It is clichéd and wooden. It is paint by numbers. How can a film this stereotypically bad garner talent like Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, and...well Gerard Butler does anything nowadays. When Sly and his Expendables do films like these, we eat it up because they are being ironic and nostalgically nodding to their earlier classics. There are no expectations of weight to the performances. But when you start sprinkling in Academy Award nominees in a film like this, it feels like you just caught them slumming it with some alleyway street walker on the LA strip at three in the morning. They are all better than this. Even you Butler.Olympus Has Fallen is a big budget film that still has a direct to DVD feel. All the stars and horribly CGI-ed fireworks they throw at it still can't polish this turd of a film. If you watch it...brace yourself...then try to tell me I'm wrong.(Sigh) Well, at least this will probably be the last film using this stupid White House under siege plot for a while. (SUDDENLY HANDED A PIECE OF PAPER) I've just been informed that a film in June starring Jaime Foxx and Channing Tatum will be about the White House under siege. And it will be directed by Roland Emmerich.I'm moving to Canada.For more reviews, visit simplisticreviews.blogspot.com

Cliché, cheesy, inane, boring, predictable ... all could be used to sum up this horrible movie. It sucked, and I want my money back. Because this is America, and when things suck you should be able to get your $8 back.I mean, I'm all about suspending disbelief in watching a movie. But Let's face it, if the only three people in the world with the detonation codes for every single nuclear missile were all being held hostage by a terrorist in the White House bunker -- which just happened to be the only place in the world where the detonation codes could be changed -- well, I feel pretty confident the order would be given to storm the White House and kill everyone in it ... including the President. And if the cops and the Navy SEALS couldn't handle this task, I feel pretty sure every one of us gun toting rednecks would swarm on the White House and demolish it to the ground in about 15 minutes.And speaking of stupid, how about that super dooper gun turret they somehow miraculously smuggled into the White House and strategically placed on the roof such that it could shoot down 6 Navy SEAL helicopters??? OMFG! STOOOPID! This movie was Die Hard on steroids. Lame lame lame lame lame, and again, lame. Of course they cap the whole thing off with the proverbial ticking time bomb at the end ... that our hero just manages to deactivate at the last second, saving us all from certain doom.What has the American population become that they would try to pass off an utterly inane and stupid piece of malarkey like this movie on us as an even marginally plausible scenario for a terrorist attack ... never-mind having only one goober inside able to thwart the attack ... and we as Americans don't stand up en masse and demand our freakin' money back for this garbage?? Cheesy!

'OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) It's been a long time since we've had a good 'DIE HARD' rip-off! We used to get them all the time; 'DIE HARD on a bus' ('SPEED'), 'DIE HARD on a plane' ('PASSENGER 57'), 'DIE HARD on a boat' ('UNDER SIEGE'), 'DIE HARD on a train ('UNDER SIEGE 2'), 'DIE HARD at a hockey rink' ('SUDDEN DEATH') and many more. 'DIE HARD at the White House' was inevitable and it's the most preposterous and ridiculous 'DIE HARD' redo yet. It is entertaining though. Surprisingly it's the first of two movies dealing with the same subject matter this year. The Roland Emmerich helmed 'WHITE HOUSE DOWN' comes out in June in which Channing Tatum plays a cop touring the White House who must protect the president (Jamie Foxx) from terrorists there. I hope that's even better but this one definitely doesn't disappoint.This White House invasion film revolves around a Presidential guard named Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) who's let go from his White House position after he fails to save the president's wife (Ashley Judd) in an automobile accident. President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) doesn't want to be reminded of the tragedy so he has Banning removed from his security unit. When North Korean terrorists take over the White House, and take the president hostage, Banning makes his way into the building without being noticed. He then takes on the terrorists one at a time as he communicates with the acting president, Speaker Trumbull (Freeman), and the Secret Service Director (Angela Bassett) outside. Dylan McDermott, Rick Yune, Melissa Leo, Radha Mitchell and Cole Houser also co-star in the film.The movie was directed by Antoine Fuqua (of 'TRAINING DAY' fame) and written by first time film writers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt. As unbelievable as it is it's still somewhat suspenseful and the action is decent. Butler makes a good action hero and it's amazing how much he resembles Mel Gibson in his day. Fuqua definitely knows how to direct an action film like this, the impressive cast is a little underused but they do add some credibility to the laughable premise. Not nearly as cool or entertaining as a 'DIE HARD' film but it is a decent redo. If you're a fan of 'DIE HARD' rip-offs than you're almost sure to enjoy.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75ldnaJSPKw

First of all this rant is going to be filled with SPOILERS so now you are warned. Where do I begin? Do I start with how the antagonists all have magic bullets and the secret service agents don't or that the good guys are too stupid to seek cover when being fired upon. Maybe I should start with the plane that decimates DC and how it wasn't even questioned on the radio till it was flying over DC. Or maybe how Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is giving information to Speaker Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) and says that were forty terrorists and now they are down to twenty-eight. Seriously, I think Banning killed over six so out of all the other agents they killed the other half.My biggest angst is that Kang (Rick Yune) is torturing people for some codes and the President (Aaron Eckhart) keeps saying "Give him the code he will never get mine." and when it finally comes to the point in the movie where Kang needs his code it is ALREADY in the computer. What happened? How did Kang get his code? Also, the fact that they gave into the terrorist demands over the life of the President is hysterical especially when they bring up the phrase "We do not negotiate with terrorists.".Overall, I thought this movie should have been renamed a comedy because I have never laughed so hard at all the ridiculous inaccuracies and weak story line.

Change Mike Banner's name to John McClain, and cast Bruce Willis in the role... and this could easily be Die Hard 6.The only changes that would make that incarnation more appropriate is the movie setup: 1) Remove the opening "flashback" scene2) Replace the above with one that shows John McClain on vacation in Washington DC on the fateful day.3) Voila, Die Hard 6.It's an OK movie, but as a former Die Hard fan, I found it entirely too predictable.

One word: AMAZING. Okay, three more: Beautiful, Heart-stirring, Heart-stopping. It's beautiful because all the white house staff and employees went to great lengths to protect the president and white house. They protected America to the fullest of their abilities due to the horrific circumstances they were under. It is heart-stirring because it really makes you think about what you would do if you were in a situation like that. America was at risk of being blown up completely. It really moved me because I know I wouldn't have been as strong or brave as Gerard Butler, as the main character, Banning. It is heart-stopping because there are moments that are thrilling, meaning you do not know what will happen until it actually happens. It may have massive amounts of killing and I know, thou shalt not kill. But it's so well written, directed and acted. 2 hours of riveting action and mesmerizing entertainment. Never a dull moment. It shows exactly what greed and power will get you, which is NOTHING. It will take you straight to hell though. 10 out of 10. I recommend.

Gerard, where did it all go wrong! I remember Butler as a good actor on his way to being great. He has the personality and the talent to do so much more with his craft. This was formulaic with an absurd plot - which constantly contradicted itself. The entire US foreign policy changed to save the President. No, don't think that would happen - you just get another President. A major sequence where they torture staff to get missile codes with the President vowing never to give his up - which he doesn't, but they somehow tap it into the computer anyway. Eh??? The fight scenes are beyond dumb, the assault on the white House - might appeal to a ten year old. The C140 attack, was so cringe worthy as to make me actually rise out the chair. The General in the control room!!! Stop it. And the flag waving cringeworthy speech at the end - do any Americans still buy into that type of faux patriotism. I so hope not.You take one look at the cast, and think this must be OK. In fact, you look at the cast and think this might be great.It's not.

When I saw the first trailers for Olympus Has Fallen...I was thrilled. I thought it looked exactly like the kind of good old fashion R-Rated Action flick that used to get made or the ones that have simply faltered lately. I felt like if this was the kind of action flick that I love that it too would fail at the box office. I was relieved and excited to see that the film opened very well and furthermore was even getting some great reviews. So when I saw the film for myself I was thrilled that the movie was EXACTLY what I anticipated. Its a throwback to Die Hard, AirForce One, and just great gritty, violent, R-Rated action flicks of 80's and 90's. The film actually reeks of Die Hard (and I don't mean that to be a negative thing at all.) Olympus Has Fallen felt more Die Hard than A Good Day To Die Hard did...minus Bruce Willis. The action is visceral and dark. You will feel nauseous and emotional watching that initial invasion scene as they mercilessly murder innocent people on the streets. There is just something powerful and gritty about it. Some of the hand to hand combat scenes were a little dark which was unfortunate but for the most part the fight scenes were brilliantly done.Gerard Butler has had a distinctive up and down career. 2012 was a bit of a slump for him but he also tends to try his hand in so many different genres. Whether he likes it or not, action might just be his niche. He does a truly outstanding job taking the lead as Secret Service agent Mike Banning. The character could be described as your stereotypical action hero in this type of film and that would be true. However, Butler pulls it off in true form. Aaron Eckhart is perfectly Presidential as the President. Not only does he look like a hero and have great charisma but he truly looks like a towering beacon of American politics. I wanted to see him jump into the action a little more but it wasn't about him doing that. He was excellent and him and Butler have great chemistry. Dylan McDermott was just terrific in his role. It was a smaller part but so vital and just really well done. He was perfectly cast. Morgan Freeman does what Morgan Freeman does best. If you like him then you love his characters. Once again he ends up playing the acting President of The United States and he always ups the class of any cast. Melissa Leo is also very good in a small role as Secretary of Defense. Unfortunately for her she got one of the cheesier moments in the film but she handles it well and plays a character with a lot of spirit and courage. And to the character that I think literally makes or breaks an action like this...the villain, the big bad, the leader...in this case he is played by Rick Yune. I was sceptical to see the main villain being played by an unknown but I eat my scepticism because he was excellent. He commanded the screen and was appropriately evil at every turn. I don't think he and Butler had perfect chemistry as foes but it was good enough. Supporting cast deserve mention too including stand out performances from Finley Jacobsen, Angela Bassett, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser.Perhaps the beauty and also the drawback to the movie is that it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. Some will cry foul and say that its predictable and rehashed material and in some aspects they would be right. But when you're making a genre specific film and trying to appeal to those fans then you need to use the familiar ingredients. I didn't know who directed the film while watching it but I kept imagining scenarios of what this would have been like in the hands of McG or Michael Bay or Tony Scott...any number of directors could have done something different with it. Antoine Fuqua comes from Music Videos which usually spells bad news but he has made a name for himself in directing. I have seen a few of his films and enjoyed them. I believe he is an action film fan at heart and he happens to know what the audience wants to see. Olympus Has Fallen wasn't quite brilliant. With any action flick that follows the path there are certain issues with that as well. Inevitable plot holes that simply have to be overlooked (Why did no one even attempt to save the First Lady or check on her well being? Why did the Secret Service rush out the front doors of The White House for five minutes while a Helicopter mowed them down, after the first wave they probably would have stopped rushing?) And so on and so forth. But as a HUGE old school action fan myself I know how to conveniently ignore reality and just enjoy it. One man, with a special set of skills, left alone to defend the world/White House...it was everything I wanted it to be. Go in with the proper expectations and you'll have a solid two hours (it flies by!) of old fashion, popcorn eatin', red blooded entertainment. And once again (I've said this before in my reviews) I'm Canadian and Canadians who see movies like this always make fun of and bully the patriotism in the film. (Oh 'Muricans got their propaganda eh?) Well I would like to say again that I wish our country and other countries had even a tenth of the patriotism and traditions that most of America has. Enough said...now go watch Gerard Butler kick some serious butt.

I am not saying that Die Hard is outdated... in fact, i think opposite. No movie fan, no matter what age, should go without seeing it. However, this is the closest thing we are going to get to another movie like the original Die Hard. Both movies share many similar characteristics, only the stakes are much larger in Olympus Has Fallen.In Die Hard, the only thing was a lot of money was going to be taken. This time, not only is the President's life at stake, but it evolves into a much more high-risk situation.Olympus Has Fallen shows great acting in it's talent. Veteran Morgan Freeman brings a performance as strong as the rest of his. Along with that, Aaron Eckhart brings his "A" game, much like The Dark Knight. Last, but certainly not least, Gerard Butler delivers the best performance of his career.Olympus Has Fallen delivers the sense of awe that i have not experienced in a while. The entire White House attack scene will leave you with an open jaw, watered eyes, and a sense of despair. The attack scene ranks among the most unforgettable action scenes of the last decade.Is Olympus Has Fallen perfect? Absolutely not, there are flaws and some things that make no sense whatsoever, but it is definitely one of the most entertaining films (so far) of the year.

A very enjoyable 2 hours spent. Great performances, edge of your seat suspense. It takes hold of you from minute one to the end. Gerard Butler at his best, Morgan Freeman always great and so were the rest of the cast. What I would like to point out though is: how believable can this be?? So many people found it such a terrible movie, because... how can this possibly happen to us in the USA?? Come on people, the worst ever acts of terror have happened in the US of A!! I am not saying that the exact replication of this scenario can happen but.. so much else HAS happened, Why do you act so surprised and offended? It can happen is the US or anywhere else in the world as long as there terrorists around no matter where they come from. As far as the movie is concerned, it is a good story well brought to the screen by Antoine Fuqua and of course it's main star Gerard Butler.I am sick and tired of reading about "anhother Die Hard" movie. From critics to audiences,if one will say it, then everybody else repeats the same theme. Come on people, find something more original to say otherwise, don't say anything, be creative instead of boring.The movie was anything but boring. And after all, THIS IS A MOVIE. Go see it and enjoy it. It is the best action movie I have seen in a long time. I highly recommend it.

Spoiler Alert - ummm....there is no real plot outside of copying every other action movie where the President or some loved one is captured by a supper bad a** and the hero royally kicks their bad a** all while getting his own a** kicked all over the place by other super bad a**es that are just really not that bad but just dumb....oh and don't forget the ultimate earth shattering have to save the country (or planet, or plane, or building, etc....) from the super disaster planned that no one knows about.....and wait for it.....a count down that they barely make.Mix in some Die Hard (Bruce Willis), add a splash of Air Force One (Harrison Ford), stir in a touch of the Matrix, and chill will a poor plot.....you have Olympus Has Fallen.Overall I was pleased, although I enter theaters for these kind of movies with reservation. Cast was good. Plot was lacking as expected. Predictable for the most part. Of course they were politically correct and would not blame what happened on any specific nation, but on a 'terrorist' from a specific nation. Would have liked Morgan Freeman (playing Speaker of the House and acting President) to have had more balls and told the terrorists to stick it up their a***s and just invaded North Korea immediately upon the demand to withdraw from the DMZ.The plot was so close to the original Die Hard in some ways, that there were scenes I swear they completely ripped offs from it. The cigarette scene, the helicopters and the roof scene, the hunting down the one rogue unknown good guy hiding element of the plot. Very very much a Die Hard wanna be.There were some relatively direct links to Air Force One as well. The President not following protocol leading to the mess they were in, the super duper secrete bunker to protect the president that our worst enemies not only know of, but know how all its computer systems et al in said bunker work. The family threat element (although that was not dominate like in AF1).Matrix - yea, the whole hiding in the walls thing was a direct rip from the Matrix.....no getting around that.....My recommendation....go see it and enjoy watching a very bad situation where the good guy kicks the s**t out of some bad a***s but don't expect anything original.

WARNING: OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN IS MEANT FOR BAD ASSES. THEREFORE, THIS REVIEW (OBVIOUSLY) CONTAINS LANGUAGE.In the history of cinema, there have been plenty of films that demand that we stretch the realism of our real world. From sic-fi films such as Independence Day to Die Hard films that have one man taking out an incredible threat on his own, films love to stretch reality as far as they can. The new film Olympus Has Fallen may have stretched it the farthest I have seen in a very, very long time.Starring Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassett, and Morgan Freeman, Olympus Has Fallen tells the story of a secret service agent (who had previously been on duty to protract the President, but was transferred after an accident in which the First Lady was killed) who must take out an entire North Korean terrorist cell that has successfully invaded the White House. That's right. The White House was successfully breached and the President has been taken hostage.But hold on to your dicks, because s*** talking agent Mike Banning (Butler) is here to save the god damn day. With nothing but instincts, a mean set of fighting skills, and a determination we only see from the real heroes like Rambo and John McClane, Banning is on a two-part mission: save the President and kill the son of a b**** that attacked the country he loves. Get out your sleeveless American flag t-shirts for this one, folks. Because f*** sleeves. Immense patriotism will be more than enough to keep you warm in any theater showing Olympus Has Fallen.So how did these a-holes take over the White House? I mean, this is the most secure building in the world. How could these guys get in? Well, simple. First they flew a giant air bomber right through restricted airspace, shooting down a few fighter jets trying to tell them to back off, and took out the military personnel on the roof of the White House. Simple. Then they bombed the gate surrounding the White House and drove in giant dump trucks heavily equipped with machine guns. All they needed was for every secret service member to come running unprotected out the front doors of the White House, which, obviously, they do. Then they had their leader ready on the inside, teamed up with a traitor secret service agent, so they can kidnap the President. Duh. Piece of cake. And all they had to do was have everything go quickly and perfectly without military interference. I'm honestly surprised this hasn't already happened in real life. It looks so simple.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/olympus-has-fallen/

While there's a lot of folks saying that this is another "Die Hard", I think that it's more of a remake of "Under Siege" starring Steven Seagal from 1992. But this time, it's Gerard Butler playing Secret Service agent Mike Banning doing the action (and doing a pretty good job of it) instead of Steven Seagal playing Chief Petty Officer Casey Ryback. At times, it's almost the same word for word, but there are more plot twists in Olympus Has Fallen than in Under Siege. There were a couple of places where the script didn't make sense with what the bad guys wanted though, and because of the similarity of the two movies, it was somewhat predictable although Under Siege was on water and Olympus Has Fallen is on land. Regardless, it's a good ride if ya like action films, especially if ya like Gerard Butler.

"Let's play a game of F--- Off. You go first." Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) to bad guy Kang (Rick Yune).If that sounds like a line John McClane (Bruce Willis) would have tossed off, then you get the idea why Olympus Has Fallen is being called "Die Hard in the White House." The hero here is Mike Banning, a disgraced Secret Service agent once assigned to POTUS, who gets his chance to refurbish his reputation by trying to wrench the White House from North Korean commandos who have taken it over.Olympus is a B actioner that follows the formula for presidents as hostages (see Air Force One starring Harrison Ford), at first neutered but ultimately victorious through wit and brawn. With the president's son involved in the action, including several high-ranking government officials as hostage, the president is no position to fight back as Ford's character was.The boilerplate action is supplied by Banning, played with cool and some occasional light banter by Butler. The sense of humor in part comes from an awareness of the thriller genre's formula and a willingness to lightly satirize it. Although some of the action is hard to believe, at times there's a gritty realism like swift shots to the head and headlocks that do their job quickly and efficiently. When garbage men and tourists turn into ugly Asian terrorists, certain believability about disguise and surprise that make me think it's all possible. Director Antoine Fuqua scheduled the attack to reflect in real time the fifteen minutes it would take the military to arrive at the White House.The black SUV's, the sun glasses, the drum rolls, the foreign assassins, the wife at home—these stock elements and more suggest we've been there before. Yet considering this is the dead zone time of year for the movies, you might enjoy some old-fashioned thrills.

I like a good action film as well as the next guy/gal and have been looking forward to this one to help get the awful taste of the last Die Hard movie out of my mouth. Being a little over critical of wardrobe and set dressing, I had to just shrug off the low quality dress shirts they put on Aaron and his secret servicemen in the first scene. Okay, I can do that. The suits themselves looked pretty good so you didn't notice the shirts so much once they put their jackets on. You don't get to relax for long before one bad decision after another lands the president, some of his staff and the bad guys in the president's bunker under the White House. I have to admit that the story they created to get to this point was disappointing. When you ignore protocol, you will have problems. That's the main theme here. The rest is high speed action, more bad decisions and only Mike (Gerard Butler, looking real good) can clean up the mess. Took me forever to figure out who Gerard's wife was. Radha Mitchel, aka Johnny Depp's wife in Finding Neverland.There was no fall from grace for Gerard's character so don't let that mislead you. More like, you remind me of my loss and grief so I don't want to see you right now. That's not a fall from grace.There was a scene at the beginning that made me think there was going to be some political whining that reflects too much on the present whine fest in our country and I was glad that didn't last long.Great cast. Even the kid is good. Not on long but not annoying like so many kids are written.There is lots of bloody violence but what would you expect from a radical group taking over the White House? Silly String?

Greetings again from the darkness. Gerard Butler doesn't always make wise decisions when picking his projects. In the right role, men admire him for being cool and tough, while women are enchanted with his charm. The role of Secret Service Agent Mike Banning is just about perfect for Butler. He not only gets to be an action hero, but he also has a strong relationship (with Radha Mitchell) and is a role model for the President's young son. Butler is so nearly perfect here, he should be cast in the next Old Spice commercial.The movie starts out with the backstory on how Agent Mike Banning (Butler) fell out of grace with the President and was reassigned to a desk job at Treasury. Pushing paper is like Siberia for a man of Banning's make-up. A terrorist invasion on the White House tosses Banning right smack in the middle of a violent and explosive act designed to leave the entire United States decimated. Circumstances being what they are, Banning is the only hope.Movies like this must have a quality bad guy. We get icy Rick Yune as Yang, a North Korean criminal mastermind. You might think this is extremely timely given the real world in North Korea, but Yune is certainly no Governmental official. The attack is very well planned and leaves Yune locked in the White House security bunker with the President, Vice President and Secretary of Defense (a spunky Melissa Leo). At the Pentagon, this leaves the Secretary of State (Morgan Freeman) and a bombastic General (Robert Forster) jockeying for control. Angela Bassett is there to referee. While this group of officials sits around looking anxious and worried, Agent Banning is a one man wrecking crew against the terrorists.The images of the White House being attacked will prove quite disturbing to any US citizen and the sequence comes off as something that could possibly occur. Let's hope director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) performed sufficient research to know this attack couldn't actually happen. Still, Aaron Eckhart is a believable President ... in the Harrison Ford mode, tough as nails but also intelligent.There are of course similarities to Clint Eastwood's 1993 film In The Line of Fire, and many are comparing it to the 1988 classic Die Hard. For me, the difference in Gerard Butler's Mike Banning and Bruce Willis' John McClane is that Butler is the right guy in a bad place, while McClane was a good guy in the wrong place. The action sequences in Olympus are even bigger than Die Hard, and it's certainly clear there is much more at stake.The cast also includes Dylan McDermott and Ashley Judd. Without giving anything away, I'll admit this is my favorite Ashley Judd role of all time. It will be interesting to see how this one compares to Roland Emmerich's White House Down, which comes out in June. The story lines are almost identical with WHD starring Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx. Olympus Has Fallen is a very satisfactory action movie and Butler has re-established himself as a real movie star. It's doubtful Emmerich's version will stand up against this one.

OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (2013) **1/2 Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Rick Yune, Dylon McDermott, Angela Bassett, Melissa Leo, Robert Forster, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Finley Jacobson, Ashley Judd. "Die Hard in The White House" best sums up this by-the-numbers yet entertaining to a fault popcorn actioner with Butler as a disgraced Secret Service agent attempting a shot at redemption when Washington DC is plagued with a horde of Korean terrorists hellbent on nuclear destruction and basically the usual ploy of making life on Earth hell. A high body count doesn't make up for a pedestrian script by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt but director Antoine Fuqua keeps the pace fast but not so furious.

Like Milius' Red Dawn (though not quite as accomplished technically), it's both completely indefensible substantively and yet a very enjoyable action film all the same. It knows what it is - jingoistic, idiotic drivel - but it's well shot and competently acted idiotic drivel if that makes sense. Fuqua, in the mold of Milius, really has his heart-thumping loud and proud as an All-American, but he injects real red-meat and vigor into his direction of the action, which has its chaos but is never hard to follow or disorientating (or it's more controlled chaos to put it another way). Gerard Butler is... as good as he can be, which means he's alright, as an action hero for the first time in a while, and more believable than a Leonidas or whatever. Aaron Eckhardt was just one second away from accidentally yelling "RACHEL!" ala Dark Knight. And Morgan Freeman looked mostly tired, but could still command the screen better than half the rest of the people in the room save for Robert Forster. Oh, and did I mention this movie has a lot of logical gaps (Dylan McDermott's character, for example), and the CGI, such as when a certain rectangular monument is destroyed for no real reason except for cinematic eye-candy, looks so awful that your Windows 95 screen-saver was more convincing? There is that. Olympus Has Fallen has an innumerable body count, effectively nasty-cum- stock villains, dialog that is to-the-point and story driven (even if that story, again, can be pretty stupid, and when it comes to those nuclear launch codes really needs a Dr. Strangelove in a wheelchair to come in and explain it to the Pentagon people), and I had a fun time watching the violence ensue. Perhaps when stacked up against actual bulls**** like Taken 2 or a Die Hard 5, its cinematic sins are slightly less egregious- it borrows from other films, liberally one might say (a little *original* Die Hard here, Air Force One there, any given hostage- crisis flick there, oh and how about most 24 episodes crammed into the climax), but somehow it trusts its audience to either be dumb enough to enjoy the ride, or that the smart people know its dumb but can enjoy its own dumb logic on its own terms. In other words, it's patently absurd, and all it's missing is a bald eagle to swoop in at the end to congratulate the heroes.

Mike(Gerard Butler) a once great secret service guy, is now working for Treasury, cause he managed to save the president(Aaron Eckhart), during a car accident, but failed to save the first lady(Ashley Judd). Now two years later a Korean terrorist(Rick Yune) and his crew have taken over the white house, taking the president and his crew hostage. Mike makes his into the white house, will Mike become there last hope? Way better than A Good Day To Die Hard, the action and the violence was not glorified like a typical action film like mode, it felt very real, like this is really happening. Gerard Butler was good not really trying to do Bruce Willis. Aaron Eckhart is also good as the president, acting like a president would act if a president was in this situation. The supporting cast does not disappoint either. Rick Yune was a terrifying bad guy.

Anyone that has ever been inside the security "bubble" of the President of the United States (POTUS) know how tight it is to get inside. When I am around POTUS I know I am likely on the safest place on earth. In Olympus Has Fallen, this movie is filled with unexpected twist and turns, the main premise of the movie is when POTUS security has been compromise and a force of evil doers take over the White House, aka Olympus. The pressure falls on secret service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) to save the day. Some very intense shoot them up scenes, filled with modern weapons surely used to combat the new war on terror. This movie is perfect the big screen and I saw as my maiden experience with RPX® (Regal Premium Experience), the seats are comfy and the sound is intense at Regal at Atlantic Station.

First off,I am not a an ardent lover of action cinema.Watching guns blazing,bombs exploding,tanks rolling etc....(Insert Noise) is not very appealing to me.Fortunately Olympus has Fallen does not do them over the top and the action that is there is realistic and well executed, enough to set the mood and tone for an action film.The beginning ten-fifteen minutes are interesting and you think you are in for a treat but the movie doesn't rise too high from there.On the positive side though the acting is decent.Aaron Eckhart is convincing as president of U.S.Gerard Butler as Mike Banning steals the show with a powerful portrayal of a towering hunk who dominates his enemies,shows no mercy and tolerates little bullshit.An intriguing character and Butler does justice to the role.Morgan Freeman is well...Morgan Freeman,this is certainly not his best work.I really liked Ashley Judd and wished the plot allowed more of her.The problem with Olympus has fallen is that it rarely goes above the mediocre.It is OK as an action film.Not thrilling and gripping enough for a hostage drama to be called a thriller.The wisecracks do elicit a smile but you wish there were more.Its just a fine watch....not one of those movies that stays with you once you walk out of the cinema.Good enough for a theater watch?It's your call.

OK so since i got to sleep on it. Olympus Has Fallen was a pretty good solid action flick. A little crazy with the CGI as usual in todays modern action movies. I could not help but wonder whether this was the original script for Die Hard 5. All they would have had to do was have John McClane touring the White House and the s**t hits the fan. So many parallels between this and the original Die Hard. Like the stereotypical terrorists who try to fake their own deaths at the end...just to name one. But seriously, it was like watching a rip of Die Hard without John McClane. But Gerard Butler saved the movie from being a complete rip off and it turned out to be an average action flick (only by modern standards). This movie wouldn't hold a light to the 80s gems such as Predator, Terminator, and Die Hard (or basically anything with Stallone or Arnie)

The present-day President Benjamin Asher(Aaron Eckhart) of the United States gets entangled in a war originating from the deep past between the North & South Korea. Shockingly, a Combat Air-craft made it all the way to Washington headed straight for the White House just when the President was having a meeting with the Prime Minister of South Korea. Machine Guns unveiled, bullets fired, people died like ants & a mini-war arose in attempts to infiltrate & take control of Olympus and threaten to detonate all the Nuclear missiles unless the US retreats its troops that aid South Korea. Now the president is trapped in a bunker deep below and surrounded by rebels who wont budge unless their mission sees its fruition.This is where (Ex-Secret Service Agent) Mike Banning(Gerard Butler) steps in and carefully makes his way into the White House to save the President & extinguish this new-found threat against the United States.With his previously gained knowledge of the White House, Watch as Banning draws a mental map, takes control over the disaster & wins the situation with his epic heroic & well deserved skills yet again confirming that anarchy and terror can be well treated with patience & an iron hard will & determination fueled with awesomeness.True Victory is not borrowed, but earned.Enjoy this kick-ass movie! :)

Thanks to the screenwriters, Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt there is finally a political thriller that an audience can use. It's called "Olympus has Fallen". After that last "Die Hard" movie, the un-China "Red Dawn" and the extensible "Expendables", to see another big action piece.. Well, we were just bracing ourselves for more un-excitement. But what a pleasant turn.This time, screenwriters gave us a believable down-on-luck security officer to identify with; adding fight sequences, that for a change, make you want to get out of your seat and lend somebody a fist; but ultimately, we are given a visceral, choke-able villain to get your hands around that will make anybody re-think our future gun policy.And then there is the matter of the great timing of the release of this film. One of the screenwriters must confess to also being a speech writer for the North Korean Leadership. May the leader, Kim Jong Um, spark a comedy next season.

Olympus Has Fallen (2013) *** (out of 4)Former Presidential guard Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) finds himself going up against a group of terrorists who have overtaken the White House and now have the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) held captive. Banning must go thru the White House to save the President's son as well as try to save the main man before the terrorists get ahold of what they're after. Look, if you're walking into OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN expecting some sort of heartfelt political drama then I'd recommend leaving before the trailers are over. If you're looking for an outrageous, over-the-top, corny, goofy madhouse then this here will be your cup of tea. There's no question about it but director Antoine Fuqua does a terrific job at keeping the action moving at a fast pace and giving us some characters to root for. The film really does seem like a throwback to those films of the 1940s that were made when the U.S. was involved in WWII. Those films were very patriotic, waved the U.S. flag proudly and didn't give a darn about anyone else. This film certainly waves the flag with the villain being North Korea and I must admit that I was a little shocked at how blazing the film was in painting them as pure evil. I was also shocked to see how many guts this film had because at no time did you ever know where the story was going to go because you even have women getting beaten, which is usually something that doesn't happen in these type of films. The action is pretty much non-stop after a somewhat silly opening where we see the "tragic" circumstance that leads Banning away from his job. It doesn't take long for the guns to start firing and we're treated to all sorts of fights, explosions and violent deaths. The film is really over-the-top in terms of its story but it's equally matched by the graphic violence, which just makes for a fun time. There's even a torture sequence, which contains some hilarious dark humor. The cast is another major plus as Butler has no problem playing a sympathetic tough guy and of course Eckhart can handle his part. The supporting cast is just as fun and includes Melissa Leo, Dylan McDermott, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett and Robert Forster. Again, the plot itself is pretty far-fetched and there's no question that the film doesn't try to be anything other than a popcorn movie. I think it really succeeds all around and is certainly one of the better action pictures so far in 2013.

I won't call this the greatest film I've seen, but when you look at the drawl of mediocre sequels and crappy remakes that Hollywood has been cranking out for the past few years, this film is definitely one worth while. I did my best to go into the theater with NO expectations, that way I could go either way in terms of approval or disapproval. Overall I approve. The film had a very nice flow to it, and brought a sort of old- school feel to theater. You'll probably hear people describe this as what Die Hard 5 should've been, or what it would be like if Die Hard went to DC. That does place it fairly well. This film is certainly reminiscent of the legendary Die Hard series, but somehow manages not to do a total rip-off. The cast was well picked, though I do wonder if names like Morgan Freeman were picked just to beef it up. Regardless, overall I'd give the actors a 9/10. Butler did a very good job, and Angela Bassett and Rick Yune were very memorable and convincing in their roles. Eckhart has seen better days in his career, but his performance was enough to be convincing at the very least. The story had a nice flow to it which is something I miss very much in films. There were small twists here and there, but all in all it fit together. The action sequences were well done, though I think Hollywood devotes too much time to FX and not enough to a good movie. The dialog was questionable though, at times. I felt like some of it was just too cliché, or just flat out poorly placed. I think the characters could've been much more had they had better lines. With a better script and perhaps more character development, this movie would've gone incredibly far. But as I said, in comparison to what's been coming out, this movie is a much needed break. All in all, it's worth watching with some friends once or twice. *A note to parents though, that the invasion on the White House could give the opening scene from Private Ryan a run for it's money. It's much more gruesome than the R-rating might hint at. Other than that, this movie is a very enjoyable action flick, hopefully a sign that things are looking up in the movie industry.

Olympus Has Fallen is a mostly formulaic action movie that hit the right spot for me. It's not entirely original but it is entertaining, which is more than I can say for every other action flick that has come out this year. This is the script they should've slapped the Die Hard name to instead of that garbage that was the newest Die Hard. In fact, this is the best Die Hard since the third one. It follows the simple formula; lone hero in a confined space, vastly out-manned and out gunned, ton of kills and the occasional one liner. Olympus has Fallen does all of these things exceedingly better than any action-er I've seen this year.Before I get too ahead of myself, should probably let you know what this flick is about. Olympus Has Fallen is about disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning who finds himself trapped inside the White House in the wake of a terrorist attack; using his inside knowledge, Banning works with national security to attempt to rescue the President from his North Korean kidnappers. The story is not the most original but moves at a good pace and is not too complicated. What makes this movie stand apart from the others is the hugely talented cast. Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Melissa Leo, Ashley Judd, Dylan McDermott, Cole Hauser, Radha Mitchell & Rick Yune. Told ya the cast was huge. Everyone is very capable in their roles but due to the size it seems a few people are underused (Melissa Leo and Angela Bassett especially). I'm a huge fan of Gerard Butler's when he's in action flicks (QUIT DOING ROMANTIC COMEDIES), he's very likable and physical enough to make the action believable. Aaron Eckhart plays the President, and is awesome as usual but it does feel like he slips into Harvey Dent mode a few times. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman, you know what to expect with him.The actions scenes are extremely well done, the CG looks a little video gameish at points but it's OK. A ton of stuff gets blown up, the body count is huge and there are some surprisingly brutal deaths. As far as the action goes, it gets an A+. Antoine Fuqua directed this movie and does a decent job. He creates an incredible sense of tension, which is a rarity for these type of movies. Like I said, the action is well done but it seems like Mr. Fuqua watched a few too many Michael Bay movies. The slow motion is overused, the color schemes are similar, the music is hokey and final scene (which involves an American flag) looks like it was lifted from every Bay film. As you can tell, I'm not a fan of Bay's and these things are about the only negatives I have.Olympus Has Fallen is the best action movie of 2013, so far. It was a ton of fun to watch, had some very good tension and was simply a really fun watch. If you're a fan of action movies, this is a definite watch.

This movie was pretty suspenseful from the beginning. It is basically Die Hard in the White House. Would Bruce Willis have done just as good of a job? Probably, but we'll never know. The action is intense including gun fights, explosions, stabbings, head shots, did I say stabbings? Mike Banning likes to kill bad guys, and he usually chooses to shoot them in the head or stab them. For me at least, it never got old. There of course are predictable parts, and this pieces together like the other movies from this type of hostage/takeover drama, but it seemed to work, take itself seriously at times, but many times, not too seriously. There are cheesy moments with the action and some typical plot holes, but at 2 hrs, I'm sure Fuqua was just trying to simplify it. Many of the scenes with the president felt legit and characteristic of a stand-up guy in his position.Check out www.moviescoundrel.com for more

A solid action flick. Gerald Butler is brutal and lives up to his character's reputation-- and manages to be empathetic and show genuine humanity at the same time. The bad guys are BAD and unrelenting. No morality conflicts here, these guys are out for blood. If you were let down by the latest movie masquerading as a 'Die Hard' film, go see this one. You'll be pleasantly entertained, I think. The film is well paced, and won't bore you with any pointless 'non-action', narrative, and flashback scenes that have plagued a lot of recent films. The other characters are believable, and its nice to see Morgan Freeman make and appearance, although his involvement seems a bit muted-- and he doesn't seem as free to stretch his acting muscles as much as he did in the Batman Trilogy and other films. All in all, worth the ticket price of a manatee showing.

I've always had a soft spot for films where an action hero kills about 50 bad guys, escapes unscathed, and in the grand finale, has hand-to-hand combat with the No 1 bad guy, saves the destruction of the country with 3 second to go, and manages to take swipes at North Korea and the middle east. You do, I admit, get your money's worth of violence, with dead bodies strewn all over the White House (or what's left of it). I guess after Zero Dark Thirty they wanted to give equal time to the bad guys. And on this account, they succeeded admirably. it will change your behavior the next time you visit a green grocer in New York. Kim Jong-un is said to be a movie buff. If he watches this one, make sure Dennis Rodman is by his side.

I am surprised at how many reviewers have given it rating above 7! In my view most of the reviews here, are irrationally biased. Yes, the plot lacks originality and it better make up for it in its treatment. They have really worked hard on action sequences but the edits have failed many scenes. For the whole movie, you don't feel that the protagonist is shattered or to be defeated or even weak. It was really difficult to get in synch with the feelings of the central character.(Its very easy for US audience to relate with 'US is under attack' or 'the world is going to end' kind of plots). Script has got some holes which can quickly kill the flow of watching. The movie is good but not at all great. deserves 5 or 6. Hollywood has much much better to offer than this.

Really did not like this movie. I'm giving it a 5 for the production values. Sure, this is Die Hard in the White House, but boy did it take a wrong turn. After 9/11 would it really take so long to bring down the assault plane? Was it really necessary to make the crumbling of the Washington Monument a copy of the collapse of the towers? Should not the seal attack be called off after seeing what they were up against? As for the hostages, the only politician to earn my respect was Melissa Leo's Secretary McMillan, despite her over the top recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, comes across as serious and dedicated, unlike the President. I know there's not much review as criticism here, but this is one of the few films that I couldn't get over the stupidity of some plot points.

Olympus Has Fallen has a lot to like about it, but there are too many times that I was asking myself "Why would he do that?" or "Why would he think that?" or "How could that happen". There were just a few too many moments that didn't make any sense.The action is intense and nearly non-stop after the opening 15-20 minutes of the film. Although there were many predictable moments, the film also has its share of twists to keep it interesting. I will say that I made one of the villains early on, although I'm not so sure it wasn't a lucky guess rather than a flaw in the film.Gerard Butler is a likable and capable lead in this action film. As others have stated, his Mike Banning character can certainly draw comparisons to Bruce Willis' John McClane character from the Die Hard movies, and deservedly so. Like McClane, Butler's Banning fights as virtually a one-man army against the bad guys and has good one-liners that make him ever the more fun.Aaron Eckhart is also enjoyable as President Asher, a character that tries to be nearly as tough as Banning. Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett give their usual strong supporting roles, as does Melissa Leo in a small, but noticeable role as the Secretary of Defense. Rick Yune was solid as Kang, the main villain. For an action movie, the acting was much better than the norm overall.Where I believe the movie does fall apart is the plot/storyline. The main plot was a little weak, although I could buy into that. After all, this is an action flick, so one generally has to suspend disbelief. But about every 5 or 10 minutes in this film, somebody does something that just didn't make any sense if one has any logic at all. Throughout most of the movie, Banning seems to be not only the great action hero, but the only character that has any sense at all. Brains + brawn with good dialog makes for a great action hero, but couldn't someone else use their brain occasionally.Don't get me wrong, it was a fun movie that will keep you entertained for a couple of hours, just don't expect it to be the perfect movie. On the action, characters, and acting alone, I could have given this an 8 or so, but with the holes in the plot/storyline, it unfortunately drops to the 6.5-7 range, which in many ways is kind of a shame. I gave Olympus the 7.

Watching this film brought back many Die Hard memories, and yes everyone is saying that this is pretty much Die Hard in the White House. I can't argue with that. This film is actually a hell of a lot better then that recent disaster A Good Day to Die Hard. It's like Gerard Butler was getting in touch with his inner John McClane. All said this film is an awesome action flick, despite it's cliché moments, plot holes, and American vomiting patriotism.Gerad Butler plays Mike Banning, a former U.S. Army Ranger turned Secret Service agent in charge of the Presidential Detail. Banning is close to President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), the First Lady (Ashley Judd), and their son Connor. After a tragic car accident that results in the death of the First Lady, Banning is basically demoted to a desk job at the Treasury Department near the White House. One day a group of terrorists launch a coordinated attack on the White House and take the President hostage. During the attack Banning manages to shot his way into the White House. With the White House under terrorist control, the president hostage, and U.S. forces powerless, its up to Mike Banning to take down the Terrorists from the inside, before they succeed in their terrifying plot to destroy the United States.What I enjoyed most about this film was that It was almost like a nostalgic trip to those awesome action flicks on the 90s like Die Hard, Air Force One, and Under Siege. Its has this old school action style to it which brought back many fond memories of the Die Hard themed action flicks. If you love the adrenaline rush of an action film then you'll love this movie. I suppose Olympus has Fallen doesn't really offer anything original, and one might pick out some obvious flaws. Do the terrorists realize that their actions would result in the total destruction of their own country? How the heck did the terrorists get their hands on an AC-130 Spectre gunship? Where did they get that super advanced anti-aircraft defense system? Would the President and his staff really give up such top secret information to save each other when they are risking the lives of millions of people, and the well being of the whole country!? and how did Morgan Freeman become President of the United States Again?Despite that this film is still a lot of fun. The action is intense, bloody, and unrelenting. Gerard Butler has this commanding presence that you'd expect from an action star. He plays Mike Banning as a hard working professional rather then falling into that cliché disgraced hero looking for redemption role. He kicks ass, he cracks clever one liners, hes not invincible he bleeds and hurts, and come across as a more believable hero compared to some of the other crap action stars we've seen here and there. We get a great performance from a great supporting cast led by Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, and Melissa Leo. The main villain played by Rick Yune is ruthless and smart, which makes him a more terrifying character. I could see Rick Yune in the same mold as many of thos epic Die Hard Villains. Every great hero needs a great villain. To its credit you do end up rooting for Gerard Butler, you are kept interested, and you are kept thinking what will happen next. This film is what the recent Die Hard movie should have been, and for that I give this film high marks.

Much like a particular hard-boiled New York detective from the Eighties and a certain Navy SEAL cook from the Nineties, ex-Secret Service agent Mike Banning is about to have a very bad day. Luckily, this bad day is a real audience pleaser. In this moment in time, when films like "The Expendables" 1 and 2, "Bullet to the Head," "The Last Stand," and "A Good Day to Die Hard" are all vying for that nostalgic Eighties/early Nineties trip down action memory lane, "Olympus Has Fallen" wins over them all, completely taking the prize as the true meat and potatoes throwback to Regan-era extravaganzas that action junkies have been waiting for. I had the pleasure of doing coverage for this script ten years ago, while I was interning at a production company in Los Angeles. Fortunately, they kept the title. It always had the right ring to it. I am happy to say that the finished product, which I had the unique pleasure of viewing with the film's talented writers, Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt, is the same action ride that I read on paper a decade ago. It's refreshing to see writers Creighton and Katrin coming up with scenarios that are simply meant to impress the audience and take them on a ride. I am reminded of that moment when our wisecracking hero, Banning (Gerard Butler, back in pitch-perfect tough guy mode), has to go to the roof of the White House and destroy an out-of-control missile defense system. Seeing that type of adventurous scenario on the big screen again made me giddy and nostalgic. I love those moments, and I love these movies. In the age of PG-13 and/or watered-down-R action pictures, not to mention films that are entirely too short ("Die Hard 5," anyone?), the R-rated "Olympus Has Fallen," which runs at a pleasing two hours, is the definitive Guy's Action Popcorn Movie (thankfully not released on Valentine's Day), a throwback to the age of the fun ride. The White House has become a war zone after an amazing all-out assault by North Korean baddies (we're talking James Cameron-eque, "Black Hawk Down" technical precision and attention to detail. Kudos to director Antoine Fuqua). Modern audiences will be happy with camera choices that occasionally give us first-person-shooter scenarios. I loved the various scenes of hand-to-hand combat, as well as Banning's unapologetic view about getting the job done (look no further than his interrogation methods). In a nod to Schwarzenegger/Seagal-esque violence, one particularly vulgar and aggressive back and forth banter with main baddie Rick Yune is darkly funny and warranted, and a mid-point moment involving a bust of Lincoln is a literal knockout. The White House geography also is used well to appropriately brutal effect. There are moments where the lighting is similar to director/cinematographer Peter Hyams films ("Sudden Death," "The Relic"), movies that play with darkness and shadows and revel in them. Thus, in many instances, our hero, dressed in black (naturally cut from the same unstoppable cloth as one Mr. Seagal), emerges from the dark to dispense justice, and he could be lurking anywhere. One particular scene, as Banning walks down a hallway, gun pointed, illuminated only by a hanging halogen light, will remind you of the era of then-cinematographer Jan de Bont's "The Hunt for Red October."Although released in this uncertain and grim post-9/11 era, when there is necessary discussion about gun control (and I am very in favor of the idea), the film, with its gruesome, unapologetic action, frankly has the right tone that a throwback action movie needs. That night in the theater, I got my action movie fix. "Olympus Has Fallen" will be a definite Blu-ray purchase for me. I look forward to watching that White House assault scene again with my theater surround system. I congratulate Mr. Rothenberger and Ms. Benedikt on their first produced effort. Enjoy the ride and watch as Banning saves the day with the old-school attitude that takes a well deserved break from PG-13. Highly recommended.

This movie is an entertaining, action and tension filled thriller in the key of the Die Hard series where terrorists attack the White House from the inside and menace American society and have to be stopped by a disgraced lone wolf who wants to clear his name and save his country.From the dramatic opening scene to the tension filled ending, this movie is a breathless hunt. The action scenes are off course a little bit overproduced but it's better than other recent Hollywood flicks like "A Good Day to Die Hard" that simply go too far with their special effects and feel rather ridiculous in the end. The story line is definitely nothing new but the intensity and the surprisingly solid acting Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Melissa Leo, Morgan Freeman and antagonist Rick Yune make this movie one of the better of its popular and repetitive kind. On a personal note, I might also add supporting actress Malana Lea who doesn't have a big role but who perfectly incarnates the devil in disguise, a breathtaking beauty with a truly evil side. Nevertheless, the movie has a couple of flaws. It's not quite clear what happens to the First Lady in the beginning of the movie. I thought the accident scene on the bridge was somewhat strange. Was it a simple accident or an attack from the outside? The movie includes other strange moments. The role of the character played by Dylan McDermott remains mysterious. One gets no credible reason for his negative attitude as well as for his sudden change of mind. It's also strange that he isn't used by the main actor after his change of mind to mix up things in the bunker of the White House. His role could have been a lot more profound and he could have been the changing element of the whole story. Instead, his fate is quickly abandoned. Let's add also that even the intentions of the antagonists remain somewhat superficial. How did they all infiltrate the South Korean government as well as the United States of America and what are the true convictions and reasons behind their actions? I'm aware of the fact that this flick is meant to be a straight action thriller but a little bit more depth would have been a great deal as well to stand out of all these quite similar movies.Once again, I must also add that this film includes mild propaganda elements. It's not as evident as in "Red Dawn" but maybe similar to "Argo". Instead of choosing mafia bosses, radical American terrorists who want to destroy their own government or an international gangster organization, it had to be once again pro North Korea terrorists. This movie underlines in a subtle way how dangerous this American enemy could be and what could eventually happen if one didn't try to prevent them from doing what they do. I think that arts and politics shouldn't mix too much. There have been plenty of patriotic war movies after the 9/11 incident and they surely had their reasons to be there. After a few years, these patriotic movies disappeared but now they seem to have come back over the last three years or so for no apparent reason. These slight propaganda attitudes seem to have for goal to challenge the nation's enemies and to make people believe that the United States of America are still going strong despite the economic crisis and the events that made Afghanistan and Iraq a second or third Vietnam. I would have liked this movie more if the terrorists had not been stereotypes of an American enemy.Despite these few flaws, this movie is truly entertaining and among the strongest films of the not so young year 2013. I recommend you to watch this film in your local cinemas to be able to appreciate the great sound and special effects it has. As many people said, this is what the last "Die Hard" movie should have been.

This movie manages to deliver the goods in the action and suspense departments, even if the story is second-rate. I did find myself invested in the fate of the characters, but this could have been an even better movie if the villains were more threatening, and the victims in more peril, or if the tension had been ratcheted up a bit. Still, it's a pretty good movie, because it doesn't waste any time with any unnecessary material. Like "Die Hard 5", the film makes up for in action what it lacks in story. It's also the kind of the movie that opens in the summer.*** out of ****

Matt Damon stars in the Sci-fi/political thriller Elysium, Neill Blomkamp's follow up to District 9, along with Jodie Foster as Elysium's Secretary Delacourt and Sharlto Copley as the main villain Kruger. Is Elysium on par with Oscar nominated District 9? Absolutely NOT! Not even close but it is still a solid sci/fi entertainment. It is a more conventional film than its predecessor, which I was not expecting from Blomkamp.The film starts of very cliché and gave me some eye roll moments but it quickly picks itself up from reaching into mediocrity. They way it does this is by evoking political messages through out the film in relevance with today's society. Questioning our handling with immigration, military power, our health care. Which I found to be important in this film. Obviously me and Blomkamp share each others political stance. For anyone else it might seem like its trying to oversell its message.I felt most of the cast were very under used. Jodie Foster's character really didn't have much to work with. She was just there to move the plot forward. Matt Damon served his purpose as the lead but by no means of the imagination is this one of his best performances. They were all over shadowed by Sharlto Copley. My God, is he great as Kruger! Right away we are introduced into this provocative-sociopath with no regard for human life. The story really needed this kind of menacing character. He is by far the film's best positive. Another negative aspect of this film would be its pacing. When we are given emotional scenes they don't stay long enough to settle and doesn't give that emotional impact you were hoping for.Like District 9 it delivers on the the beautiful imagery. Using the very best Weta Workshop has to offer. From its big guns to the human-like robots, to the space station of Elysium. The action set pieces were just as exciting as its predecessor. The film really manages to capture all its budget on screen. My biggest issue comes from the excessive use of shaky cam. It was used when the characters were simply walking to the action sequences. I felt ninety percent of this film was shaky cam. Which got me a little dizzy since I ,unfortunately, got to sit in the very front of the theater. That might have something to do with it as well.Neill Blomkamp has established once again that he can compete with the best Directors of the genre films. Elysium shows more flaws than his first film but they are overwhelmed by its positive aspects, to me at least. It was not a disappointment and it was a solid popcorn entertainment and a smarter than average sci/fi film.

Just saw this in an advance screening, and wasted two hours. The biggest issue I had with the movie was that the characters were not sympathetic at all on any level. I could care less if the characters arrived on Elysium and in fact was hoping they wouldn't. There were so many glaring plot holes or things that were left unexplained. Like why did there seem to be zero vegetation on earth for the overpopulated earth citizens. Also the Kruger character was an absolute joke. He was a cross between Freddy Krueger and Brad Pitt in Snatch. He made nonstop commentary that you could only understand half the time. This movie tried to go action over plot and character, which could have been fine if not for the close up shaky cam. During most of the fight scenes you couldn't tell who was winning losing or being thrown against a wall. The movie was not worth the time, and I am glad that the pass was free. Do not bother with it.

Health care. Basically this movie is saying that health care should be free for all. Rich people get better health care and that's just not right. In fact, that's sort of evil.In this movie, people kill for health care. They use fancy weapons out of the District 9 movie. They use exoskeletons and high energy plasma stuff and it's very cool in theory, except they're fighting for health care and that's just... not the coolest thing to make a movie about.The bad guy starts off unhinged and ends up as a raving lunatic, but he's fun for the most part. He's the only thing fun about the movie really. Health care. Ugh. It's implied that all of America (or LA*) winds up overrun by Latinos. The whites (rich people) have evacuated to Elysium and they've taken health care with them. Matt Damon is the last white man on Earth, (or LA*), and he wants health care. And that's the gist of it.1hr 49mins of movie ensues.Annoying female character included. Annoying child included.Not the worst movie ever, but far from awesome.*They only show LA for the entire movie. No other city, no other country, no other continent. Very LA-centric.

Elysium was easily my most hyped up movie for the summer. Neil Blomkamp came into the scene a few years ago with the amazing film district 9, so Elysium has been long anticipated. So the question is does it live up to all the hype and can it reach the level that district 9 did? Unfortunately the answer is no. Unlike District 9 the story here is a very simple one, with no real sense of political/controversial undertones, and that is a shame because Elysium's plot is perfect for this. Instead we get a very generic story with no real surprises and unfortunately Blomkamp decided to play it safe here. Now Elysium is not an awful movie by any means, in fact it's good but it the problem here is that it's weighted down by it's simplicity. The camera-work and soundtrack also hurt Elysium in a sense that the sound and music are almost non existent, and the camera work looks like it was filmed to be in 3d but then they opted out making it seem almost like a video game. Matt Damon brings in a decent performance but it is Sharlto Copley here who steals the show with his role as the villain. It's going to be a big year for sci-fi films but i would highly recommend watching the unrated sci-fi film oblivion over this. Elysium ends up playing it safe and becoming generic with no real surprises. There is a grand setting here but they never take advantage of that fact. Hopefully Blomkamp can get back on track with his next film, but i do expect great things to come from him in the near future. While not awful, Elysium proves to be somewhat of a disappointment. Rating : 6 out of 10

So bad. They don't make you care about ANY of the characters and the storytelling is awful. You barely get to see Elysium, it's just like 3 guys in sweaters in a country club drinking champagne for like 5 seconds, and there's a little bit of grass and a few trees. Like really? That didn't even look that cool. **Spoiler I guess** Matt Damon is dying the whole movie from some exposure to radiation, and that is the only reason he is trying to go to Elysium. They should have at least made that little girl his secret daughter or something, so that you could actually care about him saving her. Her mongoose and hippo story was painful to watch, even thought it was the only time Matt Damon and the little girl actually interacted. Kruger (the main villain) was okay I guess. He had a cool accent and beard, but he wasn't that tough or threatening though.It was just some Mexican people on post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, with no health care and dirty clothes, and Matt Damon dying for a few days. Then he gets some tech-suit that makes him a tiny bit stronger and he punches like one guy and then nothing happens. They should show people on Elysium freaking out and worrying about people from Earth coming. The people on Elysium did nothing except swim in a pool and sit on a chair.The only cool thing on Elysium was that bed that healed people. I mean couldn't they have a little more cool futuristic stuff? Touchscreens? Cool shirts or sunglasses? More sci-fi stuff. I mean it is the year 2154, I would think technology would be a lot more advanced. Jodie Foster's control room had like CRT monitors it was so bad. The robot animations and models were well done though.The story and characters weren't developed at all, and there was barely any action. I haven't seen District 9, but there's no way it can be as bad as this. I really wanted to like it, because the trailer and concept looked awesome. I usually like Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Diego Luna and their acting was fine, but this movie could have been so much better if they fixed the story. I felt like Matt Damon didn't really give a crap about helping all the people on Earth, and he never even made out with the hot chick...I love the concept surrounding the themes about health care, wealth inequality, social status and immigration, but nothing really tied it all together or developed these themes and this is what was missing. That's what this movie should be about, not some guy who is dying and doesn't want to die. It should have been about resistance, and inspire you to want to make a difference in the way we currently live.

Wow! I just finished seeing Elysium I must say that director Neill Blomkamp is definitely growing as a filmmaker. As in his prior work  despite the impressive technology, he focuses on the human factor which elevates the movie than just mere blow-up shootem up film. He has definitely made something new once again. The movie stars Max(Matt Damon) as he grows up with Frey(Alice Braga)  though their lives take different paths as they grow up it intersects like an explosion later in life. The basis of the movie is that people living on earth are living in desperation and day by day. There are pockets of rich people but mostly to build ships, sophisticated robots and anything else the very rich needs. The rich actually live in a space station called Elysium which is not only a living habitat but it actually keep people without any sickness and in a good environment. Something people on earth no longer have. Max (used to be a thief) is now a factory worker making robots, but one day due to an accident he is expose to too much radiation and has 5 days to live. Prior to that he meets Frey again who is now a nurse with a very sick daughter. Max tries to get to Elysium for a cure but the only way to get there is through Spider(played by Wagner Moura) and doing it underground, but 1srt Max has to be equip with a 3rd generation exoskeleton which allows him to be faster and stronger. Unfortunately, the person in charge of protecting Elysium is Delacourt(Jodie Foster) who is very ambitious and utilizes an agent name Kruger(well played by Sharlto Copley) with all the means at his disposal to achieve to stop anything from reaching Elysium or even if reach to stop them at all cost. With Spider downloads unto Max a program meant to "reboot" Elysium and possibly change everyone's lives but what ensues is a battle between the haves and have-nots that's decided only by one side completely dying or transformed. the human factor definitely keeps the movie grounded. Is bloody, is not for the meek but like everything it serves it's purpose.

Elysium has such an intriguing concept, I went into the film very eager and excited for Blomkamp's follow-up to District 9, thinking he'd overcome his flaws. But after viewing Elysium, I've come to the conclusion he needs a writing partner.This film takes place in 2154 after a prologue establishing the wealthy have fled the now overpopulated and polluted Earth in favor of a space-retreat called Elysium. Earth citizens try their best to ensure passage to Elysium on the black market, but they never succeed thanks to Jodie Foster's Secretary of Defense, Delacourt. These people, it establishes quickly, want access to the medical technology held on Elysium (early in the film a mother cures her daughter of her severe fractures in one of these pods). Think now on how neat a concept it is: the Earth has become a slum and their put all of their effort to MAYBE be healed on Elysium. Getting up and being in perfect health for the few minutes is enough for them. All political implications aside, Blomkamp has thought up a hell of a dystopia. Earth is no less interesting, however he never follows up on either of these.What I enjoyed about District 9 was how immersed we became with the prawn slum, and how unconventionally we became so. Elysium lacks this. It's very much a straight shot, cause-and- effect plot. It's very much amateur writing. Elysium lacks any trace of dramatic irony, though I noticed multiple instances where it would be necessary, and also any sort of character development (jodie Foster seemed to exist only as a catalyst for the plot).The story follows Max (Matt Damon, who does a very good job adding certain depth to an otherwise listless character), as he is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. This starts the ball rolling on him getting to Elysium to be healed. He agrees to pull off a dangerous mission in order to secure unauthorized space passage, but he finds himself in more of a jam when he becomes the only cerebral carrier of a program to overthrow Elysium's government. SOmewhere along the way he meets childhood friend, Frey, but she doesn't add much. She just confuses the plot, since their history is never told, nor is she at all developed.Where the film shines is in its visual direction, both cinematography and action. Elysium had a much better reason for its action occurring than District 9, but it also planned out its action better. Since Max was suffering from severe radiation poisoning, he was given an exoskeleton to keep him fit as a fiddle (you'll need to suspend your disbelief for much of this) and he ended up taking on the wonderful villain, Kruger. This leads to many fight scenes. However, Blomkamp would splice random shots of slow-motion to add structure to the action so you never really feel lost, though you may still get sort of dizzy. He also had some neat camera tricks where he would twist the angle mid-scene so the action did not get as boring. I also enjoyed how Max and Kruger's fights were more battle-of-wits than just duking it out. Max learned from his prior mistakes in fighting against Kruger.This is, above all else, a very entertaining film. Blomkamp (from whom I expect much more in the future) kept the plot concise and the cinematography and special effects are absolutely beautiful. It's easy to follow and its political implications are smart and relevant. Don't expect any surprises, but it does pretty well at making what you expect fun to watch. It's just a good summer flick.

Like bad action movies of the past with a big budget but no brain, (Can you say Reloaded? Can you say Revolutions? Can you now say Man of Steel?) This movie pretends to be smart but ultimately there was no thought put into it on any level other then how to make an overall socialist agenda look cool. Even the action scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacks any real energy. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma. Yes, even the normally charismatic Matt Damon spends the film in pouty face with nothing deep to do. I know the characters are facing horribly depressing events but those monotone performances, interrupted by bursts of anger, are terrible. Since the movie tries to put some sort of emphasis on a theme, this was a serious problem. This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as their setup and overuse flowed for far too long. Just like the Matrix sequels, this movie works as eye candy for a combined 15 minutes of its running time. The rest is crap.To reiterate, what sinks the movie is that it lacks a sense of wonder and never emotionally connects with us. Sure, the CGI isn't bad but that clearly isn't enough in today's digital day and age. YAWN. Elysium is yet another victim of the spend more and think less way to make movies. You couldn't pay me enough to see it twice.

This film is...wow. Just as impressive as District 9, yet far different. Superior in many respects there is a SCENE in this Jesus Christ....wow. You'll know it when you see it an ICONIC science fiction sequence done with I'm guessing 100% practical effects ....just omg it will blow your mind. this scene I'm talking about is as good as that guys chest opening up in The Thing, or the egg to Cane sequence in Alien Blomkamp is incredible. Nothing is underwhelming.Jodie Foster is actually perfect in this. I was skeptical at first since I see her as a "hero" actor..always being in things like Contact and such. But she does the villain role well and puts on this strange futuristic accent. Alice Braga was also good. I was skeptical about her too as she hadn't impressed me with anything else I've seen her in..but she was a perfect fit for this.Sharlto Copley .....iconic science fiction villain. Cleaning house in dat second half : )Damon was perfect in his role too. I'm glad they ended up going with him. He wasn't bland either. he had this really authentic way of coming across like an everyday manthe whole complexity of the plot just felt organic and fully cared for my only quam was not seeing much (if any) of the Elysium civilian residents.A solid science fiction film, with multiple threads that give the characters motivation. They didn't spoil these in their marketing either, so there were many complete surprises.about the controversy The messages are there, but they are universal to the human condition. People can try to fit things as an opposing political views, but in the end you can't really argue with it unless you're a ...em completely lacking in empathy? The situation seemed foreseeable as well. 10/10I look forward to Chappie and we will have a little Blomkamp trilogy :)

Elysium is such a massively underwhelming movie.The action scenes are just way below the bar that's already been set by action movies of 2013 and 2012. What action there is is ruined by a shaky camera and blatantly poor choreographing. It tries to make up for this by being a "LOOK AT ALL THIS COOL FUTURE STUFF" movie with robots, magic healing stations, "futuristic" weaponry, and the tired dystopian theme.As a science fiction movie it's just awful. There's a plot hole every 15 minutes, issues that are never addressed, and terrible writing altogether. The science part is never in any way explained — this would be better billed as a science fantasy film. It makes absolutely no effort to be anything other than another cheesy "sci-fi" film to throw in the bin along with After Earth It takes after District 9 in that it's trying to be a social commentary but falls flat on its face so hard it's almost amusing.The "message" of the film is like any other film being released lately: being socially privileged is wrong. It's yet another film that sets out to make you feel shameful for living in a first world country for no other reason than the fact that it seems to sell really well lately.Honestly, I give it a 4/10 meaning it wasn't quite painful to watch, but it was pretty difficult to enjoy. The humor (at least I HOPE it was intended as humor) kept me from outright leaving the theatre and that's really all it has going for it in my opinion.That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad movie. It just means it's way below average. If you haven't seen much sci-fi and you don't want to think too hard (and in fact staunchly refuse to pick it apart) then it's a fantastic movie for you otherwise, don't bother.

'Elysium' starring Matt Damon is the perfect summer popcorn movie. It has everything you would want in a movie; a great cast that serves their purpose and visceral special effects that might even land the team an Oscar. Everything including all the fight scenes were executed flawlessly. Coming out of this movie I had close to no complaints. The writing was a bit dodgy in some areas, but the great acting and effects quickly draw you back into the story. Neil Blomkamp, who dazzled audiences with district nine 4 years prior, does a fantastic job once again with this flick. His vision made the story very real to movie goers everywhere. Overall 'Elysium' is worth every penny to watch in theater.

Neill Blomkamp's "Elysium" is far more flawed than his debut "District 9", yet it is still skillful summer entertainment and a worthy continuation of the thematic backdrop that Blomkamp has set in the latter - futuristic social inequality. This film however takes the quote "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer" to orbital heights, literally, as the eponymous 2001-esque space colony gets filled to the brim with the wealthy while the rest of the poor folks gets damned on a vastly overpopulated Earth. Here in Los Angeles, a criminal named Max (Damon) struggles to board Elysium after a freak accident, while corruption and paranoia seethes through Elysium official Delacourt (Foster).This social commentary on whether society is doomed by their own doing is used as a clothesline for frenetic sequences of violent action, all combined to form one feature-length race against time for the underdog to triumph over all. Thing is, the underdog has to face an even crazier dog, a disgruntled and psychopathic mercenary named Kruger hired by Delacourt to off Max for, um, doing good stuff. Sharlto Copley, the flawed protagonist in Blomkamp's previous effort, plays a despicable and barbaric villain so well here that he's in danger of being typecast as such, as opposed to Matt Damon who can play an action hero in his sleep. Even when Damon suits up in a clunky brain-controlled exo-skeleton following the accident, we root for him because he's a clear underdog that the audience supports.Blomkamp's screenplay is flawed, with certain gaps of physical logic here and there, and the story seems cobbled from previous superior sci- fi classics. But where his screenplay fails, it's his direction and vision that delivers. Blomkamp successfully materializes two different worlds - rich and poor - in technical aspects, and presents them as a black-and-white prophecy. Gritty scenes in the L.A. slums on Earth are compelling to watch when compared starkly to the spectacular-looking utopia-like Elysium. Any space colony that can rebuild exploded faces is a colony worth living on, no? It must've been a challenge for production designer Philip Ivey to come up with concepts for both sides, but he succeeds.Which brings me to the other factor - the action sequences, and Blomkamp delivers thoroughly on that aspect. Frantic action sequences mixed with crowd-pleasing and squeamish moments made me realize - here is a modern- day filmmaker who knows action, and what his audience wants and keeps on that promise. In my opinion they were far more exhilarating and refreshing to watch than any other movie this summer, as they provide no shortage of old school bloody thrills - and I do mean bloody."Elysium" may be flawed and familiar story-wise as it should have been half an hour longer with more scenes set in the colony, but it still has a thought-provoking concept and enough action to vastly satisfy both the popcorn crowd and the action crowd. This is a summer blockbuster that delivers.

Of all the genre's out there, science fiction seems to be the one rarely getting it right these days. When Neill Blomkamp burst onto the screen with his gritty racial commentary film District 9 it changed the genre for the better. Now he is back with his latest look at the future with Elysium and is bringing Matt Damon along for the ride. The trailers looked to deliver a similar vision of his previous film, but does it pack the same punch both in the story as well as visually?Elysium follows a man desperate to get to Elysium, a space station where the very wealthy live in a pristine world, while the rest of the human race remain on an overpopulated ruined Earth. With nothing left to lose, he takes on a mission against Elysium's secretary Delacourt and the entire system to save himself as well as the millions of others on Earth. Once again Blomkamp has created a film that not only entertains but has numerous levels of social commentary without ever getting overly preachy. This time out there seems to be the health care system, over population, and pollution that all make up this world these characters inhabit. Matt Damon continues to deliver with him really stepping it up even more than usual here. What is great about his character is that he feels more like a normal guy with flaws and a reluctant hero forced into this situation as opposed to wanting to be there. You feel his desperation and in turn can imagine the rest of the planet and what they are going through. District 9 star Sharlto Copley plays a completely different type of character and is a complete badass. He steals every scene he is in and is near unrecognizable in this role. Every time he steps on screen you know something great is going to happen. The always great William Fichtner has a brief but not surprisingly good presence here. Jodi Foster is the only that just doesn't seem to work all that well. Her performance felt forced at times and she seemed to float in and out of the strange accent she is trying to use. The visuals are gritty, dirty, and beautiful all at once and are the main catalyst to make this film come to life. There is plenty of action here and at first seems to be playing it a bit safe, but quickly proves otherwise as the film moves forward.This is one of the best science fiction films to come along in some time and has everything you could possibly want. Most will just watch this movie and see the action spectacle and cool visuals, but this film is so much more. Pay attention to the story and what it is trying to tell you and this film will have a greater effect on you. Some of the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more, but overall still gets the message across all while delivering a bad ass action science fiction film that should not be missed.

Once again Neil Blomkamp stuffs a political pill in the center of a doughy ball and presents it as tasty science fiction treat. This is Neil's second attempt at story telling subterfuge; first time was with District 9's South Africa's Apartheid issue and now again with his personal view on America's immigration policy in Elysium. This is the last time I'm sucked into Blomkamp's shinny lights of a sci-fi flick only to be duped with his personal political opinions. Oh by the way the movie wasn't even good. Please don't misunderstand me, apartheid and immigration are real issues that deserve serious attention, but I go to the movies to take a break from them not be subjected to your personal opinion of them Neil, I watch the news for that. If you really feel the need to see this movie, save yourself the dime and rent District 9, Elysium recycles most of its props, scenes, agendas and originally from there.

The summer movie season is wrapping up soon. Hollywood had a great start this season with the "Star Trek" and "Iron Man" franchises' latest adventures kicking it off, as well as a polarizing adaptation of "The Great Gatsby" that I had more fun with than I was anticipating. Then we saw "Man of Steel", a movie that for many fell short of expectations. But these films, as with most films that we see playing in the cinema, weren't original ideas, they were sequels or reboots. We needed something more, and sure "Pacific Rim" was a great original take on a giant monster flick, but something that was more than just a summer popcorn movie had to be somewhere out there. Now we come to the end of our summer journey, and our wishes have been met with "Elysium".Neill Blomkamp's "Elysium" blends his signature top-notch sci-fi action with an intelligent plot, something that we've come to expect after his last feature, "District 9". And although "District 9" had a smarter and more intricate story, "Elysium" is no slouch. "Elysium" appears to touch on many current issues in today's society, such as illegal immigration, health care, and the power of the elite few over the masses in general. The film takes place roughly 140 years from now on an overpopulated and polluted Earth that is orbited by a space station paradise called Elysium. Only the rich can afford to live on the space station. There is no war and there are machines that can cure nearly anything including cancer, so its citizens have virtually nothing to fear, as they go about their lives on the man-made Heaven. Our hero, Max, played by none other than Matt Damon, is of course one with the masses trapped on the hellish Earth and he must fight for what he and his fellow Earthlings deserve. Preventing Max from reaching his goal of getting to Elysium is the film's main antagonist, Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley, who starred as the protagonist in "District 9". Shartlo kills it in this role, being one of the most intimidating villains on screen this year. Kruger is an psychotic agent living on Earth who must prevent the civilians from escaping to Elysium. He is truly unpredictable in his actions which include blowing people to bits (something that Blomkamp loved to do in District 9) as well as harming women and children to get what he wants. The story builds to a terrific, action packed climax that is sure to leave everyone on the edge of their seats. Though Copley's performance stood out, Damon's was near perfect and helped carry the masterpiece. Jodie Foster plays a corrupted Defense Secretary very well, and William Fichtner is great as a mean-spirited businessman. All in all, "Elysium" was the most fun I had in the theater all year and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see an intelligent action movie that takes place in the future but comments on issues in the present.

Elysium is an energetic science fiction action thriller featuring Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, and Sharlto Copley. Neil Blomkamp certainly aims to please, especially fans of District 9, as both the movies share many similar elements. A crock-pot full action and violence, and spiced with a few humorous moments, we follow our hero as he struggles to live within the future L.A. slums that are packed to the brim with the poor and unfortunate. You can almost hear the monotone chant; "bring out your dead" over and over again. Meanwhile, up in the confines of space, the rich and fortunate live in utter bliss on the rotating space station, Elysium, free from the disarray of Earth life. The story rages on, heavy with themes of justice and equality for all, as our hero stumbles upon something that could change the course of history, and bring the two worlds back together again, and save those who really need it. Matt Damon's character is believable enough, with Jodie Foster coming in as a ruthless commander and politician of Elysium. Both do a good job, but the real winner here is Sharlto Copley, who emerges as a completely new type of character than that in District 9, one who is eccentric, dangerous, and malicious. Along with a fun array of new weapons, robots, and fun ways to be blown up, Sharlto Copley adds that special touch of uniqueness that elevates the level of fun. It would be unfair to also give praise to the special effects of the film, which looks marvelous on a big screen. The cinematography is well done, adding a few new filming methods, and improving on old techniques to help elevate the feel of the movie. One could question the racial undertones that define the living standards of each way of life, and one could also nit-pick the realism of this future world, and Wolverine-ish superpowers of Matt Damon. However, the movie does share a moral of what a beautiful planet Earth truly is, and gives us a good lesson in gratitude. While it panders to the action and sci-fi junkie, it also allows room for just about anybody to envelope its positive themes and appreciate the courage and strength of the characters. However, it's main purpose, is to entertain, and blow you away. And this movie does just that.

This was one this year that i was looking forward to and i can see now that my expectations may have been set just a little too high. This isn't to say that this film is any way bad by any means, I just wanted a little more from everything: I wanted more from Jodie foster, i wanted more from Matt Damon and Alice Braga, i wanted a few more minutes of action sequences, and i wanted more of Sharlto Copely. The acting is solid on all fronts and especially well done on Sharlto's part, i would say that he stole the show as performances go as the menacing sociopath Kruger. Everything in this film is done so well i just felt the credits rolled just a little too soon and honestly i just wanted a little more from the story and a little more character development all around. Still a very solid film and not even remotely bad to any extent and worth the price of admission.

Neill Blomkamp is still a bit of a rookie in the film industry despite delivering 2009's smash hit "District 9". Now that it has been a few years and he's parted ways with his big time collaborator Peter Jackson, Blomkamp is carving out his own path in Hollywood by making another piece of original sci-fi in the form of this summer's bookend blockbuster, "Elysium". Can "Elysium" deliver a compelling piece of summer science fiction or does Blomkamp get caught in the infamous sophomore slump?Read the Full Review: http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/elysium-review/

2 hours of liberal wet dream propaganda. We want open borders, everyone deserves to be a citizen, everyone is entitled to universal health care, all rich people are bad, all rich people are white BS. I don't normally write reviews but TRUST ME this turd has ZERO redeeming qualities. Terrible casting, terrible acting, terrible effects (at one point you can see the fake tattoo peeling off of Damon's skin) WAY over the top language, ultra violence and gore. All in all, that's two hours of getting preached at by Elitist leftists that I will not get back. STAY AWAY. Better to go watch SHARKNADO again. Seriously, Elysium is "America" and the earth is Mexico. I'm not kidding, even the Russian speak Spanish! I am SO sick of these people making crap like this. You want to get preached at by hypocrites for 2 hours be my guest but just know going into it it what it is. HORRID.

After director Neill Blomkamp's fantastic debut film District 9 I was understandably eager to see his new sci-fi film Elysium. Unfortunately his second feature doesn't quite match up with the greatness that was District 9.Visually the film is quite stunning and it has some great cinematography when it comes to the larger shots. The CGI effects are excellent and blend in well with the environment. The Earth of the film looks very gritty, believable and lived-in and the space station Elysium has this very sterile and futuristic look to it. You could really buy it that Earth could look like this with many decades of neglect and poverty. Everything's in disrepair and in decline. The rich on the other hand have every resource available to them in their own little paradise in space. The set and production designers truly did a great job with the locations. Matt Damon is decent as the film's protagonist Max who is an ex-con now working on assembling the droids which keep order on the now overpopulated Earth. His role and the writing of his character isn't anything too special or memorable but he does what he can with it. He's just a no nonsense guy who is thrown into a difficult situation. He was also quite sarcastic and funny when he was dealing with the droids in the earlier part of the film but we didn't see this side of him at all after that. Alice Braga plays Max's childhood friend Frey with whom Max meets up again when he's an adult. I didn't feel much of an emotional connection or chemistry between them though and that hampered the film a bit. Their back story is told almost completely in sentimental flashback sequences which I didn't care for. The antagonists in this film were very one-dimensional and over the top. Jodie Foster plays Elysium's defense minister Delacourt and Sharlto Copley (who was also in District 9) plays an undercover agent named Kruger who is positioned on Earth. They're both very cliché and uninteresting. The writing of all the characters wasn't very good at all in this film and I didn't get emotionally invested in any of them. The story isn't that great either and this then also takes away from the film's many action sequences because we don't have that big a stake in them. The film starts quite strongly as it juxtaposes the situation on Earth and on Elysium to highlight the problems of social and economic inequality. Then suddenly when the action starts, these issues fade far in to the background in favor of more and more action. From the trailers and the hype I really got this impression that the film would deal with these issues in a thoughtful manner. Regrettably this is not the case with this film. A big problem with the film is also that none of the characters seems to learn anything new or change their beliefs or anything like that. A huge part of the success of District 9 was in seeing how the main character evolved after spending some time with the aliens. In Elysium the good guys are the good guys and bad guys are the bad guys. There's no complexity, nuance or subtlety in any of them. We also don't get to meet any other citizens of Elysium beside the higher up leaders like defense minister Delacourt and president Patel. It would've been interesting to see the common people of Elysium and how they react to the situation, what their beliefs are and what drives them. The writing is also a little too pointed out and heavy-handed. Some of it just made me think "Wow, really?". For example, at one point the CEO of the droid production company literally tells some mid-level manager not to breathe at his direction. Things also seem to happen way too conveniently to push the plot along. Then again you could say this about many films but you really start to pay attention to these things when you're not completely engrossed in the film. This film surely would've benefited from a more subtle approach. The ending was also way too simplistic for my taste.The action in this film is quite intense and it looks very impressive at times. The exoskeletons were fun and looked convincing. Then comes the shaky cam. Oh boy. It's really quite annoying and very often it's hard to see what's going on. They should've really taken a page from the Bourne movies on how to shoot action scenes. Luckily the shaky cam isn't there all the time but the action could've definitely been improved with a clearer shooting style.All in all, the film has decent action with absolutely gorgeous visuals and it moves along at a good pace. Sadly the writing, the plot and the characters aren't that interesting and it's hard to get emotionally invested in this film. It's watchable and probably quite entertaining if you're in the proper mood for it. For me, the film ultimately left me a bit cold and disappointed.

Elysium is your standard tale of the struggle between the upper class and the poor...with robots and space ships in the year 2154. (The fact there's even THAT MUCH of Los Angeles left in 2154 is amazing on its own.) The rich have moved from a dying earth to the massive space station Elysium, and everyone not rich is forbidden to go. Also, Elysium has video-game-like healing stations that cure everything. EVERYTHING. And since you can barely get an Advil back on earth, the people stuck there are not too happy about it. Matt Damon plays your standard guy- raised-in-an-orphanage-wishing-he-wasn't-so-poor, while Jodie Foster plays the I-don't-give-a-flying-f*ck, shoot-first-ask-later head of security for Elysium.Pros: - The first thing that will grab you is the scenery. Earth looks beaten down, but it looks fantastic in its devastation. Elysium looks like a dream world. The inner-core of Elysium looks like something straight out of Aperture Laboratories. (Portal, anyone?) - Jodie Foster plays a MEAN villain. And that's good. - Sharlto Copley, the star of District 9, has got some serious acting flexibility. He plays a grizzled mercenary that is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of his D9 character, but you'd never recognize him until the end credits. - The SHOOTING action scenes are very cool. Cons: - I specified earlier that the shooting action scenes are good, because the FIGHTING action scenes are terrible. When anyone goes hand-to-hand, the camera shakes WAY TOO MUCH. I know that this is becoming a style for many movies, but...I hate it. You literally cannot make out what is happening. All I can think about is that there's a camera guy running behind the scene, who can't hold the camera properly. It's enough to give you a headache. STOP DOING THIS, MOVIES. - Matt Damon is...eh...dry. He just doesn't do much for the character. Seems like he phoned it in. - I hate to say it about a Neill Blomkamp-written movie, but the script just isn't that strong. I would have wanted more time for Jodie Foster to flex some acting muscle, and less time for Matt Damon to fumble through awkward confrontations. I never really got attached to any of the characters.Be warned - there is some graphic violence. Elysium is not a bad sci-fi action flick, but it could have been much better. It's going to fall well short of some of the other sci-fi flicks we've seen this summer. (Star Trek, Pacific Rim) Elysium scores a 3 out of 5 on the BDBOS.(If you enjoyed this review...well then, you have good taste. And you're probably very good looking.

First of all I really missed Sharlto Copley's heavy South African accented f-bombs. It is great to hear them again.That being said lets get on the review. You can point one constant fact about Neill Blomkamp so far. He does not mind about being politically correct , non -offensive , family friendly or child/studio/box office friendly , PG-rated work. In his productions he shares what he thinks with audience , sparing nothing about his vision of where we are or where we are heading , putting effective real life examples or analogies about main themes or subjects of his scripts. You might not agree about him. But he creates a controversy a discussion about issues we can not ignore. That is his strength and what makes his movies so fun , interesting. Not like Disney funded banal and boring comic book stuff which became shallow formulatic and predictable as hell just to make BO profit by trying to appeal everyone and we are forced to watch on screen every year. District 9 ( which was a great piece of work) was about racism , xenophobia and apartheid. It struck hard. Elysium is about massive illegal immigration , health care , social/income inequality we are forced to face more and more each passing day. Blomkamp basically says that we can not afford to ignore them anymore. Though the actions of main protagonist Max DeCosta we are faced with a desperate man driven to desperate means. In 150 years Earth became a gigantic slum , a Barrio from Mexico City. (most of the film was produced there so it is not surprising ) Pollution , over population , automation of certain services and extension of life created a hell on the planet. When Max played by an subdued Matt Damon has a fatal work accident in the plant he was working (did I mention that Work Safety Regulations , Employee Rights , Unions all vanished as well ) that will cause his demise in a few days he goes on a path that will either save him or kill him a few days earlier. Desperate people and their actions. Alice Braga as Frey Max's childhood crush and Wagner Moura as Spider tag along as well. Then there is Elysium. A huge O'Neill class rotating space station in high orbit of Earth , an orbital habitat , a paradise for humans. A place where extreme pleasure , health care and life can be experienced through technology that was denied to masses. Jodie Foster who emphasizes her detachment from humanity by her fluent speaking French discussion in her first scene then orders shuttles full of immigrants approaching Elysium to be shot down coldly plays Defense Minister of Station Delacourt who oversees tight immigration procedures and makes no one who does not belong to a rich privileged class comes to station. She is OK with this character. But from antagonist types from the movie two other characters over shines her. First company CEO John Carlyle who is played by sharp cold uncompromising straight William Fichtner. The other is great Sharlto Copley who plays a sociopathic , unpredictable creepy South African mercenary / bounty hunter named Kruger. He is basically dealing with dirty work on Earth for Elysium administration.CGI and other visual effects along with camera work is great in my opinion. Droids are cool and cold without any sense of empathy or emotion. Action is great but not over the top or oh look Green Screen overload type of thing. It is adequate.What this movies missing I think is overall sharpness or much more uncompromising attitude of District 9. That movie dealt with our world and our society in a much more harsher , "in your face" way. Here Blomkamp seems to take a back step , made Elysium s little more audience friendly maybe probably due to studio pressure. Another disappointment is script's similarity to District 9. Characters , their motivations , sequence of events are all to similar. One might even say that Sharlto Copley called his workmate David James from District 9 and asked him how to act like a crazed mercenary. Still one hell of a movie definitely one to be watched in theater with big screen. 7,5 would be closer to my final rating.

As a huge fan of writer/ director Neil Blomkamp's District 9, I couldn't wait to see what he came up with next. Now after a 4 year wait, his sophomore flick Elysium has arrived. I liked Elysium. I was certainly entertained but, it does have some problems that keep it from reaching the standard set by District 9 such as, a bit of an overloaded story and some surprising overacting by a few principles. Elysium tells the story of the future Earth of 2154. The planet is overpopulated and ravaged and the rich and powerful have moved off planet to the enormous space station of Elysium where they have every convenience and luxury, while the rest are left to labor and wallow in the mess. Enter ex-con Max, (Matt Damon) a man trying to work hard and stay out of trouble and prison, while dreaming of reconnecting with childhood sweetheart, Frey (Alice Braga). An accident at work leaves Max fatally poisoned with radiation and with 5 days left to live, Max needs to get to the only place where he can be cured, Elysium which is off limits to the poor inhabitants of Earth. Max turns to crime-lord and hacker, Spider (Wagner Moura). Spider will get Max on Elysium if he helps steal the information about all it's access codes stored in the brain of one, John Carlyle (William Fichtner) who, unknown to Max and Spider, is working with Elysium Secretary Of Defense, Delacourt (a surprisingly miscast Jodie Foster) to overthrow Elysium's president (Faran Tahir). Still with me? Needless to say Max now has information that Delacourt will kill to get and is being hunted by her henchman, Kruger (Sharlto Copley) all the while trying to find his way to Elysium to heal himself. Throw in strength enhancing exo-skeletons, Frey's sick daughter and we have a Sci-Fi action soup with a lot of ingredients. Elysium does have a bit of an overcomplicated story and while it is not hard to follow, it just has a lot of elements to it as, once again, Blomkamp tackles the theme of 'the haves and the have-nots, as he did in District 9. We get the contrast of the over populated slum Earth has become to the spotless and perfect living conditions the wealthy enjoy in Elysium which, floats above in Earth's orbit as a constant reminder of how little we all are to them and how they are so above us. The message is not subtle but, Blomkamp skillfully keeps it from overwhelming things with so much else going on. There is a lot of fast paced action and with a complex story as we have, the director keeps things moving very quickly. The excess of plot doesn't slow things down though one feels it might have served the film if things were streamlined a little bit and there weren't quite so many players in the game. And as for the players, Damon and Braga are strong though Braga's Frey really doesn't get that much screen time till the last act so we don't identify with her as much even though we do get treated to flashbacks of she and Max as kids in an orphanage. Damon proves once again he can be an action star yet with some nice depth, giving Max some layers that enhances his character much like his surgically attached exo-skeleton enhances his strength and agility. Sadly it's veteran actress Foster who seems to be miscast here. She never quite strays into camp but, plays Delacourt like one half stereotypical bureaucratic douche and the other half Roger Moore era Bond villain complete with unidentifiable accent. It sticks out awkwardly in what is a serious Sci-Fi flick as does District 9 star Sharlto Copley, who is completely over the top as Kruger. Which is disappointing consider how good he was in D9. A calmer demeanor would have made him more threatening. Neither characterization seems to fit in with the more grounded performances of the leads and more serious tone of the film. Joining them is Wagner Moura who is just weak and tries to compensate by over doing it as Spider. An actor with a bit stronger presence who doesn't need to try as hard would have worked better. But, there is still plenty to like about this film. It's story may be complicated but, there is a lot of action to move it along and some delightfully gruesome moments splattered here and there as this future's weapons do make a mess. The last act especially is quite thrilling and has a nice emotional impact to go with all the explosions, gunfire and mechanically enhanced hand to hand combat. The SPFX are flawless, the design is breathtaking and the film could easily take place in District 9′s world. The score by Ryan Amon suits the film well, though reminded me of Dark Knight Rises a bit, but, that's not necessarily a bad thing. So, all in all I liked Elysium and recommend it especially if you enjoyed District 9. It's a bit meatier then most summer fair so, those who are tired of moody superheroes might like being given a bit more to chew on. Just be prepared that there is a complex story to digest along with the action and that a few of the veteran cast members just don't seem right for their roles. Entertaining despite it's flaws and another strong role from the versatile Damon.

After his refreshing debut, "District 9", it was only a matter of time before Neill Blomkamp helmed another great story. "Elysium" is original and well-crafted. Keep it up young auteur. Now some highly-needed criticisms:1) Lose that {uckin shaky camera business! It jars the audience from the excellent world which you have obviously laboriously created. If a member of your audience somehow is crazy enough to feel inclined to have the screen shake, let him bob his own head askance, in juxtaposition to that canvas on which the story unfolds. The rest of us can peacefully enjoy the visual feast without any distractions. Why all these modern directors feel they must shake their cameras so kinetically is beyond me. It probably illustrates how humans are merely good at being copycats even when what they are copying has no merit at all. I call it the 'silly but mammoth momentum of societal-pressure'.2) Consider an alternative means of confrontation besides the perennial 'ear-roaring fight or car chase' between your protagonist and antagonist in the final act. It seems like most of these Hollywood movies are being made to some formula: no matter the story, the final act must have that 'ear-roaring fight or car chase'. It is so boring! Not to mention so foolish! Here is an idea: make it more realistic and have your protagonist use his brains to outwit his foe. In real life, if his existence were really that threatened, that is what he would invariably do. For unlike a video game, you do not get a second life in real life after you have been killed. Naturally, this has the sensible effect of making all humans hesitant, careful and conservative about engaging their foes. So make it realistic, or barring that, at least plausible, by having the protagonist outwit using more of his brains than attempting to subdue with mere brawn. And do so without breaking the cardinal rule of story-telling. For the cardinal rule of story- telling is, "tell the story with such verisimilitude and such steadiness of hand that your audience is completely immersed; no longer are they then just listening to a story but rather living those chain of events themselves." We are story- telling creatures whom themselves are constituted of stories after all. Remember that!3) Focus more on your characters, their motivations, etc. In other words, more characterizations, and dramatizations and less, 'let's just pile on the action!'. It is the well-presented character that would organically lead to 'action' if his or her situation demands it. And let the camera linger, dammit! The audience is a voyeur. Or have you forgotten that one too?For an example of how a master director after creating a world, is comfortable enough with his craft to let the camera slowly linger in it, all the more to immerse his audience, even as the plot builds and heightens to 'action', check out "Sanjuro" directed by Akira Kurosawa, 1962.

When was the last time you left a theater from a sci-fi movie really thinking. Well in my case, it was Neill Blomkamp previous masterpiece; "DISTRICT 9". Elysium is not for everybody. The strong social / apartheid critic on District 9; is magnified here ten times more. Those looking for brainless and empty action packed entertainment might be disappointed. The violence level is really high and almost non-stop; however there are no super-heroes here. Damon's character, gets beaten a lot and humor is almost absent; just because the reality been depicted here has nothing to laugh at.In LA 2154, an small percent of the population lives in a space station called Elysium where technology and cleanness let people live for a long time and illness are easily cured.While overpopulated Earth has become a factory field where poor people lives in unhealthy condition working as slaves and controlled by very fascist robot-policemenMax (Damon) plays a petty thief who in work accident gets contaminated (he is forced by a supervisor to enter in a dangerous place ) and will die in 5 days. His only option, try to reach Elysium and get cured; but that is not easy. Jodie Foster is Secretary Delancourt; the security chief of Elysium. She is not really kind with illegal immigration ("we must defend the house we built for our sons "; she states in one moment; forgetting they live in paradise thanks to the hell people in Earth are suffering).In order to get the resources to reach Elysium, Max must first steal secrets for an Earth gangster; but those secrets are really important for Mrs. Delancourt so she hires Kruger; an assassin / mercenary the kind government officials use and then discard. Things get pretty ugly. Everything that happens is a reference to social issues; not only in America but in other countries. A couple of Cuban friends; immediately cataloged the movie as "SOCIALIST" or "LEFT"; nothing far from the truth. The movie is only concern about the abuse that governments and governments officials do against common people.It is great movie; put your brain to work and see it immediately

I saw Elysium in IMAX, so my review is only for that format.In a future where Earth is like the slums of Mexico City, the richest few have escaped to live on a satellite world. Our protagonist, played by Matt Damon is just another nobody in the overpopulated Los Angeles of 2154. The story is about his character trying to get to Elysium against seemingly impossible odds.Elysium is cut from the same cloth as District 9 (also directed by Neill Blomkomp). Both of them owe their gritty, industrial tone to Blade Runner.The idyllic world of Elysium is visually wonderful. I wish more of the action was set on that world. Perhaps viewers in 1939 felt the same way about the world of Oz, feeling that the bare glimpses of the Emerald City did not satisfy.The primary antagonist to Damon's character is Delacourt, played by Jodie Foster. Like Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, she is "civilization's" line of defense against the enemies beyond the walls. She plays her part with an iconic stoniness that some might find annoying. I thought her acting was fine.One thing that I found distracting to the point of annoyance was the overuse of hand-held cameras. I want to be thinking about the action, not the cameras.The story itself is filled with action. That may be enough. But I wish I had cared more about the quest of our hero. Maybe I didn't because it was overshadowed by the political and social implications of the story. Not that it was preachy, but distracting. Imagine The Wrath of Khan if Captain Kirk were just one of a population of millions, not an individual who is a genius warrior with an unbending will.

In the year 2154 two classes of people exist: the very wealthy WHITE PEOPLE who live on a pristine man-made space station called Elysium, and the HISPANICS (except for Matt Damon), who live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. Secretary Rhodes, an evil WHITE lady, will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve the luxurious lifestyle of the WHITE people of Elysium. That doesn't stop the HISPANIC people of Earth from trying to get in, by any means they can. When unlucky Max (The only non-evil WHITE person on earth) is backed into a corner, he agrees to take on a daunting mission that if successful will not only save his life, but could bring equality to these propagandized worlds.

i just saw pacific rim right before this and was incredibly disappointed - since elysium was getting similar ratings, i wasn't expecting much. i was very pleasantly surprised. The acting was great (whereas i think pacific rim could have saved itself if the acting had been better, MUCH better); it was visually impressive while not being too cgi/big box office-y. and i'm good with big box office/cgi filled films (think iron man) if the acting/story is there, unfortunately it wasn't there for pacific rim - surprising considering they had a great cast. overall, where pacific rim came off phony - as if everyone was trying too hard to make it work, elysium just worked. i gave pacific rim a 5 - the worst rating i have given anything since the sad little movie with the hot man, Conan ;)

Directed and written by Neil Blomkamp, the guy who is behind one of the greatest sci-fi and alien film of the past decade, District 9 (D9). This was my most anticipated movie of the summer, and surely I'm not disappointed by it.The core of the story is health care and how awful the situation is in 2154. I love the fact Blomkamp puts a message in his films while he entertains you, he doesn't try to create a change or make a direction for a change, but he brings awareness to these social issues and problems and shows how unpleasant and horrifying it can get. This helps to realism of the film's tone, which brings me to the next point I love about his films, the sci-fi aspects; it looks and feels real and believable, he doesn't make cartoonish environment, the science and technology are not too far from the realistic world. It also comes from using less green screens and performing actual stunts, but another plus in his films are the visual effects, it is astonishing, especially in some of the fight scenes, it looks so sharp and awesome. So besides the solid story, the pacing is well done, it doesn't slow down at all, the movie just keeps moving and building up without wasting a second – I totally didn't realize how fast the 100 minutes went by. The soundtrack is also perfect for this film, either if it's an emotional moment or a fight sequence, the score is there to support and add an extra element to it; Blomkamp definitely knows whom to hire to score his films, well done sir. Regarding the performances, Matt Damon surprisingly is his first sci-fi action, he brings a solid performance (I guess Dogma can be counted as sci-fi, but it wasn't as big as this, and he's done a great job here); Jodie Foster, first I need to mention that she has a really sexy, dynamic ass that I had never realized (maybe because of the Imax screens, but she surely looks sexy here), and she does a fine job here, however some might find her accent and dialogue strange and not like it, same with William Fichtner (one of the most underrated actors of the present time), but keep in mind this strange futuristic dialogue is there to show the difference between the poor class and the rich class; the best performance definitely goes to Sharlto Copley, he owns every scenes he appears on the screen, to me he's even better in here than in D9 – I found it very interesting that a lot of people didn't know he's in the movie until yesterday since he was on Reddit or just someone told them after the movie. Although with all these positive sides, I have a few problems with the film, first one is the cam shakes in some of the fight scenes, to me they're very unnecessary, especially the fact movie is R rated for the violence and the language of Copley's character - maybe at some points they considered having it in PG 13, which I'm glad they didn't because it would ruin Copley's character, and then it would destroy the whole film. The other problem is Jodi Foster's character, she's supposed to be a family oriented person, but the audience won't find that in her character at all, I guess showing more of her character would slow down the movie a little bit, and they just avoided that. Also one thing you really need to consider, this is NOT an action packed movie, there are fight and action sequences, but the film is not filled with all of it, so do NOT expect and raise your expectations based on that. I also think there are two signatures to other classic sci-fi's; a bonsai tree next to Jodi Foster, Bladerunner, and the year 2154, Avatar's year.In conclusion, this is the best sci-fi of the year, indeed, it's better than Man of Steel, Pacific Rim, Ironman 3, and even Star Trek Into Darkness, and yet it's not better than D9, but it' still enjoyable and very entertaining, definitely check it out in real IMAX if you can, I give it 8.8/10.

I definitely encourage any SciFi/Action fan to go see this film. I'm not worried about breaking down the social influence aspect blablabla I got to see a SciFi movie like this because I wanna see action and crazy weapons/technology. In these regards no one has been better than Neil Bloomkamp the past few years. His CGI just looks awesome, A true feast for the eyes. Kruger (Sharlto Copley), makes this movie and deserves to be considered on the same level as Bane (Hardy), Loki (Hiddleston) and Khan (Cumberbatch) for one of the best villains in recent years. Obviously Joker (Ledger) is in a class all his own in that respect. He even had me laughing a few times 'Its just a flesh wound...BOOM' or when he blows that dude up in LA and bumps chests w/ one of his henchman...Classic!!! I go to the Movies to be entertained and I can honestly say I was engaged from start to finish. Def worth the price of admission ill prob even get the BluRay. Enjoy!!!

Writer/director Neil Blomkamp's Elysium is much like his prior feature, District 9, a message movie that takes itself too darn seriously and never has much fun.The title of the film refers to a space station orbiting Earth, called Elysium. In the future, the rich have left Earth to live on Elysium, while the rest live in poverty and squalor on Earth, that's where we find Matt Damon's Max. Max is given only five days to live, but they can miraculously cure him if he can get to Elysium, but of course the "border patrol" of Elysium don't want any illegal immigrants on their space station and will fight him at all costs. Sound heavy handed? That's because it is. The thing is, nothing is wrong with a message movie, but when the film is zero fun, that's when I have a problem with it.The thing with Elysium is that none of the characters are really that likable. There is no real sense of hope, warmth, or just the goodness of humanity. The film's just all doom and gloom while trying to hammer home Blomkamp's personal beliefs. The thing is, this could have been a five times better film had Blomkamp made the characters we're supposed to care about enjoyable to spend time with. Would it have killed for Matt Damon to of cracked a joke once in a while, or behaved in any way truly heroic? Whether anyone wants to admit it or not, this is a $100 million Summer popcorn extravaganza, and I don't wanna feel depressed when I leave a movie where I kind of just wanted entertainment with a little bit of substance, rather than substance with no entertainment.While Elysium manages to skate by with enough action and dazzling imagery to not be a complete waste of nearly two hours, if you've seen the trailers you have seen the best of what this movie has to offer.I give Elysium a 6 out of 10!

Once again Sharlto Copley steals another movie. He brings the kind of energy, intensity and focus that is totally captivating when he is on the screen. He absolutely should have been the main character in this. he would have been far more watchable than Matt Damon, who, quite honestly, is out of his depth with films like this. Jodie Foster is good as the villainess but should have had more screen time. Alice Braga is...on screen. I think that's all that can be said.Production design is excellent and the hardware is beautifully designed.The same cannot be said of the script which is underdeveloped. It feels like a first draft.Pacing is poor, some parts drag, but there are some impressive action sequences. Shaky camera work reduces their effectiveness at times but still some moments of excitement.

I've read a lot of negative stuff about Elysium in IMDb lately and I don't think it's all warranted. Certainly many of the negative points are true. There is a lack of story development/backstory for the Elysium world. I really feel the film skipped across the actual people and world of Elysium in a way that actually made it feel a bit budget. Everyone wears suits or bikinis and the lawns are perfectly manicured - apparently I'm supposed to think that this means Elysium is the perfect utopia. The shaky cam is a little distracting and frustrating at times. The story is just OK. The ending a over the top cliché. There are a bunch of plot holes. D9 is in an entirely different league in these respects and is overall a better film by some way.But what is fantastic about this is the gripping, visceral action. Sharlto Copley returns as a psychotic mercenary is an unbelievable departure from his wussy character in D9. Honestly I was amazed how effective he was as a scary bad guy given the roles I've seen him play before. The futuristic weaponry and robots is a feast for the eyes and ears. The violence is jarring, realistic and left me speechless at times. In these ways the film matched D9 and I was again impressed at what Neil Blomkamp had created on screen. Matt Damon is a great actor and was solid in this film. At the end of the day I was entertained from start to finish and had a great time watching the film. Granted, its no District 9 but it is a great film to watch anyhow. Go check it out.

The story was interesting, though I believe it is a retelling of part of HG Well's "Time Machine", with the Morlocks living underground and the Eloi living above. Very easy comparison with people living in the squall of Earth while the elite live above in the space station.I did find the contrasts interesting, with Max (Matt Damon) being very visceral with his language (both in English AND Spanish) while Ms Delacourt (Jodie Foster), playing the refined bureaucrat (fluent in French) was actually the one with the coarser disposition. There was however a scene where the violence and carnage just got to be a bit much. My wife was noticeably disturbed by it, so we chose to leave. I'm confident this film will do very well, it just wasn't my "cup of tea".

Normally I can set aside politics, otherwise, I couldn't listen to most music or see most movies. But, Elysium was a total over the top piece of liberal garbage. When, at basically the beginning of the film, they had Police Robots programmed with Police Brutality breaking a guy's arm because he swore at them, I knew I was in trouble. I almost walked out and I probably should have. The special effects and the visuals were pretty amazing. That was overshadowed by the lack of depth in the characters. Also, the overdubbing of Jodie Foster's lines was so badly out of sync the entire movie, I cringed every time she came on screen and got ready to speak.-------------------------------------------SPOILER ALERT! Do Not Read Below if you are a Self-Loather and want to see this movie!------------------------------------------- Here is an overview: Elysium = United States, Earth = The Third World, Los Angeles has been turned into a shanty town where they raise poor uneducated white kids in Catholic orphanages, Earth Police force are now robots programmed with Police Brutality to oppress 'Illegals', OSHA is gone so factory jobs are all hazardous to your health, 'Illegals' have factory jobs building the robot Police that oppress them, Evil factory owners think bed sheets are more valuable than fatally wounded workers, Rich educated Elysium people (who speak French) are hogging HealthCare, 'Illegals' on Earth (who speak Spanish) want to become 'Legal' and get Free HealthCare, 'Illegals' on Earth pay Smugglers to get Fake IDs and transport, the Evil Defense Department and Homeland Security use Evil Sadistic Lunatic Rapist Murder Military "Contractors" to blow up 'Illegals' and stick survivor 'Illegals' in cages until they can be deported, 'Illegals' overcome and get Citizenship and Free HealthCare. I think that about sums it up. Enjoy.Otto

Man., talk about immigration restrictions! In this film the wealthy society have left earth and moved into outer space to a spiraling community called Elysium. Healthcare back on earth is virtually non-existent, while on Elysium (as shown in the trailer) there is a magic healing machine that can fix any kind of ailment that you can think of. I thought during the film that if such a machine did exist, earth would explode with population growth. Maybe that will be the sequel (smile). I was also happy to see that they re-used earthly communities from District 9 (or something very similar). Why not save a buck when you can. Max (Matt Damon) finds himself in a very volatile situation and desperately needs to get to Elysium to rectify the situation. In order to get this done he has to make a "last ditch" deal with Spider (Wagner Moura) who is the local deviant. Max also bumps into his childhood friend, Frey (Alice Braga) who somehow manages to get herself entangled in this whole mess. There is also an undercover hit man running around earth named Kruger (Sharlto Copley – reappearing from District 9) who works for the corrupt Delacourt (Jodie Foster). I have to pause here and just say that I couldn't understand one thing that Kruger was saying. Anyway, Delacourt is constantly breaking the rules and is tired of taking orders from the space court. She wants to do things her way. That being said, in comes John Carlyle (William Fichtner) who is a greedy business man looking to get as many government contracts as he can. The robot army in the film kind of reminded me of I, Robot (especially at the end of the film). I think that director Neill Blomkamp is definitely comfortable in this genre and I think he should continue to make Sci-fi films, however I think that this film lacked an emotional connection for me. I really never got vested in the main character although Frey's daughter did tug at the heart strings just a bit. On a positive note, I think that parts of the film were visually stunning. It never ceases to amaze me with what they can do with CGI. I found the film to be very predictable, but I am glad that it was not butt-blister long. There are a lot of films opening this weekend and I am not sure that I would put this one at the top of the list. I give this film an amber light.

I am a Bourne trilogy fan, and enjoy watching Matt Damon, but this movie had stale conversations didn't really bring the act to this. The action was decent though, the stand offs were very entertaining and overall it was a good movie. Except for one major part, the story comes out as him trying to save himself, then turns to saving the entire planet, and then him saving his girlfriends daughter. Even there is the problem the characters were not developed, the viewer seems random flashbacks of his life one I think was around 3 times. Never though do they explain the story of him and his girlfriend and where does she get the baby from. Away from children, and back to reality another drawback of the movie is it's politics system. Seems as though Mexico took over USA in 130 years because everyone speaks Spanish, and all the French people took all the rich people and flew out in space. Lastly, are the effects, some were cheap (first crash landing) and some were awesome (elysium itself and the gruesome splatter effects). There were neat ideas put into the movie of how it is going to be in 130 years. The scene with the parole officer was amusing. Also, I gotta admit the shield that the bad guy was using was wicked, and the whole reconstruction/healing was neat or at least as long as your brain works (go see the movie you know what I am talking about)This is my first review, thought I will try to write and maybe was a bit harsh with my rating, but I think the idea has potential, but should have been worked on a little more. Oh, my girlfriend thought that the awfully accented bad guy was Chuck Norris.

Remake, redone it, and same 'ol same 'ol. Get my drift? Lots of Hollywood feeding us what they think we will by but, it just ain't so. Visually a stunning FX movie. Lots of C.G. and "Big Bucks" effects. This story has been done so many times before. Corruption of power and the old "Haves & Havenots" are the themes seen here. Matt does a stellar job delivering his character throughout this so-so film but as for Jodie I'm gonna tell it like it is. Jodie "over-acts" the character and makes me wonder how casting decided on her to be a villain. When will Hollywood come to the realization that copycat films become just another remake film? I was impressed with the filming and camera work.

This movie was a blast. I went with five people, and every single one loved it. So did most of the audience judging by their mood and comments exiting the theater.The only people who don't like this film are right wing crazies who don't like anything that might draw attention to thew perverse wealth disparity between a few thousand super rich people and everyone else.While I don't consider this to be a political film, it does depict a projection of our current situation where one small elite class lives in a completely different world then the rest of us. If that bothers you, then please, don't see this film.But if you like solid entertainment, an excellent and moving story, and amazing special effects and visuals, you can't do better.

Elysium, this summer's most awaited sci-fi flick proves to be a winner. Compared to District 9, this film focuses mildly less on story telling and more on it's action scenes which are high octane and will grab your attention simply with it's cinematographic appearance. Matt Damon shows that he has the chops to have a dramatic presence while containing all the proper traits of an action star, being likable but serious at the same time. The plot is less original and more simple than District 9 but there is still a fun experience to be had. Sharlto Copley represents his versatility by being a serious character in D9, a zany/charismatic one in the A-Team, and now a gruesome villain here. This futuristic story allows much ridiculousness and trust me there are many far fetched instances which it uses to it's advantages. Your eyes will be put in a trance with The film's "iconic" special effects and with a solid script blending with climactic action, this has a formula for a huge summer blockbuster. Now at times this film may fall victim to style over substance but never long enough to wreck the experience and it can be enjoyable dumb fun. There is an under-dog tone to this flick as well with Earth being under Elysium, this adds intensity and much more emotion which will easily give thrills. It's extremely fresh to see that whenever the film shows it's comedic side, there are no cheap laughs but it rarely is comical, it's pure action and far more brutal you would think. Neill Blomkamp reassures the public that he is a sci-fi force to be reckoned with.

This movie could not have contained more clichés. There were science fiction clichés, adventure movie clichés and mechanized battle clichés. This was a long string of scenes from other movies and TV shows strung together but without any real purpose.The script and directing lacked any semblance of quality. There was no meaningful plot or dialog. To compensate for this, loud and pounding music was used to try to convey to the audience when they were seeing suspenseful or dangerous scenes.If the script and directing we're awful the performances of Matt Damon and Jodie Foster were worse. They were both wooden. Matt Damon at times showed a tendency to reprise his Bourne performances and at other times was just pitiful. Jody Foster was totally uninspired and without life. They both seemed to be bored with the movie and I certainly was. Don't waist you time. This movie isn't worth it. Go see something else.

Enjoyable film. Many moments where you just have to check your brain to make sure that you forgive the plot holes. Damon is great. Kruger is positively unintelligible. Do not understand how some equate this with good acting. I found him very irritating, but not in a good actor way.The contrast between earth and Elysium is stark but for God's sake, why do directors and cinematographers seem to think that shaky cam = the gritty reality of the main character's angst-y situation? LET THE ACTORS ACT IT! While I held it together this time, the film would be best served with a Dramamine for every moment they're on earth or in a fight scene. I would definitely have ranked it higher if they could have located a freaking tripod on set.

If you enjoy Blomkamp's sci fi visual eye candy from his other movies and short films, then this film will not disappoint. I would not recommend the Imax experience for this one since the shaky cam is overwhelming in that setting (and i usually don't complain about shaky cam). The story is highly political involving themes of healthcare, immigration, and homeland security with a slant favoring liberalism. LA now looks like a third world slum with gang graffiti in every nook and cranny. Also, the Jason Bourne comes out of Matt Damon in the fight scenes which is always fun to watch. Doesn't have the same emotional punch as District 9, but a decent addition to the genre. 7/10 is what I would rate it personally. The visual effects alone are worth the price of admission on this one.

I can already see reactions to Elysium breaking down along predictable lines. Movie reviewers who don't like sci-fi anyway are calling it the worst movie of the year, and so on.Well, here is my measured defense of Elysium. I certainly don't think it's the best movie of the year. Far from it. It was at times marred by what I think was too much gore, when it could have been deeper, more meaningfully dramatic violence. The dialogue was too hard to understand at key moments. I don't think it will have mass appeal, although by good word of mouth it could still get a decent box office draw. If it had had some of the improvements that someone like Ridley Scott might have given it, it would have been closer to a latter-day Blade Runner, and a top movie of the year all around.However, what I very much liked about this film is that it led with its idea, and the idea is a very valuable one for modern moviegoers.In a world increasingly filled with films that try to be too clever by half, Elysium has a somewhat clumsy delivery but a powerful message. It seems hokey at first only in the way that seeing the way the founding fathers dressed and spoke seems a little hokey when you visit Washington DC. But when you probe a little further, you see that the story of Max Da Costa is one that is already here in a lot of ways. The illegal immigration struggle, the prison complex, the government both corrupt and seemingly impervious to the old-time checks and balances. Sure, the ending has to be tidy for this action movie to work, but for people who are willing to watch it with an open mind, it has a lot to say. And I'm sure you can spare two hours for it if you're only going to watch the Kardashians or Real Housewives or UFC anyway that night. Ask yourself honestly if the world of Elysium is different in kind, or only in degree.

Elysium is the logical conclusion of a Survival-of-the-Fittest philosophy currently espoused by many Republicans, Tea Party fanatics and the apolitical, super rich. Greed and selfishness is the Law-of-the-Land in Elysium! Don't bother healing the critically ill on Earth with amazing life saving technology. If the sick are not one of the rich and powerful living aboard the giant ocean-liner-in-space then let 'em drop dead in the streets! This is a place where Ayn Rand would be King! Elysium is the ultimate gated community! A wet dream for any rich and powerful person who sees the rest of us as a threat. The corporations and their lackeys in government, the courts and the press literally turn the earth into one giant cesspool and then they get to escape to a corporate utopia in outer space! All I can say is: God help us all! Films like like Elysium are a wake-up call to help prevent what might actually happens someday if the course the vast majority of the world is on is not changed!

A lot of reviewers complain that this movie's message is heavy-handed. Yet they still miss the message. The message of this movie is more about the plight of illegal aliens. The security agency on Elysium is even called Homeland Security. You have poor people desperately trying to sneak into Elysium with fake citizenship. The message of the movie is that we living in American and Europe live in Elysium and we don't give a damn about the people starving and dying in the third world. We're more concerned with keeping them out.That's the message and it comes in an amazingly well done sci-fi action movie package. No one can claim that this movie is preachy because IT's AN ACTION MOVIE. The action pacing is non-stop. It has no pauses or lulls. It's extremely difficult to make a movie that is so well paced. Oh, and it has so man bad-ass moments. Imagine Total Recall (original one) but with better action, a better story and a great human message. That's Elysium.

I should have avoided seeing this film opening weekend; a lesson I normally adhere to. Very disappointing.The story is pretty good and could/should have made for a very good sci-fi/action flick. The biggest drawback by far is the frenetic, confusing, shaky shooting and editing. This is something we've been seeing more of in the last several years for reasons unknown. The closest thing I've ever heard to a compliment on this style has been - "It doesn't really bother me." What I do hear often and personally agree with is "It sucks. I can't tell what the hell's going on!", with a close second being "It's making me feel sick to my stomach." No one has ever watched a "traditionally" filmed scene and said "Wow, that was terrible, I could actually see everything that was happening and know exactly what was going on." This new trend is just lazy and sloppy. The other notable distraction was Jodie Foster who is normally very solid and put in what I think is the worst performance of her career. It's not that the dialogue was bad, but her presentation was hideous. Trying to put on an air of aristocracy, her pronunciation was painful to watch and completely unbelievable.

This movie is not a completely successful one on an artistic level. Imaginative, well-produced, gorgeous art direction, costumes, settings, but it fails on some key levels for me in terms of story. However, the real test of a good movie is the suspension of disbelief and the degree to which you are entertained. In this sense, the movie may ultimately fail but it goes down swinging.Matt Damon's character never truly comes to life for me. He has been excellent in other action pieces, the Bourne Identity movies come to mind. But here he has almost nothing to play with. Flashbacks of his childhood with a young girl from the orphanage run throughout the movie to give us an emotional connection that just doesn't work. Still, Damon is nothing if not talented and he tries to deliver.Arguably the brightest element of the movie is Jodie Foster, who plays a futuristic version of Christine Lagarde, only prettier and sexier, who holds the position of Defense Minister of Elysium. She gives a coolly elegant portrayal in her sumptuous, tight dress suits and cutting edge hairstyle. When she's not on screen the movie loses some of its spark.An interesting note about future class distinctions; Earth is, of course, where all the poor people live; it is multi-cultural with an interesting mixture of Spanish speaking and English speaking population groups. Elysium is where the plutocracy lives. It, too, is multicultural in the sense that you have a diversity of colors, and both women and men in positions of influence, but it seems to be characterized by people who come from a French and English speaking background. In Elysium there are moments when people speak exclusively in French (with English subtitles), just like on Earth there are moments where people speak exclusively in Spanish (including Matt Damon's character). This is an interesting take on future class distinctions and it happens so frequently throughout the film that it is clearly intentional, and thought-provoking. It's as if the American East Coast elite and the British City of London financial power-players joined forces in a plutocratic melting pot with the Grande Ecole upper echelon officials and chief executives of the French Republic.Worth seeing, but catch a matinée.

I saw "Elysium", starring Matt Damon-The Bourne movies, Chasing Amy; Jodie Foster-Panic Room, Taxi Driver; Sharlto Copley-The A Team-2010, District 9 and Alice Braga-Predators, I Am Legend.This is a sci-fi action movie that is directed by Neill Blomkamp, whose first movie was 'District 9'-this is his second film. It takes place in the year 2154, where Earth is over populated and diseased, at least 99% of the population, anyway. The 1%, who just happen to be rich, live on an orbiting space station called Elysium, where diseases can be cured instantly and they live in mansions. Jodie is the Defense Secretary of Elysium, second in control after the President. Matt, who lives on Earth with all the other poor people who can't afford good health insurance-Hey, that sounds like it could be straight out of the headlines of what is going on right now-gets hurt on his job and only has five days to live. His only chance is to get up to Elysium and get a cure but Jodie has a habit of shooting down any unauthorized ships-she doesn't seem to like the poor illegals that are only trying to get their share of the pie. Alice is a childhood girlfriend of Matt's that also has a reason to get to Elysium and Sharlto plays an off the books enforcer for Jodie; you know, doing all the dirty clean up jobs that Jodie doesn't want the President to find out about. It's rated "R" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. I did not like the ending, but I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.

This movie is very successful on one level, a flop on another. As a high octane, action based sci-fi thriller, it is great. The visuals and special effects are some of the best I have ever seen, it is well acted, and has tons of heart-stopping action sequences. Its downfall is that it takes itself too seriously, and tries make a social statement. The parallels between the inhabitants of a future destitute LA (mostly Chicano) trying to gain citizenship in the prosperous (mostly white) world of Elysium, are so obvious they are laughable. Its like something you would expect a high school student to come up with if they were given an assignment to write a story outlining the evils of our society. Very superficial and shallow. I wont give spoilers, but I don't really have to - you know how it is going to end after about the first 30 minutes.On the other hand, even though I knew what the eventual outcome would be, I didn't know how we would get there, and the ride along the way is a lot of fun. I was thoroughly entertained for 2 hours, was never once bored, and was often on the edge of my seat. And who says every movie has to have a "message"? If you are looking for something deep that makes you think about social issues in another way, save your money. If you are looking for two hours of solid escapist fun and entertainment, I highly recommend it.

Where do I even begin, this movie was awful, I spent an Hour and fifty minutes, Getting a lecture that "Rich White People" are evil bigots, to anyone who has a Different Skin color and Apparnelty Matt Damon is the Last White person on earth that can do anything, The film takes cheap shots on the Politics of The Haves and Haves Not and Heath Care. The Other problem is it does so in a very Rude and not fair manner. All the Junkets for this film everyone says it had no political agenda, Bullshit, it a waking Political agenda Portraying Earth (aka Mexico, 3rd World country) to Elysium (Aka America, 1%) at every turn, I thought they would be more to it that just wealth and heath inequality, Boy was I wrong, Don't see this film.

As Sci Fi fans we looked forward to the premiere of Elysium. It was awful. it was a pathetic and expensive attempt by Blomkamp to stuff his values and political agenda down our throat. Elysium succeeded in eclipsing the performance of Matt Damon and Jodi Foster with loud noises, expensive special effects and bad science. ( Our I-Max theater was extremely loud, we spoke to management about it, "Sorry it is an I-Max film, we can't change the volume setting') A human punching a well armored Robot ? (Come on!) hand grenade goes off in the passenger compartment of a space ship and only one person is hurt, crash landing a space ship onto the Elysium space station and people survive a crash that tears up 200 yards of space station (give me a break); space craft go to full forward thrust to land?? A lot of bad science. and poorly executed Special effects. Wait for the video.

The film was generally fantastic and intriguing with an original plot and adequate acting. If you're interested in more information on these aspects of the film, I recommend reading the other reviews. This review will be addressing some of the underlying concepts and implications I noticed:Early into the film, I noticed multiple implications within the film that could easily be interpreted as controversial. For example, there seemed to have been some potentially race-based implications within the film. Although this may simply be due to the fact that the setting on Earth was Los Angeles, CA, the vast majority of people represented as living in poverty on Earth were of Hispanic or Latino origin. Moreover, those living on Elysium and the rich on Earth were almost exclusively white or Caucasian. While I do not say this is necessarily inaccurate or problematic, this could definitely be considered offensive to some or racially-suggestive to those who focus on or discriminate against race and/or ethnicity.Secondly and along this line of thought, I noticed how the majority of people on Earth were, like I said, of Hispanic or Latino origin. I am curious as to what the director and writers intended with this. Some people may find this to be suggestive of immigration problems, or that the writers meant to portray how ethnic and racial demographics may be if the estimates about ethnic-based population statistics are true.Whether the director and writers meant to be as accurate as they can be with their portrayal of an impoverished, futuristic Earth, or if they intended to make this film politically charged, I cannot say. I can say, however, that this film was interesting and that there are undoubtedly some politically controversial issues implied within the movie.Overall, I loved the film and would watch it again if it came on television. The graphics were great and the plot was amazing. If you want to watch an awesome movie, watch Elysium.

Can't tell you how great it is to see someone capable of filling Ridley Scott's and James Cameron's shoes! Blomkamp has made the best movie yet this year. I was intrigued by District 9. It made me think, but this self-assured and skillfully crafted effort is taking his game to a much higher level.It's been a long time since I was in awe of both the script and the direction. To see they both came from one guy, Neill Blomkamp, is wonderful if a little unnerving. Do we really have to rely on foreigners for biting social commentary?This film is much more clever than most reviewers are letting on. One reviewer said it's a bit melodramatic, but, frankly, I don't see a subtle treatment getting to first base with most Americans. This puts a lot of troubling issues in sharp relief in an artful, very watchable format whereas most of the arguments about immigration, healthcare and the rich versus the poor are in dense, boring prose.I was warned that Jodie Foster's performance was marred by odd accents, but I barely noticed. I thought she depicted a kind of sharp edged conservative that should be readily recognizable. Sharlto Copley is great as a vicious soldier and Matt Damon is the likable center of the film, as called for. The supporting actors including Braga, Luna and Fichtner, to name a few, all add much to the whole enterprise.This is definitely a go see and I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to anyone, including pre-teens and up.

"District 9″ was one of the most ambitious and dare I say most creative films in recent memory. The film's director, Neil Blomkamp showcased his directorial talent not only with the stylistic aspects of the film, but with the overall pacing and story. With that in mind, I would be lying if I were to say that the film did not have it's fair share of problems. "District 9″ was laced with inconsistencies and plot holes, but it's gripping story and meticulous attention to the production design forced me to ignore these nitpicks. Blomkamp's newest film "Elysium" is yet another sci-fi thriller. It stars Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley and is set in the distant-ish future. Basically, earth has become a poverty stricken, overpopulated wasteland due to mass amounts of pollution. The upper echelon of society has built a large space station in which the wealthy population can live. The space station is known as "Elysium", any virus disease or injury can be cured there with the help of the station's state of the art medical technology. Elysium's tight security is helmed by Secretary Delacourt, played by Jodie Foster who has a crazed thirst for power. The story mainly revolves around the character of Max, played by Matt Damon. Max is an engineer working at a large factory, building droids. After serving his time in prison for various crimes, Max has decided to turn his life around. Unfortunately, after a fatal accident at the factory, Max is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation and has only got five days left to live. His only hope is to get to Elysium and cure his disease. To infiltrate the stations wide array of security, Max is forced to risk his own life.This is a pretty over the top film, especially Jodie Foster's performance. Foster plays the cliché sophisticated villain that is always bearing a snobbish grin. She speaks in a very strange accent that is sort of a mix between British and..middle eastern or south African and to top it off, she exaggerates all of her lines to the point of laughter. Not a good performance on the part of Foster. Matt Damon gives an alright performance, I would have liked for his character to have more depth and development. Otherwise, he was alright. On an entertainment level, Sharlto Copley shines bright, his character, although over the top provides for some great entertainment. He is both psychotic and likable. The production design is just wow, it is beautiful. Neil Blomkamp seems to love to indulge in the look of his films. In the case of "Elysium" we see two different worlds, both equally impressive. We see the sleek and sterile Elysium and the ruined, dingy Earth. It is fair to say that the stylistic aspects of the film are a win on behalf of Neil Blomkamp. Like "District 9″, "Elysium" has a fair amount of political and social commentaries. This time regarding healthcare and immigration. I'm not going to go into great depths in regard to the film's underlying themes, because i'm just not up for it.Here is a film that is incredibly over the top and at times ludicrous, even for a science fiction film, but it still holds up as an entertaining watch. It relies on it's stunning production design and overall style as well as the well played out action sequences. Jodie Foster did not live up to the expectations set by her previous films and at times was even laughable. Matt Damon delivered an alright performance and Sharlto Copley was as entertaining as ever. "Elysium" is no "District 9″, but it still holds it's own in the large spectrum of science fiction cinema.

If I were to stereotype today's leftist liberal thinking, I couldn't do better than this movie: Wealthy whites (bad; wealthy whites are always bad, except when they vote for Obama) deserted earth (white flight; isn't that what bad rich whites always do?) to live on a space station called Elysium (white suburb or gated community), and the hispanics (except for white hero Matt Damon), get to live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. Secretary Rhodes, an evil white lady (why must the evil ones always be white?), will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve, protect and defend the white people of Elysium. That doesn't stop the hispanic (code for good but exploited) people of Earth from trying to get in, by any means they can. When unlucky Max (the token non-evil white person on earth) takes on the task ( like good white man Tarzan) of saving the good (non-white) people of earth. _________________________ It's a testament to the stupidity of the average moviegoer that so many have bought this simplistic BS. Here on the real earth, I wonder when Matt Damon is going to move his whole family out of his Elysium and into Detroit.

Without a doubt Elysium is the best sci-fi movie this summer (yet). It also works well as an action movie. Imaginative action scenes are partly quite brutal but it just emphasizes movies dystopia. Beautiful Elysium is pleasant to watch and it highlights it's difference to slummy Los Angeles. Gap between privileged citizens of Elysium and poor people of earth is breathtaking to watch. Clever social criticism is narrated very strongly and evocative story works beautifully together. With it length of less than two hours the story works great. Movie doesn't stop until the story is told. It would be perfect movie if action scenes were filmed with still cameras. Manual shooting is partly quite hard to follow. Matt Damon is great at Max but Jodie Fosters Delacourt stays little lame. Elysium is imperative to see for everyone who loves clever sci-fi movie. I will wait with great interest Neil Blomkamps next movie. Great summer entertainment.

Elysium is a Kubrick/Clarke-like 2001 spoked wheel hovering and tormenting the L.A. underclass still suffering in the environmentally-challenged earth of 2054. Writer-director Neill Blompkamp has another gritty, chaotic future like his acclaimed District 9, only this time he hews closer to traditional sci-fi with bald political parallels to 2013 and pervasive fighting to the exclusion of the more cerebral possibilities of the intriguing premise. Put simply, the have's are flying high while the have not's are miserable in an underworld recalling the workers in Fritz Lang's Metropolis."Cerebral" is how I would characterize Kubrick's sci-fi; "visceral" is what I see in Blomkamp's. Like our dreams of paradise, that place must be better. In Elysium it is manifestly so: The rich have set up a gated community in the sky where all their needs are taken care of, especially medical because they can be cured immediately by their individual health-care machines and virtually live forever—not available on earth. The didactic implications of stern immigration laws on Elysium coupled with a lack of universal health care on earth provides Elysium with enough allegorical ammunition to keep three of these movies going. Alas, violence dominates as it usually does in contemporary sci-fi.Those allegorical implications are almost heavy-handed: Earth is over-populated, minorities are now the majority, and the rich have become so rich they can abandon earth and live isolated from the woes of working people and an over-burdened planet. Enter hero Max (post-apocalyptic Mad Max?), played by the durable and always intelligent Matt Damon, a good-hearted ex-thief on the right path, who needs to get to Elysium to stop his imminent death from radiation. Saddled with a desire to help the ailing daughter of a life-long friend, Frey (Alice Braga), Max has a reason to subvert the ruling class on Elysium and enfranchise him and the rest of the abandoned earth.The premise is 2001-worthy, but the execution is dominated by the old chase motif with accompanying fisticuffs that last forever. Why not, like 2001, have a few fighting apes and then an ominous monolith or two? Suspense and satisfaction don't need to rely on violence. Nor does Jodie Foster as defense secretary Delacourt need to rely on a French accent so flawed as to be distracting from her thespian excellence (remember agent Starling?)While hand-to-hand combat still seems absurd in a world where a scanning machine can cure you of what ails, even death, Blomkamp falls in to the modern CGI obsessions related to combat rather than wit. Still, this is August, and an intelligent actioner with figurative possibilities is a minor gift. I'll take it and dream of an Elysium where Oscar-worthy films appear each month, not just in December.

Elysium, a film that I was not at all excited for, but still saw it. Blomkamp is back after the success of one of the best sci-fi films in along time, D9.So, visually the film is incredible and that's what I think is the films strongest aspect. The vast landscapes of this poverty filled Earth is beautiful, yet so dirty. You can actually believe this is Earth because with a lot of neglect over time, Earth may or may not turn out that way. And then there's Elysium, that I find to be an extremely cheesy Utopian world. I was chuckling every time there were shots of that world and the people in it. Everything too perfect. Yes, I know that's the point, but I just think the way it's executed is really cheesy. The visual effects are perfect and blended extremely well. The CGI looks as real as you can possibly get with CGI. There wasn't a moment when I was questioning whether it's CGI or not. I honestly thought it was all real. The robots are so fascinating because of their colors. The robots are bright colors like red, yellow, orange, which is a contrast to what Earth is. The set and production designers are top of their game with Elysium. My biggest problem with the direction of this film is the shaky-cam. I'm usually a fan of the shaky-cam because it can add a grittiness to the film and most of the times it does in the film, except for the action scenes. Almost every action scene has so much shakiness you get disoriented to what actually going and which character is where. I would have loved smoother and more clarity to the action scene because I want to see what's going and what fight technique each character has. And having a ton of cuts during the fight scene doesn't help either. It's like one shaky tight shot, cut to another and another, then to a medium, then to a wide and back to a million more close ups. Thus being said, that didn't stop me from getting into most of the fight scenes. My favorite fight scene is probably the first one once Max is attached to the exoskeleton machine because you get introduced to the weapons and the strength this machine brings to Max. My least favorite is the final fight scene between Max and Kruger because the way it's shot makes me so disoriented and seems really rushed to get over with. Also, I love the gore. Get ready for some imploding and exploding humans. The script is by far the weakest aspect of the film and it really turns me off big time. The film starts out pretty good with comparing the situations on Earth and on Elysium to show the social and economic inequality. But we kind of lose all that once the action starts. These issues just back into a corner and stay hidden, so it just turns into the "good guys" vs the "bad guys." And that's it. Of course you know the character's motives and what not, but I still just found that way over powered by one dimensional characters. There's hardly any character development for except for Max and Frey, which told through flashback, which I fairly enjoyed, but nothing new to storytelling. Finding out about Max's and Frey's relationship/friendship in the past still doesn't get me emotionally attached to the two character. Their relationship and motives seem way too mechanical. No other character has any character development. I think it's really comical that basically everyone on Elysium are rich white people, which are portrayed as evil bigots and then Earth is only filled with people of different race and Matt Damon is apparently the last white person on Earth. The film also takes cheap shots at health-care. Elysium just rudely slaps you in the face with a political agenda about inequality of wealth, health-care, and race. The whole film is also carried by really cheesy dialogue that is quite laughable at times. I'm just going to start out by saying that I think Jodie Foster is comically dreadful. I remember when she is first on screen and delivers her lines, my girlfriend and I look at each other with confused looks. Foster is way too over dramatic with the way she delivers her lines and facial expressions. She literally pauses after every other word. And what kind of accent or should I ask accents is she speaking with? Her movements are stiff and robotic like. Foster is a bad actress by any means, but holy sh*t, she's unwatchable in this. Matt Damon is decent in the film. He does what he's hired to do and shows some emotion, which is nice, but nothing special. I don't have anything to say about Alice Braga besides, bland. Now, Sharlto Copley has by far the best performance out of everyone, but I still don't like him in the film. Copley disappears into his one dimensional character. His performance is very much a caricature, but that voice, that voice! My best, yet poorly way to describe his voice in the film is like a high pitched Australian Grouch from Sesame Street. I was annoyed from beginning to end. I almost forgot, Diego Luna is my favorite part of the whole film and he only has like 15 minutes of screen time. I think he has the best performance and most likable character. He connection emotionally with me without any character development, weird. Maybe I'm in love with the actor. I saw Elysium with three other people and we all left the theater joking about how bad it is. At least we got $10 worth of laughs out Elysium, right?

What seems to be a trend in big budget SF films occurred, once again, in Elysium. I'm continually impressed with what is being created (visual effects wise)today, but remain disappointed when it comes to the associated screenplays/plot lines. At the end of this film, I had the same, perpetual feeling that no one out there making SF films gets the message: without a good story, you don't have a really good film. Elysium hearkens me back to Prometheus, directed by Ridley Scott. I would have thought he, at least, would appreciate the need for a good story to match the visuals. Especially after being the brains behind Bladerunner. But, oh no - same thing. I suspect that so much talent and expense is spent on the visuals that insufficient amounts of funding and time are left for the associated story.I just wish that, when someone comes up with future plans for making a legitimate SF film (sans comic book scenarios), they contract a real science fiction author to write the screenplay. There are any number of SF writers out there that can, I believe, turn out much better scripts than currently making their way to the big screen.Bottom line: the world building in Elysium was excellent. Probably some of the best since Avatar. I wish there had been some of this when Bladerunner was produced. As an avid, and long time fan of true science fiction, I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the film. As for the story, it could have been a lot, lot better.

The first thing that struck me about this movie, and continued to strike me throughout, was how damn good it looks. It takes the slums as seen in District 9 and makes them much, much cooler - then contrasts them with the immaculate perfection of Elysium. The other components were admittedly not as good, but it still stood up. The characters are strong, if not particularly vivid (except for Kruger, who steals the show as the villain). The story is strong, though it moves slowly at times. Ultimately the film has a nice dark message, but it feels a bit to force-down-our-throats to add to the film, in fact it takes away a bit from the rest. I would certainly recommend this picture, but it was by no means perfect.

I apologize for the delay on this, I watched this film Thursday night and it took me this long to settle on what I needed to say about it. If you are worried about the girl who won't shut up about movies having to figure out what to say about this one; you should be. This is Writer and Director Neil Blomkamps sophomore effort in the US. Most people remember the Peter Jackson produced (that means he was the money) District 9. A not so subtle story about the effects of racism in his native country of South Africa using aliens and humans as the opposing races. While many Americans that I know of derided the movie for it's obvious themes and what appeared to be a "why now?" mindset. What those individuals forget is that while the laws against segregation were enacted within the US in 1964 it wasn't for another 30 years until they were put into place in his country until 1994. Thats right, everyone reading this review was alive then. It was only 19 years ago (15 when District 9 came out); so it was fresh in his memory and his countries memory not something told in history books and hundreds of movies since.This may seem like a long diatribe on history and this director without point, but I swear I have one. It's that he has gone back to what the best of Science Fiction used to do; which is focus on social or current issues framing it in an alternate world that provokes thought and with a bit of luck awareness. So while films like District 9 and comics like X- men (originally) focused on racism, Elysium and other films in the sci fi and horror genre are beginning to focus on a new *ism*, class-ism. But do they do it well?That's the question that kept me silent and wondering on this one. The answer I am afraid is *No*. While Elysium sets up a dystopian future with clear lines between the haves and the have nots, it doesn't really do anything with it in a meaningful way. No one learns anything, no one evolves. While the plot lines introduced in the movie are resolved in a nice tidy bow, the only lessons the film teaches us:If you are amoral - you will die If you are a have not - you will suffer first, then die. The only way the Have Nots can achieve what the Haves have (sounds weird), is through violence, treachery and few Haves wanting more and making a well timed mistake.From a storytelling perspective, the movie does nothing new. If you saw the recent Total Recall remake (it is not as bad as people say), you have watched Elysium. DOn't believe me? While I normally remain spoiler free I feel that I must provide some synopsis that may contain spoilers.Try this: A blue collar man who works on the robotic line that makes the robot police that keep him and the rest of the low class oppressed rises up and through violence and criminal amoral acts with the inspirational help a woman who loves him and reaches the other side of the world, while being hunted by a terminator esque force, where the Rich live and brings down the threat of oppression allowing his people, the poor working class to be free and live happily.Another one? JOhnny Mnemonic. Don't boo, it has nostalgia value and is highly entertaining in the cyberpunk genre. A man with a dubious and somewhat criminal history has data that can save the world implanted in his head. Rather than wanting to save the world, he wants nothing but to save himself. The people who like the world just the way it is dispatch a terminator esque creature to stop him from reaching a resistance that he is being guided to by a woman who cares for him. In the end to save his own life and those of the people around him he goes for broke and manages to use whats in his head to save the underclass citizens of the world.Both of these synopsis just describe Elysium. WHile there are different effects, different characters, filming styles, etc Elysium adds nothing truly new other than a medical McGuffin that everyone wants. The acting is fine, the actors themselves are fine even if they are playing two dimensional stereotypes we have seen before.STOP. WITH. THE. SHAKY. CAM.I wanted to watch the fights and I couldn't because the camera man was clearly involved in a 7.0 earthquake at the time of filming. I want to hunt the inventor of shaky cam to the ends of the earth for it.TL;DRWHile Elysium isn't bad, I wasn't really entertained except for a few moments of the film. Matt Damon and Sharlto COpley are all that save this from being a bad movie.Matinée it if you must, skip it entirely if you musn't.This movie doesn't have a chance of overriding the system.

1 means awful. I wouldn't use awful for this movie. I would say it should have never been conceived. This movie should have been aborted. Nothing about this movie is original. It borrows from most half-decent sci-fi flicks and makes it worse. I mean was this supposed to be a parody? What was the director trying to accomplish? Seriously, Jet Li's "The One" is a much better movie than this. I cannot believe that this steaming pile of trash has passed for a movie. Well, maybe I can since Sony has shoved this steaming pile of rotting cabbage in my face every other commercial. People probably only saw this movie because it was shoved in their face and felt a need to see it. This movie is for the intellectually challenged. Those who like it have the mental capacity of a rusty nail.

They did a fantastic job on effects, particularly the rebuilding of a face, and bodies breaking apart. The characters and storyline were collateral damage. OK, Matt Damon and Jodie Foster cannot be brought back to life?? The villain was brought back to life after being dead two hours and half his head cut off! Stupid. I wanted to see more of Elysium. Isn't that why you go to the movies? To escape and be wowed and be privy to a fantasy world?? There was NONE of that. You literally see as much of Elysium as is shown in the trailer. About three quick scenes. No characters are developed on Elysium. There could have been so much fun to show life and technology and decadence, but the characters don't even do their fight scenes in the fancy houses, they fight in a factory setting! Guess it saved a lot of money on sets! The jittery hand-held camera work was bad. No need to edit the scenes since they are blurry and choppy and you can't see what is going on anyway. Matt Damon, a kick ass actor who was given nothing. I could care less if he ends up with his leading woman. No real moments, just clichés and they had absolutely NO chemistry. She lives in a dump with her daughter and no husband, and when hunky Matt Damon asks her out she says NO?? WTF? It sucked and then she tells him her daughter is dying and he walks out the door. (Except for a cheesy scene which was like a Hallmark moment.) BTW all the cute little girls on Earth were dying of a disease that could only be cured on Elysium. The kids were too cutesy and did not have real personalities. Another complaint is that I truly did NOT want the people of earth to get to Elysium. They were unlikeable. Why is it that they were portrayed as filthy and greasy?? I know plenty of people without money who are nice and clean and neat as a pin. They were criminals and just plain gross. They cannot brush their hair? Matt Damon is the only one who works in his neighborhood? It was like the filmmakers were bigots toward impoverished people to portray them that way. Oh yeah, and Matt is exposed to a full dose of radiation at the start of the film, and THEN he saves the world? I'm sorry, make him have liver failure or cancer or an infection. DO NOT give him acute radiation poisoning and expect us to believe he can carry on, have major surgery, recover and save the world. Duh. And BTW, why would all these criminals let him even come near them when he is contaminated? I also think they should have made the earthlings surgery much cleaner. It was stupid to believe Matt could recover from surgery in that filthy chop shop. His apparatus bolted into his body was ridiculous. It was like two tire pumps screwed into him. The chop shop was another reason to dislike the earthlings. Organization does not cost anything. They could be organized and have lights in their surgery. They have a huge war room with technology so why no lights? They had water, and I'm sorry, if you are sitting around all day with no day job, you can learn how to make your own soap! Jodie Foster did what she could. I wanted to see more of her party, her house, her life. Would have been so cool to have Matt Damon sneak up there and have an affair with her or something. Now that would have been a good story. Jodie looks absolutely beautiful. Villain was super annoying. He was like spitting out one-liners constantly and I hated him because he was annoying, not scary. Another thing they did was make all the houses the criminals (earthlings) broke into empty. No one was ever in the Elysium houses. Why? Because you did not want to write dialog? Maybe there would be a nice family who would help. It would have been so much more satisfying. It was just so lacking in any personality, I feel bad because I think they must have had a limited budget or something, so no time spent on the story or scenes of Elysium. It could have been great, so it was a lost opportunity.

I'm going to cut out the B.S. and get right down to the reasons I hated this film. In no particular order: 1. Matt Damon plays himself like he does in every movie. Only difference this time is he's playing himself as if he's not feeling well.2. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the first 45 minutes.3. The space view of Elysium is the only interesting visual effect in the entire movie.4. The plot and plot twist make absolutely no sense. But that's okay because you've seen this movie before anyway, it's like every other hollow movie you've seen.

Add Matt Damon to the Michael Moore Club. Rich white guys who complain that everyone else is racist and stingy, yet they make trillions of dollars saying this stuff. So Damon is the hero and wants to make life "equal" for everyone?Let's see what happens if I, another white guy, try to storm his mansion and put his stuff in the street for the rabble to take home free of charge. There are ways to bring people up economically. Start with sharing your massive wealth with the poor, Mr. Damon. Quietly give 90% of it away. You can surely live on 10% of what you earn, and live nicely. Decent special effects, but I've grown tired of political agendas. The vast majority of sheep who gave this more higher than a 4 will just walk away and vote for Obama, anyway.

This film represents a natural evolution of the rough, intense, deeply sociopolitical textures that Neill Bloomkamp previously worked with in District 9. Many comparisons can be made between D9 and Elysium; they're both particularly ugly films that face certain ugly truths through the thin veil of sci-fi, and they're both set in some of the trashiest slums ever filmed. At the same time, Elysium borrows a lot from the anime Battle Angel; both are stories in which the rich and poor are separated between the Earth and some high-flying city, and the characters fight their way to the top with some help from cybernetics. There are also individual scenes that reminded me of other things: one scene reminded me of Total Recall, the main henchman was like an evil version of Metal Gear's Solid Snake, I couldn't help but to think of the Ghost in the Shell saga and the works of William Gibson with all the high-tech surveillance ops and brain-hacking.Despite being somewhat unoriginal, Elysium is every bit as awesome and awe-inspiring as I expected. The action hits hard and rough, with frequent fights and shoot-outs, all made even more explosive and incredible with a plethora of futuristic gear. The film can get pretty gruesome, for there are a few exploding bodies and painful-looking injuries, but it's still nowhere near as gnarly as District 9. Some incredible slow-motion shots and gorgeous special effects make the excitement stand out even more. In between the action scenes, the film maintains even pacing with strong conflicts and quality visuals.As noted above, the story covers pretty standard sci-fi ground. It does employ some interesting concepts though: the actual Elysium space station is a magnificent utopic space habitat (a Stanford Torus design), the likes of which is often envisioned by futurists and sci-fi authors, but has never actually been produced on the big screen for some odd reason. The world of Elysium is visually fantastic and really cool.The actual plot is solidly-built, with its foundations firmly set in conflict and action. It takes some really interesting twists and turns; the climax is a little predictable, but everything leading up to it is a real roller-coaster ride. Characters aren't particularly deep; the villains are especially one-dimensional. However, the film does its best to humanize the heroes and the poor people they fight for, to best emphasize its key themes. The themes are not all that subtle, and the political stance is not something I personally agree with, but I appreciate the effort and nobility of the film, as it underscores such hot topics as immigration, healthcare, and class warfare.This film uses pretty rough and gritty photography and editing. The camera does shake around a bit during some scenes, but it didn't agitate me nearly as much as I thought it would: I could see the action perfectly well, and I thought a lot of the camera angles and compositions were cool. Acting is alright: Matt Damon is a pretty generic action hero here, Sharlto Copley (hey, the dude from District 9) is flipping crazy, and Alice Braga offers the most touching performance of the lot. Surprisingly, Jodie Foster is the weakest link, thanks to her butchery of the French accent. Writing is not bad. This picture has really cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is pretty good too.I felt this was a perfectly satisfying and awesome sci-fi adventure, despite a few quibbles. District 9 remains a fresher, more original, and more deeper experience; I think it's because it offered something nobody had really seen before. Elysium, on the other hand, offers something we've all seen before, so it hasn't struck as hard with audiences. Personally, I think I prefer Elysium over D9, for having a more complex plot, more incredible action, and more far-out ideas. Both would make a great double-feature, and I do hope director Neill Bloomkamp continues to pump out similarly raw and uncompromising pictures. If you're a big sci-fi fan like me, Elysium is definitely worth seeing; I'd recommend it as a rental to casual viewers.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

Elysium is a good movie because of the special effects, an entertaining plot line, and Sharlto Copley's acting as character Kruger. This movie, like District 9 before it, has amazing and realistic special effects and direction for that matter. Neill Blomkamp has a style that is unmatched. His movies are futuristic, beautiful, and strikingly realistic looking. The plot line of Elysium my be interpreted as left leaning in that it is about equality and caring for everyone. I thought that the film to a story that should be told in a creative and action-packed method. Lastly, Sharlto Copley is the best there is. Maybe it's just my sick sense of humor, but there is no better villain than the character Kruger, played by Copley. He is convincingly evil while incredibly likable, which creates a great villain. In the end I am almost rooting for Kruger. His actions are totally unpredictable. He stole every scene. The movie is worth seeing for Copley's performance alone.

Okay, so Elysium, a film (without giving away any spoilers)about Immigration, the gap between rich and poor, and dystopia's. All fairly generic sci if, but where this film differs (in a way I personally dislike) is that it's rather heavy handed. by which I mean the citizens of 3rd-world-earth all speak Spanish, and all the people on Elysium speak either English, or french. This, for me is why it deserves a six star review. Ignoring these blunders however, it's a solid flick. Or rather its enjoyable. Is it a classic? no, far from it. But it's watchable, and ignoring the extremely ham fisted political commentary which you may or may not agree with, it's relatively well done, and gorgeous to look at. In short: very political, which could please or disgust you, but beyond that it's enjoyable.

This movie is lacking an explanation as to why the privileged want to live full time in a space station considering the enormous risks of living in outer space like radiation exposure, loss of eyesight, loss of muscle mass, and space motion sickness.The sheer cost of maintaining a space habitat with artificial gravity, a breathable atmosphere, radiation protection, etc would be immense. Earth has all these nice things built in to it and it is also much larger then a space station.As such, in order for it to be reasonable to maintain a habitat in outer space rather then one on Earth it must be the case that the Earth is really messed up such as with the sky scorched like in the Matrix or something equally terrible.In this movie people are going about their daily lives on Earth and they have food, water, sunlight, air and all the other necessities provided for. Therefore, the premise of this movie that the privileged would live on a space habitat makes no sense. This movie is lacking an explanation in why things are this way so nothing really makes sense.One of the fundamental points in this movie is that in the space station they have futuristic medical technology that can cure any sickness essentially instantly. This movie is also lacking any explanation as to how the people on the space station can maintain a monopoly on such advanced technology or why they would even want to so that whole element of the plot doesn't make much sense either.Besides these major elements that this story is lacking I feel this story is also lacking some explanation as to what happened to Max between when he was a child and when he was an adult. They just show Max as a child and then they switch to him as a tattooed adult with only brief mentions of his past later on. Well this movie wasn't all bad I feel it may have been more interesting to see the elements of Max's past this film was lacking like his car thefts rather then bothering with the plot about a space station which lacks a decent explanation as to its existence.

OK, I know D9 is loved by many sci-fi lovers and I have no idea why this is the case. It was one of the worst sci-fi's I've ever watched to be honest. So, any movie could be better than it and naturally Elysium is one of them. But still this one also have problems as casting and story.Yes, casting. Although I like Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, they seem like very wrong choices for this movie. Very cold and soulless. In fact the whole movie seems cold and soulless. That was also the main problem of D9. I guess Blomkamp really needs to work on sympathetic & enthusiastic film characters. Or maybe this is not his main aim, he wants to concentrate on coldness & hostility in human nature. Then the question remains, why the hell did I watch his both films?? Aaah sci-fi marketing, how you suck! :-w

ELYSIUM (2013) **1/2 Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, Sharlto Copley, Alice Braga, Diego Luna, Wagner Moura, William Fichtner, Brandon Auret, Josh Blacker, Emma Tremblay. Hodgepodge sci-fi dystopia from filmmaker Neill Blomkamp with Damon as an ex-con living in hell-on-Earth in a wasteland that is LA in 2154 where the well-to-do live in a cosmic gated community space station that is about to get its just desserts when he unwittingly gains access to info about its NSA officer Foster (channeling Dick Cheney in Hillary Clinton's pant suits yet!) who's plans for a coup will endanger all of the world's struggling populace. While there are some inventive special effects and a good turn by Damon, the film feels cobbled together from '2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY'; take your pick of any Philip K. Dick mind-f#@k flick; any TWILIGHT ZONE and pretty much every sci-fi flick in the past 30 years; what's old is new again for the most part - the future sucks.

This movie had good actors, good acting, great special affects, and stunning landscapes, but it just didn't do it for me. The plot was slow to take off and I found the plot rather boring. I loved everything about this movie except the storyline and I left the theatres scratching my head as to why I didn't like this movie.I never liked District 9 and this movie has the same kind of style to it, so maybe that's why I didn't like it. Matt Damon as a sci fi hero...I found that very interesting and was hoping I would like it, but I think Matt should stick to the genres that he has done in the past. He's great at drama, great at spy/military/soldier type movies. I like him in a lot of the movies he does, and honestly, his acting was great in this movie. I just didn't like the story. And Matt looks weird with a shaved head.(girls perspective) I think that a lot of hard core sci fi fans will like this movie and I'm recommending it would be worth going to see, just to check it out and see if you like it. If you hated District 9, I probably wouldn't go see this movie as it has a very similar feel to it.I gave this movie a rating of 5 because I hated the story line.

I'd give it a 7.5/10 honestly, the visual and special effects in this film are remarkable and should be rightly appreciated. The acting from Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, and Sharlto Copley, William Fichtner, and the rest of the cast are electrifying. However, I felt that some of the characters were too short lived and there was a lack of their development, specifically Jodie Foster's role. The film kind if delved right into their mantra without really any sort of background or progression of the characters, this is where I felt some of a misconnection with the film and its characters and is the basis for my 7.5 rating. Nonetheless, the film is very action packed and suspenseful guided by great special effects, specifically the weaponry and gadgets induced in the film were very cool. Damon and Copley definitely gave great performances, I think Copley stole the show though with his performance in portraying the psychotic military operative stuck on earth. All in all it is a great movie to go see in theaters, as a huge fan of District 9, Elysium is in the vicinity of the greatness D9 gave, but still needed more in the end.

Elysium is a worth follow up to Neil Blomkamp's District 9. Its got thrilling action, awesome visuals and a couple of really good performances. However it doesn't quite reach the level of greatness that District 9 achieved. Is that a bad thing? That depends, they are 2 separate movies, but with Neil Blomkamp's premier movie being so amazing you really cant help but walk into this movie with very high expectations. If there's one thing that I didn't find overly compelling about this movie is that the story just didn't impress me. The concept is excellent and a very scary view of what our future could very well look like if the gap between the middle class and upper class continues to grow but the story that was wrapped around the concept for some reason didn't fascinate me. The film has a great message and is very entertaining but the overall feeling I had when I walked out was "That was a movie." This film defiantly deserves to be watched as its very entertaining and fans of Matt Damon are sure to enjoy this film. District 9's Shartlo Copley does an excellent job as the films villain. I'd say in my opinion you could be fine waiting to just rent this one.

While in District 9 Neill Blomkamp did a fine effort of trying to show the results of racial segregation from the point of view of an oppressor becoming an oppressed one (ultimately failing to make it even a bit believable, though) in Elysium he has hit the nail precisely on the head, forgetting to put it against a wall first.The premise is pretty worn - two communities, one a small, rich and prosperous, the other large but poor and suffering. And, obviously, a tale of one man's rise to citizenship of the rich one. What Elysium completely fails to create is a reason to feel for any of the characters. The bad guys are bad because Neill said so, the good guys are good by virtue of being poor and oppressed (we all know that every miserable sod has a heart of gold but is unwilling to sell it). So the good guys fight the bad guys. sacrifice themselves left and right and, obviously, win.Also the movie contains so many absolutely stupid details that it becomes a pain to watch without facepalming. Every stupid action/sci-fi cliché you can think of is probably there.Oh, and as for the message. Earth = Cuba/Mexico. Elysium = USA. Brave immigrants fight through border patrol and decimate U.S. citizens to achieve their small American dream. Kindly empathize with them.

Is Elysium the masterpiece of thought-provoking sci-fi cinema of 2013? No. Is it the masterpiece of action and spectacle of 2013? No. Is it terrible or a total letdown? No.And given that, it's a much more entertaining 'thinker' sci-fi than Oblivion, which was really trying too hard and overstuffed with convenient clichéd or fortuitous plot devices. In comparison, the only similar type of plot device that made me really groan was the defense mechanisms of the Elysium space station: a rather laughable construct used just to force the allegory of today's illegal immigration problems in the USA.Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley give strong performances as opposing characters. For the most part (except for a couple of brief scenes), continuity is maintained well for the deteriorating state of Damon's character's health. Their first battle has exhilarating staging.Personally, I really enjoyed Jodie Foster's full-tilt aristocrat, but I can see where some will be turned-off by her accent and execution. I think she pulled it off.Outside of the above, and where Elysium falls down a bit, is that no one else is very memorable. There's an underground resistance leader (Diego Luna) who's solid, but a bit of a cardboard character, and William Fichtner puts in a short deliciously loathsome performance as an Elysium elitist. But, Damon's love interest, Alice Braga, is 'just there', and there is a needless subplot involving her injured daughter which really plays more as the standard abhorrent 'child in distress' cliché.While you get a glimpse of the disparity between the Haves and the Have Not's, you really don't get to see that much of the 'star of the show' (Elysium itself), and the story feels a bit empty being focused primarily on the 3 main stars. Fleshing out the plot is sacrificed for action at the end of the day. Which is not to say the movie is bad overall. It's a decent watch, and pretty stunning in an IMAX theater. It just could have been more.

Damon's, Foster's and Copley's acting is on the level, but this movie is so weak in terms of concept and plot that I seriously regretted spending money seeing it. Dystopias work well when they work, but one has to spend at least 10 minutes of thinking and at least try aiming for justification and creating something the viewer can easily immerse in. The movie does very poorly in this regard and though Elysium is probably the best Mass Effect Citadel station rip off I have seen in cinema you cannot build belief on the basis of 10 mins of sloppy presentation and CGI alone.Copley's character is quite, quite fresh and as I said Damon and Foster do well, but that's it. I honestly didn't believe I'd say a weaker sci-fi movie since I saw Total Recall (redux), but there we go...Would recommend seeing on blu-ray at $5 on a rainy night but don't keep your expectations high.

Probably only delayed things a bit I'd guess, but the have-nots got a nice little win. As our super hero, he received a very ample share of flesh wounds but he dug deep, swallowed the pills, and got the win. NO pain, NO gain man. I enjoyed watching the video game transporters, robot police, and the melancholy pristine Elysium scene. You may relate to this movie to current times, as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Don't tell your sub-conscious, but the seeds have been planted to join the political movement now. Bottom line, another interesting guess of the future, where we ordered up a combo platter of I-Robot, Terminator, and Mad Max.

The incredible disappointing summer blockbusters of 2013 come to a close with August slipping away from our grasp.A quick recap of the summer: Star Trek 2 got good reviews but I sadly did not get to see it. The Man of Steel gets shot down with poor critical reception. Iron Man 3 was just OK, if that. World War Zombie or whatever was awful, and Del Toro's Pacific Rim, although lacked heart, was completely badass but lost in the box office to GROWN UPS 2 (i'll just let that sink in for a little bit). So a sequel to that is about as unlikely as a life long marriage between Kim and Kanye. So you could say that this summer was a huge let down.I had high hopes for Elysium. Its Neil Blomkamp's second attempt at his signature "smart-sci-fi" movies, the first one being the amazing "District 9". Also, it has a bald Matt Damon in a dirty robot suit fighting the rich with sweet guns on a giant floating Halo in the sky. Oh yeah, and its also about health care.Now that I think about it, it could've fallen flat on its face.This film, being a movie with an opinionated message concerning the rich and the poor, gets very mixed reviews. It did OK in its opening weekend, and barely managed to NOT score a rotten on Rotten Tomatoes. So what makes it one of the best films of 2013 (the other being The Place Beyond The Pines)? I'll tell you. Its the explosive action and gripping realism behind this applause-worthy hour-and-a-half sci-fi thriller.The scenery and cinematography are breathtaking, and none of it feels CGI or fake. Especially the way Blomkamp tackles these gritty robotic tales: giant planes are pushed to the background or not in focus because they aren't a big deal to the people of 2154. This is directing at its best.The performances are almost all top notch across the board. Matt Damon plays a likable protagonist named Max who wants to help people, but his hint of selfishness inside him sometimes holds him back. He does a lot of the stunt work himself, and he plays his character well to make him enjoyable to watch on screen. I really cared about his character, which really surprised me. Max's teammates do not appear in all that much of the movie, but are enjoyable as well. While some are a little over the top (Spyder, played by Wagner Moura), there are others that are loyal to Max and try to help him on his journey (Diego Luna as Julio), and serve as one of Max's motivations to fight the "bad guys".Jodie Foster, however, is a different story. She gives a lazy performance as Delacourt. Her accent in the movie annoyed me, and her lines, while well-written, felt unnatural and uninspired, due to her over the top delivery. Oh well, you're supposed to hate her character anyway, so I guess it worked. Alice Braga is good as the main love interest. She and Max have a complex relationship that existed long before the events of the film, so the romance does not feel forced at all. It's very unusual for a summer blockbuster, I know.Sharlto Copley as Kruger seems like another one of Delacourt's hired guns at first, but once his story and Max's story cross, he shows his true colors. Kruger is a totally different role for Copley, but he manages to own the role. He made Kruger feel just as likable and fun as he was menacing. He steals every scene he's in, making the third act exciting and full of life.The plot, while at first glance seems generic, is actually a metaphor for foreign immigration. Elysium is basically America's wealthy, and Earth holds America's less-fortunate, as well as foreign ethnic groups including Max, who appears to be part of the Spanish heritage. Some might call Elysium racist, but I completely disagree and think it tackles a very apparent problem in our society and hits it hard into my brain without being too preachy.When there is action, it is brutal, intense, and jaw dropping. There's plenty of big budget explosions and eye candy. Cars are spinning and flipping, robots are exploding, planes are crashing, grenades are taking people's faces clean off, and amazing high-tech guns are literally blowing up people, not to mention some serious hand to hand combat that was worth the price of admission alone. Despite all of this, I wouldn't call this movie an action movie. What shines over this action is the deep drama between the characters and the heart that this movie really has.The ending may be identified as cliché to some folks, but I thought it tied this futuristic ride up in a nice little bow. See, even if you don't agree with Elysium's message, I can't seem to shake the fact that Blomkamp made this movie with passion, and at a rare occasion: during another summer movie season in 2013.Great script, good characters, interesting premise, amazing spectacle, and a controversial but powerful message that leaves you thinking long after the credits. Sounds like my kind of movie. Is it yours?For me, this easily deserves a 9/10. Tell me what you think. Cheers.

Everyone is up in arms about the supposed message behind Elysium, when let's face it, were the circumstances in our real world the same as in Elysium, that is EXACTLY how it would be.For those who have not seen it, the basic premise is that the rich and privileged live on Elysium (a space station with an artificial environment) while the poor are left on an overpopulated Earth that is ruined and decrepit. On Elysium they have medical technology that is not located on Earth and inaccessible to the citizens of Earth. Max (Matt Damon) gets radiation poisoning and the only way for him to not die is to get help on Elysium. So, he does everything humanly (and sometimes not humanly) possible to get there and get fixed. **MAJOR SPOILER ALERT: If you don't want the ending to be spoiled, skip to the next paragraph.** Through a hijack, he ends up with a file in his head that will reset Elysium and allow anyone to change what they want. Jodie Foster's character needs the file to make herself President, but removing the file would kill Max. In the end, Max sacrifices himself and initiates the reboot so that his associate Spider can make everyone on Earth a citizen.What has everyone outraged and hate-filled in regards to this movie, in my opinion, that it's calling attention to everything they close their eyes to and pretend does not exist. Earth IS becoming overpopulated. The rich DO have access to medical technology that the poor do not, simply because they can afford it. Were Earth to become the wasteland that it is in Elysium, the rich would undoubtedly evacuate.I, myself, am a conservative. I avoid all news stations because each has it's own slant whether is one way or the other, none are fair and balanced, but in most of my views, I lean to the right. Despite that, I LOVED this movie. Why? Because I watched it for the story. So what if it has a message that you don't agree with? (I don't necessarily agree with the message, but I see the points of it) It is still a good movie, with a good story and good acting. Not to mention: superb directing on Neill Blomkamp's behalf.This movie is amazing, my new favorite, and I highly recommend that you go see it without a mind tainted by misguided preconceived notions obtained from Fox News, MSNBC, or any other news syndicate.10/10

This movie has delivered on many aspects, but also falls short on others. The CGI and other set pieces are absolutely amazing. The story is good, although not great. The action sequences are great, except for one (we'll get to that in a moment). One of the few problems that I had is that while the characters were good, non of them really grabbed my attention and made me care about them. There weren't any horrible plot holes. The one everyone throws out is that Matt Damon's character, Max, dies, and can't be brought back, but Sharlto's character, Kruger, gets to recover from a grenade to the face. It explains this kind of in the movie. As long as the brain is good, you're good. Max's brain was damaged, so he couldn't be brought back. Anyway, another problem that I saw was a particular fight scene that I couldn't even tell who was who because the shaky cam was going rampant. But despite a few negative aspects, the positive ones shine through, and make this movie worth a watch. Although, if you don't like gore, I would be wary of this film.

Greetings again from the darkness. Social commentary does not automatically make a movie "smart". In fact, commentary done poorly could be labeled the exact opposite. Writer/Director Neil Blomkamp's critically acclaimed sci-fi feature District 9 was creative in its approach to social issues. Unfortunately, his follow-up is a sloppy, big budget mess with too many writing shortcuts and what may be the worst performances of Jodie Foster's career.Earth in the year 2154 is an over-populated, polluted disaster that looks like what we saw in Wall-E, only with people. Earth is so bad, it has been evacuated by the ultra-rich ... an obvious statement on the "one percenters". The poor and downtrodden earthlings spend their lives dreaming of getting to Elysium, the space station paradise that houses the elite and is only a 19 minute shuttle ride away. On Elysium, the houses are stunning and the lawns perfectly manicured. Oh, and technology has re-imagined tanning booths into a medical marvel that can cure anything from zits to cancer. This advancement is the main reason earthlings risk everything to reach Elysium. See those poor folks have only shoddy hospitals ... an obvious statement on universal healthcare.After an industrial accident, Max (Matt Damon)is desperate to reach Elysium so he can save his own life. As expected, his selfishness evolves into focused heroism after he runs into his childhood crush Frey (Alice Braga) and her leukemia-stricken daughter. Getting yourself to Elysium is not so easy thanks to the protective nature of Defense Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster). She is working with greedy businessman William Fichtner and earth-based mercenary Sharlto Copley to plot her political coup on Elysium ... just in case you forgot that the rich are really bad people.There is a data theft plot that, if re-directed, could open up the Elysium advantages to the entire population ... an obvious statement on open immigration. In between all of the political statements Blomkamp does throw in plenty of explosions, gun fights, aggressive robots and enough CGI effects to keep any sci-fi fan entertained. There is even a battle of exoskeleton suits between Copley and Damon. Where Arnold once said "Get your a** to Mars", I can't in good faith say the same thing about Elysium.

The metaphor works like this: Elysium is the United States and the earth is Mexico. The people on earth are trying to run across the boarder (low earth orbit) to Elysium to get free health care. OMG. Are you joking. I could understand if Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in the film, I mean his scripts are written in crayon, right? But not the great talent, Jodie Foster. What was she thinking? The plot had more holes than a colander. The 2 dimensional and unimaginative writers do nothing to develop the characters in fact there is a scene were the president of Elysium himself chases down a terrorist. What? Little or no time is given to the people of Elysium much less Jodie Foster's character who only has a hand full of speaking parts. The only reason I went to see this movie was to see Jodie Foster knock one out of the park, again. She is so talented and has always been very selective about the films she stars in. They either cut out a lot of her parts or paid her a lot of money to act in this poorly thought out film. If you have to see this movie either wait two weeks for it to go to the cheap theaters or a couple of months to get on Net Flix. Not worth the money. Sorry Jodie.

"Elysium" is a dull sermon about Obamacare and open borders in the guise of a so-so Sci-fi flic. The didactic aspect of the film is so heavy- handed it takes you right out of the movie, out of the willing suspension of disbelief. It doesn't help that "Elysium" lacks the arresting characters, clever plotting, or wowee special effects that break science fiction films out beyond the genre's die-hard fans. It's 2154 in a dystopic Los Angeles. LA is ugly and garbage-strewn, in a futuristic way. Almost everyone in LA is Hispanic or at least speaks Spanish. Max (Matt Damon), a bald and tattooed ex-con trying to go straight, is forced into taking on a high-risk crime for Spider (Wagner Moura), a crime lord. Max has to travel to Elysium, a space station where rich white Americans live in beauty and luxury, unlike the cursed denizens of earth, who are mostly Hispanic and live in garbage strewn slums and can't get adequate medical care. Elysium has med-beds. If you lie down on a med-bed, no matter what your ailment is, the med-bed will cure you.Spider is plotting to breach Elysium's security and take it over, thus making med-beds and Elysium's breathtaking beauty available to all. He faces formidable foes. Jodie Foster is the white, blonde Elysium antagonist. She is trying to protect Elysium from the Hispanic immigrants and sick people in search of health care who are attempting to enter. Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley, a South African actor, is her evil tool. There is no attempt to explain why someone with such a pronounced South African accent lives in LA. In any case, Copley's performance of an enthusiastic sadist is the best thing about the film. There is a lot of chasing. Men put on metallic costumes that give them special powers. There are your usual hyped up guns and there are also some knives and swords. A lot of this feels like expedient cheating, as it always does in fantasy movies. There are special devices that detect runaways. Max is able to elude these super smart devices by hiding under pigs. The movie never explains, as these movies never explain, the rules of such gadgetry. If a character needs to get away to advance the plot, some trick will help him to get away. I live in a non-futuristic, garbage-strewn slum. We have had liberal, Democratic government for generations. See Detroit. We've been hearing the same message for generations, the same message "Elysium" sends: "It's us versus them. We are human; they are cold and cruel. They live lives of perfect bliss. Their health problems are all taken care of. They only way for us to achieve anything is to take what they have." This message, even in a grade C sci-fi flick, is toxic. Liberals do not help us, the poor, by telling us that we have nothing of value in ourselves, that it is only through taking what the rich have that we can have lives of value. Poor people do not benefit by discounting what they have and living lives of passive, deluded envy, focusing on what the rich have rather than focusing on their own skills and blessings, and cultivating their own opportunities. If the Earthlings of "Elysium" succeeded in their goal, it wouldn't end there. It would end as the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Iranian Revolution and others ended: with terror, torture, rape, chaos, and "meet the new boss; same as the old boss." The real revolution starts when we look within and outside ourselves with love.

It was the big weekend movie, and I was attracted to the premise, so I ventured out to see "Elysium." In this one, we are transported to 2154, a time when the very wealthy live on a man-made space station in orbit high above an overpopulated, impoverished, disease-ridden, and polluted Earth. The planet is patrolled by robot cops who protect the interests of the wealthy overlords who emulate the Great Gatsby on the rotating tea cart in the sky. This, of course, upsets the people on Earth, who know that there is a machine on Elysium that can cure all illness. When our hero, played by Matt Damon, gets a lethal dose of on-the-job radiation, he sets forth on a mission to equalize civilization. As luck would have it, the security lady on Elysium (Jody Foster) wants more power and launches a plot to take over the space station, but Matt and his pals intervene. Foster plays the heartless security woman it like she is Meredith Baxter Birney in a bad Lifetime made-for-TV movie.There are other big flaws: A 2003 GMC Truck that still runs (I am still trying to figure out where they got gas for it), a metal contraption that is put on Damon to make him strong, but it doesn't seem to work (I hope he saved the receipt, so he can return it to Exo-skeletons R Us), not to mention incandescent incandescent light bulbs and computers that look like they were recently bought from Staples. This all does nothing to revive what is a tired plot.In spite of all that, it is not a bad movie and will keep you entertained for a few hours with some decent special effects and some characters you will care about, so I will give this a two out of Fordyce. Place it in the category of another Summer 2013 lackluster, big-budget blockbuster wannabe.Jim's Credit Check: There is no bonus scene at the end of the credits.

I had several problems with this movie. The ending went on far too long, leaving a bad after-taste. I also hated how the politics of the current day were injected so blatantly into the movie - I don't go to a supposed science fiction movie to get lectured about political issues (illegals). I want escapism from a sci-fi movie above all. Damon is the only thing good in the entire film. He gives it a good college try, but he can't save this movie from failure. A very awkward story line about a childhood sweetheart runs throughout, and the love interest is cold as a fish, and there is no chemistry between Damon's character and her. None of the other characters make an impression.This movie felt really clunky and unsubtle and just awkward is the best way to put it. Recycled robots from other better sci-fi movies didn't help matters. The space station, Elysium, was kind of cool, but that is about it. 5 Stars only because Damon is always an engaging presence to watch, even in a lousy movie like this one.

I couldn't decide whether to give this a 6 or a 7. Either way this film has its strengths and has its weaknesses. It all just eventually cancels out to the point where there really isn't a score to rank it. It isn't a good movie, but at the end it isn't a very bad one either. Neil Blonkamp is probably one of my top ten contemporary directors. Props for him for finding an original, solid story to satisfy moviegoers. However, it can only satisfy. The characters are a little flat, except for Sharlto Copley's (which I will get to later), it gets to the point where some of these are screaming to be noticed before they're thrown to the side. I liked the three leads though, Matt Damon gives a strong performance as always. I was pretty surprised where Jodie Foster went, this is definitely a change of pace for her, and I really don't know what to think. Sharlto Copley was the stand out for this film. He hasn't been in much since his flop The A-Team, but this guy has range. I'm excited to hear that he's doing some more stuff this year. The effects I thought were outstanding. I know that its pretty much expected these days that effects have to be great in films, but in my opinion these are probably one of the best ones this year. The film has its weak spots, but Blomkamp does give it his all directing-wise. But in the end, it's really your choice if it's worth seeing

The movie starts off explaining how the world became overpopulated and how the rich people fled to a place called "Elysium" where you can live for hundreds of years and be cured of any disease or handicap you might come across. Which, lets be honest, if that's how things turn out to be, might be pretty awesome.There is also a little back story of Matt Damon's character as a child growing up along side a young girl named "Frey". They are the best of friends and it's his promise to one day take them to Elysium.The cinematography might be the best part of the film. The way the world is portrayed as an overpopulated mess is brilliant in my opinion. A very grimy and dark place to live and you get the feeling no one wants to be there. And then you see Elysium and how beautiful it is. I also liked the way it was designed.Anyway, back to the story. Damon's character becomes exposed to a severe amount of radiation that will kill him in 5 days. The only way to survive is to get to Elysium. That's when the action begins and we get action sequences which are a bit gruesome but entertaining nonetheless. However, some of those scenes are shot with a hand-held camera so it becomes shaky which I don't like at all. But, it doesn't take away too much from the movie.Jodie Foster plays the villain who wants all the power of Elysium in her pocket. It doesn't get explained but I'm assuming on Earth, there is no more President or Vice President, etc. But in one scene after Foster's character does something without authority, she gets summoned by the President. So I'm assuming that means all the big authorities live on Elysium. Anyway, she doesn't like the way it's being run and wants to do something about it. It's just, I'm not sure if she was trying for a French/American accent or any accent for that matter, you don't enjoy the movie while she's on screen. But maybe that makes the movie work.Bottom line for me, if you enjoy science fiction movies, you will enjoy this one. It's an interesting take on what could happen should the earth become overpopulated. It's not as good as Bloomkamp's first movie "Distric 9" but it had me entertained from beginning to end.

Elysium was by no means what I had hoped for but was an enjoyable theater experience nonetheless for any SciFi nerd. The CG was superb and the set and design teams did an amazing job. Overall the acting was effective, primarily from Jodie Foster(Delacourt) and Sharlto Copley(Kruger), complimented by the rest of the cast who were fairly believable in their roles. Where Elysium falls short is primarily in the story. There were so many plot holes that it actually began to hinder me from completely enjoying the film. Truth be told its a SciFi and plot holes are expected but in abundance can become overwhelming. *********SPOILERS BELOW**********************SPOILERS**********My biggest grudge with the film was why the inhabitants of Elysium horded the machines that were capable of curing any physical ailment. You would think a machine of such capabilities would be hard to come by or cost some unforeseen toll for using it. Unfortunately, they appear in the film as a standard household appliance. Not only that, the machines work in mere seconds!! The film even contradicted itself having Med shuttles with over 30 machines in them. If every house already has one of these machines, it works instantly, there is no war on Elysium, and the main concern in keeping Elysium secure is keeping the inhabitants of earth out, why in gods name were these shuttles even created? Better yet, why weren't they already on earth healing people? Even the machines themselves contradicted the purpose of Elysium. Elysium was created because of overpopulation on earth, which inevitably leads to pollution. If you've created a machine that essentially is the fountain of youth, are you not setting yourself up for overpopulation on Elysium?The idea of Elysium wasn't established to the audience. To me Elysium was nothing more than a gated community for the rich and famous. There were no signs of its actual independence or separation from earth aside from its obvious distance. In fact, it was Elysium that still needed earth. Only by standing on the shoulders of the many could these people reach such positions of power. The inhabitants of earth simply had to go on strike at the factories of these powerful people or boycott their products until their ethical and humane demands of being healed were met. Not only that, if history has taught anyone anything people are willing to go to war for less. Boston Tea Party much?Another small but annoying plot hole was when Elysium was reset. In resetting itself the film clearly showed the entire place shutting down i.e. losing power, lights, etc. Remember we are living in space on a man made creation with artificial gravity and atmosphere and we've suddenly lost power? Lets just think about this a few seconds... ******END SPOILERS******Don't let my critical nature prevent anyone from seeing this film in theaters. It really wasn't that bad of a movie. It wasn't as good as Pacific Rim, but the films more positive areas made it reasonably close.What the film should have done was made living on Elysium itself the very cure to ailments. You have a beautiful man made world with an atmosphere and every other element controlled by humans. The world was essentially pure and could be maintained so, allowing such things as long life and health to be possible. Even faster regeneration from physical trauma could be feasible if explained by mixing certain elements into the atmosphere. To contrast the beautiful world, the entire population of Elysium would have to be ugly. By ugly I mean share similar personality traits like Delacourt and Kruger who abuse the people of earth for their personal gain. X leads to Y and Matt Damon goes to Elysium for whatever reason, but ends up destroying it. The way Elysium is destroyed happens in a way that it is totally disintegrated so it doesn't leave massive debris to be sucked into earths gravitational pull. Instead all that is left from Elysium is a glitter like haze which comes into our atmosphere. The SciFi twist would be the ashes of Elysium inadvertently begin to heal the people of earth.

I never thought Jodie Foster could be in a bad film? It seemed unbelievable that Damon could be part of something so terrible? Yet it has happened. Other than some neat special effects, we are once again treated to a film where the outline never grew to a completed project. Here are the rich versus the poor, a bit of programming that could change history, and yes, poor people speak Spanish and rich people converse in French. On top of that the main thug speaks in an intelligible accent, and Elysium resembles a hybrid of Beverly Hills and Southern Florida. This is just the beginning.There is the martyr figure played by Damon who is on his way to redeem himself from making a few mistakes while being young. An old girlfriend shows up with a sick child, and the rebels in the late 21st century look even worse than the citizens of "Waterworld". While we follow the thinnest of stories whose end we can see from the beginning credits, we are also treated to some of the most jarring and jumpy camera-work ever seen in a big Hollywood production. The dialogue is at best amateurish and not very interesting, particularly when we think about how sophisticated audiences are nowadays.What is worse is that we don't have much to care about in this film. The best about the villain is how well she dresses, but even her acting feels listless. She might as well be ordering food over the phone when she wants some spaceships shot down. Then there is the look of the technology of the period. Everybody's spacecraft looks like something out of a cereal box, the robots are cheap copies of something we have seen before, and we really shouldn't care for this. After all, "Star Wars" was at first big on charm, story, and a great mix of editing/direction. This time the goal must have been to mix every target.What is next? We are all waiting for J.J. to come through and save the genre, again?

Visually great! Great action! ...but god-awful story/plot.In real life, if you like:* lawlessness * amnesty for illegal aliens * class warfare * the idea of "global" governance * forging of government-IDs, and * government-run health insurance...then you'll LOVE this movie!!!This movie is another flavor of Avatar, and James Cameron in his "60 Minutes" interview said one of the Disney executives asked him if he could make Avatar but "without the hippy-bullshit", and Cameron said he was going to make his movie his way, or not at all. Seemingly this movie came RIGHT out of the politics of the Cambridge-liberal Matt Damon.

Elysium is Neill Blomkamp's second entry in the Sci-fi genre, following the tremendous success of District 9, which I loved. Now, all the pressure was on Neill Blomkamp to follow up to such a ground- breaking Sci-fi film that'll likely go down as a classic in the near future. Anyways, I hope too many don't mind because I just might go off on a political rant during the review as the film, itself, encourages such discussion- criticism on our way of living and the way we deal with medical care as a whole- because a surprising amount of critics and average movie-goers are panning the film, and a lot of them are blasting its political message, being that our current state of affairs will lead to a world where the poor will be left with no medical coverage or security whilst the privileged (the rich) live on some distant technological land in space where they have instant medical services and, basically, all the resources and attention is focused on such people, which make up a very miniscule portion of the total population, proved by the relatively small size of Elysium (the land occupied by the wealthy) when compared to Earth. Now, I promise I won't be spoiling anything, but the ending has left countless individuals enraged by its implications- most of them being conservative. Actually, I'm pretty sure a lot of people were completely fine with the world and the handling of affairs in the film because they're selfish, ignorant, and simply uninformed. Continuing on, one of the films greatest feats is its cinematography, ranging from the gritty and hopeless look of Earth to the beautiful and paradisiacal look of Elysium. In addition, the film's concept is fairly unfamiliar, and even if some people complain about it being familiar, oddly enough they rate films like The Avengers with a 92%. Elysium isn't all about explosions and pointless clichéd fights; it carries with it a weighty message that will leave concerned and informed individuals thinking about our functionality as a society. Those are the kind of films that should overcrowd the numerous superhero and zombie movies out there. And before someone approaches with the bullshit of it being my opinion, it's really not. It's more of a proper form of filmmaking- strong and memorable storytelling that isn't infested with Hollywood clichés. On top of all that, the cast is great. Matt Damon (Max), as usual, delivers a fine performance as does Sharlto Copley as the film's twisted villain (Kruger). Now, again, if people want to read paragraphs of the premise for the film, then look elsewhere. I hate when stories are spoiled for me, and I don't understand the kind of people who're willing to view 5-minute trailers that explain every single twist and turn in a certain film. Sorry, if you want to hear more about the characters or story and spoil yourself, I'm not going to be doing that in my reviews. What I'll be doing is critiquing the film's overall quality without compromising anything you'd be much better off surprising yourself with. All I'll say is that Earth is facing overpopulation and lack of resources to support its inflammation. Thus, the wealthy relocate themselves up to an open ship (How is this possible? I never understood how.) in space while the rest of the population have no choice but to suffer back on Earth. There is no middle class- you're either rich or poor, and this concept does a great job of presenting us with the potential consequences of the ascending division between the social classes of today. And so, with that being said, Elysium is able to provide the audience with a highly fascinating and believable concept all while presenting spectacular visuals from the futuristic guns and technological equipment to the impressing explosive action, and in that regard, the film does well to balance the drama and the action cleverly instead of overloading its watchers with non-stop, intense, and messy action that spans thirty to forty minutes. Neill Blomkamp trusts his viewers and hopes they possess the intelligence to enjoy such a story instead of desperately longing for setpiece after setpiece of invincible characters pummeling each other. After all has been said and done, Elysium is a breath of fresh air, but it never matches District 9's rare quality. In my book, a masterpiece has to shock you with its superior quality and keep you in your seat from beginning to end, making sure your eyes don't leave the screen. I'm not sure if it was the pacing or my attention span, but Elysium couldn't hook me that way. So, I can't rate it a 5. I just can't. The film's final act transforms into a casual-audience-friendly conclusion after awing us with its enthralling first two acts. As I previously stated, it might feel slightly familiar (according to numerous critics), but it tries hard to stand out from the crowd. At the end of the day, I can say that Elysium is definitely one of the best films of the year so far, and moviegoers would be utterly insane to miss this experience.

Let's first recall a little bit how District 9 became popular despite of its not-entertaining-enough visual effects. I would say it is the unique view angle that the director linked humanity to aliens (so you may only have watched few movies about human turning into aliens). OK, getting back to "Elysium", I would say such a link continues: people on earth struggle to fly to Elysium for a primary reason of healing their diseases. Around such a key contradiction, the plot progresses. As others already pointed out, that is why this movie is "smarter" than many other Sci-Fi. You can imagine these are metaphors but the movie is fluent enough to make you focus on the story itself. Compared to District 9, the director now added something new and interesting in plot: droid, hacker, etc. That is where I love a lot. The director/writer put lots of thoughts in the hacker part of the story and I, as an IT professional in my real life, think it makes sense. For a $100M-budget movie, the graphics part is just decent or probably not that satisfying. I consider it in a way that the director was making new attempts in visual effects but that's eventually not his strength so far. The final battle, where the director set it in a hallway with "cherry-blossom"-like trees around, is more like the director's personal flavor in Japanese ninja style (but not really fascinating to me). The lack of love scene is also worth mentioning :-) Every time Max tried to make emotional communication with Frey, it didn't work out. Think about District 9 again, the dominating male actor is always the kind who puts deep emotion in his heart and appears somehow inhibited (is it a type of good man?) Overall, I still have a high expectation for this young director, Neil Blomkamp's future movies, including an Elysium II. The good thing is I can always see new attempts but the movie would be cooler if the director is more all-round. For this movie, the scene on earth is the way very similar to District 9. Also, interestingly, as a South African- Canadian director, his District 9 was mainly filmed in South Africa while this one was in Vancouver, Canada (it should be the "Elysium" part, while the "earth" part is in Mexico). Therefore, I will be glad to see more fresh visual elements from this director for entertaining audiences better besides good stories and concepts.

It may not be the smash hit that District 9 was, but Elysium still pulls its weight and leaves you to ponder our world relative to Neil Blomkamp's very plausible version of a dystopian Earth for several days following the film. Elysium definitely looks the part, right away you're going to be stunned by the incredible CGI that leaves the universe feeling as clean or as gritty as Blomkamp intended it to be. The contrast between the paradise of Elysium and the destitute servant class on earth is made visually, as well as depicted early and forcefully by interactions with robotic police, working conditions, and quick glimpses into medical care on an overpopulated planet.While it excels visually, Elysium lacks in terms of a story line. We are left with hardly enough time to really get to know Max (Matt Damon)and the plot is very standard action movie fare. The plot also has more holes than swiss cheese, and the magic wand of science fiction is waved over some rather critical components. This rampant outbreak of plot holes and absence of any real character development or resolution leaves you feeling like you've been cheated, and is certainly disappointing coming on the heels of D9, where we were allowed to really identify with the protagonist as he underwent his mutation into an alien. Elysium's real beauty is in it's undeniably relevant social commentary. The film makes an obvious plug for universal health care, but leaves more subtle commentary to the viewer. Elysium exists as a powerful symbol of class division, one that exhibits a shockingly relevant point: all human beings are inextricably connected. Despite the best efforts of the rich to isolate themselves from their economically enslaved servant class, fate would have it otherwise. This isn't to say that anything is better as a result (indeed, there were no indications that the world was operating with unlimited resources) but that the plight of humanity as a whole cannot be lost in a private reality, for eventually it will make itself known.TL DR; Go see Elysium, but be ready to simply drink it in and wait for a few days before you make any strong evaluation of the film. It's a visually stunning, entertaining action film with brilliantly subtle messages.

Storyline is absent. Truly. Of course, if you're OK watching the same "things" over and over with different decorations, you'll get what you seek. Otherwise, it's not even close to be something new and original. However, there still IS a twist in it — the way and sequence those "common" and "predictable" things happen makes the film sort of unique.There's no room for acting. Except for the "Spider" - he was hilarious in terms of looking like a clown and yet being so much important.Beside all that, the atmosphere really takes you into the future. The amount of details showed makes Elysium one of the brightest sci-fi movies I've ever seen. I would truly dive into Neill Blomkamp's year 2154. He made me believe that I was there. So if you're up to have a trip into the world of sci-fi — make sure you watch this. There are moments you won't forget!

Its a known fact-people do not like politics/social commentaries with their action movies. That's the main reason why so many people were harsh on Green Zone. I freaking loved that movie! God, I've never seen so many people jump on the bandwagon for critics nowadays. I blame the Hollywood reporter; ever since his shitty, snobby review hit the web, many people retweeted it and went in with the mind set that they were going to be disappointed. We live in a world where people are so gullible. And maybe the reason why people are saying this movie is disappointing is because Sony decided to make this movie more of an internet campaign. I don't know, but every single one of the people that score this film with a 6/10 or lower, or a B- or lower say they felt the film beat them over the head with its message. Having seen the movie after hearing both sides, those who love it and those who don't like it, i realize that some people are freaking idiots. This movie is a masterpiece; best I've seen this year so far. Its smart, energetic, original, and thrilling. Its far from generic and repetitive that its pundits claim it to be. So lets get down about the positives:1. Matt Damon. Great casting choice! You can really tell the guy put a lot into his character, and you felt that he was a real person and that made his character more relatable. You really want to root for this guy in his quest to take down Elysium. 2. The world of 2154. You can tell that Neil Blomkamp has put so much effort into the world of this dystopian future. Nothing is clean and all pretty like a lot of futuristic movies; no Earth is an over-populated waste land, full of people dying and looking up at a world that orbits there's, wishing for a way out. This is a world you can sink into, and a lot of people felt that it was just a huge social message slapping them in the face- (immigration and health care) But the film really doesn't yeah the symbolism is there but its not in your face. Only hard core conservatives are saying that this movie is a huge political porno. 3. Special effects-not one moment in this movie did i think any of the things were CGI. Much like Pacific Rim that came out last month, the special effects are mind blowing. And what's better is the use of practical effects; there is a lot of it in this movie and that boosts the realism of the film even more. The droids, the world of Elysium, all look visually spectacular. 4. Kruger. Okay, I saved the best for last. This is with out a doubt the best part of the film and you will hear this from nearly everybody. Shartlo Copely completely steals the show. In a great movie, he is the greatest; he stands out over his counter parts as the menacing, electrifying, creepy, and crazy Kruger. We don't see a WHOLE lot of kruger, but when we do, its awesome. Shartlo puts so much into his performance, giving us the joker vibe. There is a scene towards the end of this film were I was watching Kruger and legitimately felt he was a futuristic heath ledger joker without make up. He will go down as one of the best villains in history. I really didn't have any really issues with the movie except one, but its not like it brings down the entire experience.1. Jodie Foster. The moment I heard she was in this movie and saw her in the trailer, I knew that she was going to play a role that any woman her age could play...and i was not wrong. Even though she is able to get the whole corrupt politician down, her presence doesn't feel as important as Damon's and Copely's. She does a good job, but not great; she's the weakest link in the film for sure but doesn't bring down the movie.In the end, I loved Elysium, and I think there's another reason why people are feeling disappointed-they win expecting District 9. And they should not have done that at all. I went in expecting an entertaining conventional, original sci-fi movie and that's exactly what I got. I didn't go in expecting an original mockumentary/sci-fi thriller. That's like going into a transformers movie expecting a strong, clever story with deep characters and heavy emotion. Change your expectations people. Seriously. 10/10

Alternate title... "How I learned to Stop Worrying and Wait for Matt Damon to Send Down the Obamacare-Bots from Space".In "Elysium", Neill Blomkamp unleashes a bold, shocking vision of a world, 150 years in the future, where most of Los Angeles speaks Spanish, the world's snootiest people speak French, and alarm clocks jolt the working class awake with annoying, poorly synthesized voices...Actually, the most shocking thing in this movie is that the future still contains GMC pickups (presumably after 14 more government bailouts). OK, so M. Night Shyamalan's directorial gimmick was the surprise ending, featuring clues brought to you by the color red, in a movie where almost nothing else happens. Apparently Mr. Blomkamp's signature style consists of thinly veiled social commentary pummeled into your (sub)conscious mind by lots of really bad-ass explosions. But even M. Night didn't squander the goodwill generated by a strong feature film debut this quickly.But since enough has already been written - or surely will be - about Elysium's not-so-hidden agenda, I'll just focus on what a truly derivative, grade-C science fiction movie it is.But first a question. Why did the native South Africans in Johannesburg have subtitles for their English in "District 9" but Sharlto Copley didn't have subtitles for his English in "Elysium"?!? The guy was totally indecipherable. Don't make me say the R-word! OK, I'll say it: Ripoff! Yeah, that's right, Bane was first to make it cool to be a mushmouthed uber-villain, and he did it better. At least I could tell that Bane had something interesting to say, even if I still don't know to this day what it was. Here are some random musings about "Elysium": I enjoyed the melodramatic overacting by the hacker king, though he could have used subtitles also. It was fun to see him determine that Matt Damon's head contained the secrets to rigging the presidency, not to mention unleashing universal health care, just by looking at a hexadecimal code dump for all of 5 seconds. I totally didn't expect that. I felt bad for Matt Damon's character (I forgot his name already, as I will the rest of the movie in a few more hours) when he got exposed to an accidental overdose of gamma radiation. But at least he didn't walk around pantsless the rest of the movie like Dr. Manhattan in "Watchmen" (just shirtless). Did they ever explain why the robots were exposed to lethal doses of radiation during manufacturing? It certainly didn't make them any better as marksmen. They couldn't even keep William Fichtner's sweet Bugatti from getting jacked.I laughed at the scene where Matt got turned into a cyborg. It was straight out of MTV's new reality show, "Pimp My Exoskeleton". With street-smart docs like that, who needs the magic MRIs on Elysium? Oh, I remember Matt's character's name now: it's Max. They only screamed it about two hundred times in one hour and forty minutes. Sorry, that's a gross exaggeration, just like everything else in this movie. Why would the ultra-elite of the future want to confine themselves to an orbiting space station that has less square footage than Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch, Steve Jobs' iYacht, and Mitt Romney's car-rooftop dog carrier combined? Don't they know that one out of every three "undocumented" shuttles gets past Elysium's land-based defense grid, which consists primarily of a mentally unstable epic beard man with a van full of space-Stingers? Then again, that success rate does make Elysium more secure than the U.S. border. Yes, the robot and rocket-ship effects look very realistic, but the flying vehicles are kind of boring to look at, like the shuttles in "Star Trek". If the director wanted to do futuristic military aircraft right, he should have gone back 27 years and looked at the drop ship in Jim Cameron's "Aliens". That thing really looked like a futuristic Apache/Harrier hybrid, not just some boxcar with thrusters bolted on the corners.Wait, so one minute you can have your head totally reconstructed, beard and all, after taking a grenade to the face, but the next minute you can't be cured from having your brainwaves downloaded to a USB thumb drive? I guess the data in Matt Damon's head was considered a pre-existing condition. In the end, I think Elysium fails just because it is so clichéd, unoriginal, and inconsistent with its own vision, not because of its blatant socio-political message. It's also a huge letdown after "District 9". By the way, I have nothing against speaking Spanish - lots of my favorite people do it, and most of them speak my language better than I speak theirs (Shakira, por ejemplo). I wish I had more time to study Spanish but I'm too busy writing this review. In fact, the only level on which Elysium succeeds is as a nice introduction to the Spanish language, which is why I'm giving it two extra stars. At around $10 a ticket, it's a lot cheaper than Rosetta Stone.

Like the extremely overrated District 9, Elysium's lone strength is its convincing special effects and its weaknesses are in every other area. Although there is nothing as terribly stupid as the District 9 "alien blood that can bond with human DNA ... and also power spaceships," Elysium is heavy handed allegory, amped up drama and dramatically ridiculous.Some of the ships and robots are great to look at---seeing Syd Mead's name in the credits was not a big surprise.Since the days of Hitchcock people seemed to have forgotten that the first and most important job of a director is not to come up with 'cool visuals,' but direct actors. Ergo, the title, 'director.' So congrats to Blomkamp for showing me the first truly terrible Jodie Foster performance. It's like he showed her a 1960s spider-man cartoon and said, 'like this but bigger.' And a lot of her work was dubbed for some reason, likely accent inconsistency (even though it's still inconsistent in the end product). And i am a HUGE William Fichtner fan, but this movie also showcases his career nadir. Sometimes he seems to be imitating Data from Star Trek, other times, sort of German. And Copley as the villain...well if there is a less menacing accent than this, i haven't heard it. And he is of course, way, way over the top as he was in District 9 (though he was decent in Europa Report). Damon is the only performer whose work is credible, probably because he's a big enough star to just say no if Blomkamp wants to turn him into a screaming cartoon.In terms of story, don't expect any science or anything other than good versus evil. Sadly, with rare exception, Hollywood science fiction movies are really just noisy action movies these days, and as a huge science fiction fan I know i'll rarely see any interesting scientific elements in these (though the movies of Duncan Jones and Kosinski do have some smart ideas and are the exceptions). So no, Elysium isn't sci-fi, but just heavy handed action movie allegory, more or less the same class warfare of District 9, so he's already retreading this theme. Then there is the would-be action centerpiece exo-skeletal suit, an idea that doesn't work at all, and isn't well sold visually. Really, as designed, this thing wouldn't work without tearing off fingers and smashing the limbs of its user, which is why most exo-skeletal designs are also armor that could shield a water-based lifeform. In any case, the actions scenes are so shaky and over cut, it's hard to see what's happening regardless. But I never had even a moment of thinking the thing actually functioned or would function.Blomkamp clearly has a political viewpoint---one that I have no issue with at all, except that it makes his writing too pedantic and monochromatic. A strong viewpoint does not make one a good writer. Writing rich people are bad and poor people are good is not dramatically compelling to watch, even if you actually believe things are that simple. Look at the success George RR Martin is having with complex characters...Blomkamp's writing seems like that of a child by comparison. That Elysium is self-important and humorless, doesn't help.And if Blomkamp (who clearly should not write his own movies) really understood science fiction the way actual science fiction writers do---guys like Greg Egan, JMS, Ted Chiang, Arthur C. Clarke, Greg Bear, M. John Harrison, Stephen Baxter, Larry Niven, etc.--- he would not have a future world technology where humans can be rebuilt at an atomic level in the same world as one in which robots fire guns and miss their targets. (!!!) Robots hitting their targets when they fire is near future and to some extent, current; rebuilding bodies at an atomic level (in less than a minute) is very, very, very far future, if ever. But like most Hollywood junk---and the similarly stupid, crazily overrated breakthrough success District 9--- Blomkamp is doing something that looks like science fiction, but isn't.

Neill Blomkamp (District 9) is a good writer director with a near-mastery of set design and CGI. If he could learn to take his lead-foot off the "social allegory" pedal he could be superb. But that is not likely to happen anytime soon, because Bloomkamp is clearly attracted to the Moral Pulpit like a moth to the flame. Not that this is a bad thing. At a time when Hollywood does not know whether it is coming or going (literally -- if you haven't been paying attention, Tinseltown product is now being released in Russia before it ever gets to Cleveland) it is refreshing indeed to encounter a film as finely crafted as Elysium. So well crafted indeed that Bloomkamp has unintentionally made it remarkably easy for his audience to ignore most (if not all) of the preaching and simply enjoy one of the most fluid sci-fi actioners since Alien. That's how good this guy is. As much as he would love to get each viewer alone for 6 hours and explain precisely what is wrong with our world - DUH -- he simply cannot resist the temptation to be an entertainer first, and a cleric second. Highly recommended. And for those with lingering doubts, a newly "buffed" Matt Damon has become the new Kurt Russell and a genuine Action Figure. IRONY ALERT: Damon could not be cajoled into doing the last Bourne but his role here is little more than Bourne Redux. Ditto for Jodie Foster, who turned up her nose at the last Hannibal, but here gives a performance that is little more than a placeholder for action to come.

Just Saw this Film at an advanced screening in Long Beach.Battle: Los Angeles is the tale of Staff Sargeant Nantz' last day as a marine. Without spelling it out or drawing a diagram, the audience and the marine platoon we are following, are immediately deployed into Los Angeles for reasons they do not know. Soon we learn that indeed Aliens are landing off the shore of LA and killing everyone on the beach. The platoon we are following is sent on a mission to get some survivors from a gas station several miles from the coast. Generic movie ensues.The film is shot like Bourne with epilepsy. I'm 21 years old and not too old to follow the action on screen, its just really, really, annoying when 80% of the shots are extremely herky jerky close-ups. There is not a single steady shot in the entire film. Not one. The intensity of the effect wears off right after the first alien is killed. After that the movie spiralled downhill deep, deep into the realm of the cliché. I'm going to name a few character's roles that are in this film, see if you can recognize them from other films you've seen. Experienced, hardened leader who gets a new platoon. Young officer straight out of officer's school who can't handle the action. Bad ass chick who can shoot. Soft and sweet nurse who gets picked up along the way. An Asian guy, a black guy, a white dude from the south, and a rookie make up the main part of the platoon. There is a scene where tension is high and its just a damn dog making noise. Start to see where this is going? This movie had some good things going for it. Its use of silence was well done. The blasting boom of the gunshots were startlingly realistic. The alien spacecrafts are awesome. The aliens themselves are pretty cool. Its just that the screenplay is terrible. SOOOOOO cliché in every way. This is your standard war movie just with Aliens. The ending is just as cliché as the rest of the film. Don't fool yourself into thinking it will actually be difficult to beat the aliens. 0 thought involved.Hopefully Mr. Liebesman has better luck with the final product of Clash 2 than he did with this. Everyone I saw the movie with thought it was pretty bad. Movies like this that I totally enjoyed: District 9, Cloverfield, Avatar (somewhat), City of God (cinematography) and Blackhawk Down. All much, much better than this.District 9 and the Bourne Identity had a really stupid baby.

I would like to say that this movie lives up to you're expectations if you are expecting the right things. This is an alien invasion movie so you must remember that throughout the movie. It is similar to Skyline but better and on that note Skyline was not a bad movie. When I go to see a movie like this I expect big booms and big aliens and that is what you get from this movie. I rate it an 8 out of 10 for alien invasion style movies. They all cant be Independence Day! The story line is a little tired but what else is there really to talk about in a story like this. From the military aspect of it they show some nice weaponry which is always a plus. The aliens are pretty well done too. The film is a little jerky but who wants to watch still frames the whole time, you may as well watch a slide show if thats what you want. Well done!

Just Saw this films about 3 Hours ago at MCAS Miramar...just imagine how great this sounds... Independence day + call of duty = Battle LA. There's no way the can mess this up right?... wrong. I was extremely excited about this film, I was following all the trailers, the viral marketing but the end result was rather disappointing.Aaron Eckhart, Michelle Rodriguez did a great job, but the supporting cast was sub par, and the dialogue was crap. The camera work was as shacky as this directors career... seriously, who would hire the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Beginning, B rated director to direct a 100 million dollar project... who's running this studio? if this studio is this desperate for ideas/advice then they should hire me...well lets get back on track...Plot summarized: (1)Marines Deploy after the Aliens invade(2) Marines ordered to save cops/civilians at the police station (2) Marines save some civilians (3) The Marines decide to hot wire a bus(really?)during a alien assault (4) they all board a bus and head to base(5) They make it to base after a serious of events and find it in ruins (just like in ID4) (6) The team decides to head for the secondary extraction zone and Blah, Blah, Blah... - sorry, i got better things to do on Friday night...Battle LA is not a bad movie, Its entertaining and fun to watch but it falls flat rather quickly.Posted on my facebook - "felt like i was watching a recruiting commercial" *** /out of 5I got to hand it to Aaron Eckhart... That rifle to pistol transition, during that Alien retreat was good! Ooh-Rah

I went into this movie expecting something good. This was supposed to be skyline with a budget. Well..... it was just that. The story however didn't get improved much. The story line is as follows. Meteors heading towards earth...... they crash into ocean near major cites all over world..... aliens emerge and start killing everything in sight...... marines sent in to evacuate before air strike....... blah blah blah you get the general idea. The fighting scenes were OK the effects were decent but they really messed up the story. We are told that the aliens are obviously here for our resources and they are here to wipe us out or colonize us or something. Then we find out the aliens are just really here for our water which for some reason seems to power everything for them. >_>; So it would seem the aliens run on water and the ships that are all unmanned for some reason also run on water...... so rather than just covertly take the water they came up on land and just started to take over..... halfway through they capture a semi live alien to figure out how to kill it.... they cut it open and pull it apart and find what appears to be a heart and viola! All we have to do to beat these things is to cut them open and stab the heart.... oh wait we cant do that.... some of the other problems I had were time errors.... one scene they are in the middle of the day then later they are being evacuated by copter at night. After 15 mins of walking through the sewer they emerge and TADA its the middle of the afternoon. I would say you should go see it to say you saw it but that is all.

It doesn't matter whether you arrive late at the cinema or you need to leave the cinema before the movie ends because there is no plot, and it looks just all the same throughout the 2 hours: A small team of soldiers plus a small team of aliens playing hide and seek in a battlefield. Minimal change in setting, sound and there is a lock of story development. Perhaps the only good thing about the movie is it successfully differentiates itself from the normal sci-fi alien movie i.e. no super-powerful alien forces that can wipe-out everything in seconds. So the beauty is the touch of realism, that allows human soldiers to fight with guns and bombs whilst the aliens fight with weapon of similar level of power. Yet, this plain fight lasts for 2 hours!

Battle: Los Angeles (or Enemy Invasion in EU countries) is a pretty neat example of what you'll get if you combine camera style of "Cloverfield", basic plot of "The Independence Day" and the atmosphere of "Black Hawk Down" together. That would be it for most people if only the target audience wasn't familiar with video games and haven't recognized many influences mostly from Killzone and Crysis franchises. I'm not saying it's a bad thing - definitely something to make the movie more visible in the amounts of action flicks made these days. And probably the first one to get it right how to mix video games with movies - those familiar with those franchises will enjoy it even more, those who are not will never notice since those influences are not so explicitly shown throughout the movie. Even though somewhat cheesy, Battle: LA is one hell of an enjoyable ride. Especially for fans of Killzone, Crysis, Quake and, what the heck, even Gears of War and Halo. Jonathan Libesman never made any really noticeable movie but something tells me he's gonna make it with this one. 8 out of 10.

Wow...Now it's been a long time since I said that when it comes to a movie. Or anything really. But I'll say it again. Wow! Battle: Los Angeles looked fantastic from it's electrifying TV spots and Trailers but who knew it would actually live up to the intensity I hoped for. And it does and it's so much than I could have hoped for. The film is simplistic in concept we get invaded this is the story of the marine platoon who discovers a weakness in the deadly E.T. force turning the war back into our favor. There's a little bit of back story thrown in at the beginning so we get a gist of each individual. But when the action starts it doesn't stop and it is intense. Don't think this is Transformers or even Independence Day for that matter this is a new beast borrowing from 80's classics like Aliens and Predator and adding in the realism of Paranormal Activity if you will. The movie is so intense, it's a little corny in parts but emotionally engaging nonetheless, it's terrifying in parts, even a little disturbing but most of all it's just a great time at the movies a big buttery, salty popcorn flick. The film doesn't aim for depth and even though it offers glimpses of a different film it doesn't veer away from it's true intention. Which is to entertain the crap out of you. And it does. I laughed, I cried, I sweated and I cheered, in fact everyone did when the movie ended. Battle Los Angeles is truly an electrifying roller coaster ride of a film. And it owes it all too Johnathan Liebesman director of the somewhat promising but silly Darkness Falls and the grim but rawly dread drenched Texas Chainsaw Massacre: the beginning. he brings those elements here with a little sprinkle of when Michael Bay made good films. Sure the acting isn't spot on all the time and the major problem to be honest is the screenplay with some truly insipid dialog. But the film is beautifully done, with great creative cinematography and sound effects that will blow you away and some surprisingly involving performances especially from Aaron Eckheart and Bridget Moynahan. And being a gay man I must say I came across a new crush Gino Anthony Nesi he's so gorgeous and I hope to see much more of him in movies to come. All in all a super, great entertaining film the best film of it's kind in the last twenty years.

I'd give this movie a 6-7 stars out of 10. This movie wasn't the best, it's like any other "alien movie": 1.Aliens come, and destroy everything 2.There's no hope except for these few people who fight till the end 3.People die there's drama etc.. 4.After all that they find hope and then they destroy the aliens .. 5.A few people live and they're considered as the "heroes"That's how it goes ... very predictable ... the graphics weren't great at all considering were in 2011 !! Even though it was predictable the actors,the few jokes her and there made this movie a lot better then expected.(I actually cling ed when the characters were in a "pickle" ... lol Overall this movie was OK... not the best .... it had potential but the directors didn't take full advantage of that because they knew this plot was like any other "alien movie" plot.

The time is today (well, a few months away, to be exact) and the macro background is rendered intentionally vague. What the alien invaders really are is absolutely inconsequential. They are enemies and must be defeated – their lives or ours, period. Yes, there is one scene in which US marines and a civilian vet plunge their hands into the open torso of a dying alien (it's hard to tell whether it's front or back), ransacking, pulling out an assortment of slimy objects, trying to find a vital organ. The outcome of this unintentionally (or maybe intentionally, I don't know) comical scene is a simple, sweet conclusion: their heart is on their right side – to kill, shoot right. You see my point.The focus of the movie is micro – a group of marines fighting their way out of a battered area of L.A. to bring out some rescued civilians, and later to destroy a vital communication centre of the enemy's that they stumbled across. As I inferred in the summary line, the fighting is quite conventional, artillery-based, state-of-the-art hardware notwithstanding. As such, this movie is well crafted and filmed and would satisfy most hard-core traditional war movie fans. Part and parcel of the package is of course the emotion contents: personality conflict, heroism, cliff-hangers, casualties, sacrifices, poignancy – all very familiar and predictable. At the end of the day, observing the length Hollywood has gone to boost the morale of the US marine, you would almost believe that they got tipped off by the government that a major campaign is about to be launched.The cast is strong for a movie of this genre. Aaron Eckhart, one of the most under-recognized actors in Hollywood, leads the cast as well as the US marines in the story. Bridget Moynahan, who once played Isaac Asimov's legendary Susan Calvin (in her young days) opposite Will Smith in "I, Robot" (2004), is underused here as the civilian vet referred to earlier. Also underused, in a different way, is Michelle Rodriguez, one of the best tough-chick actors around today, not getting as much action as you would like to see her get. Thrown into the movie for good measure is Michael Pena (remember his collaboration with Nicholas Cage in "World Trade Centre" (2006) as the two trapped firemen?) playing a small role as a civilian with a family and winding up as collateral damage.

I went to the midnight opening with two buddies... I should have gone to bed! This is essentially just a more gritty remake of Independence Day, with a bit of Blackhawk Down mixed in. Unfortunately, it's FAR more ID4 than BD, and doesn't even have Will Smith to distract you from the plot and dialogue.The MTV Camera-Work worked better for this movie than many, but it may cause seizures if you're prone to such things.Don't even get me started on the strategy & tactics of the aliens - The Mobile Infantry from Starship Troopers had a better battle plan! The CGI & battle scenes are very good, but get lost in a plot driven by 'hoo-rah' cliché'. And while they do try to poke fun at themselves at one point by referencing John Wayne, even that falls flat and just seems silly in context. If you can check your brain at the door, it's not a complete waste of two hours.

War movies depicting a group of soldiers against overwhelming odds are nothing new. For generations, moviegoers have been treated to cinematic recreations as well as new scenarios of fighting units in combat. Usually these films follow a typical formula that includes the tough and gritty commanding officer, the naive new soldier, the one with a woman and children waiting at home, and one who has difficulties with combat. In the new movie Battle: Los Angeles a new twist is given to the formulaic troops-in-combat picture which produces a mixed bag of results.Aaron Eckhart stars as Staff Sgt. Michael Nantz; a 20 year Marine who, after losing men on a recent mission, has decided that it is time for him to leave and has filed his retirement paperwork from the corps. While completing a training exercise, Nantz and a squadron of Marines at Camp Pendleton are activated for what they are told is an evacuation mission in order to clear Santa Monica and other area residents from a swarm of meteors which are scheduled to hit just off the coast.Nantz is assigned to a new commanding officer who, like the men in his unit, is wary of Nantz as many believe that he got his men killed in his last assignment. Despite the misgivings of the new lieutenant, he agrees that Nantz offers a wealth of experience and should be just fine for a simple evacuation assignment.However during the mission briefing, the Marines are informed that the meteors that are hitting off the coast of major cities around the world contain metallic centers and that this is very likely an invasion from an unknown force. While the Marines are deploying an otherworldly fighting unit emerges destroying everything in their path as they moved inland from the coast line. Unsure what they are dealing with, the military decides to carpet bomb the city in order to contain the alien threat and give Nantz and his unit three hours to enter the combat zone and evacuate civilians from a police station.While the movie is for the most part the standard soldiers-at-war film which substitute's aliens for the usual enemy forces, the strength of the cast and the solid action and special effects help the movie overcome many of its shortcomings. There is little character development in the film and scenarios that were introduced in some of the characters' back stories early in the film were given little to no chance to develop once the shooting started.I also had an issue with some of the tactics in the film. While it may seem nitpicking there were a few scenes where the soldiers didn't follow logical courses of engagement until later in the film. I have had only the most basic of combat instruction from my brief time in the Air Force, yet I can think of at least four scenarios in the film where the unit failed to use the most logical options available in their combat situation. Of course any film dealing with an alien invasion is sure to have plot holes and yes I can quibble about the Air Force waiting three hours to bomb a heavily overrun area when containment would have been priority one in not allowing a hostile force that much time to entrench itself.That being said it was an interesting and entertaining film. The enemy was sufficiently mysterious and dangerous enough to hold my interest and had me rooting desperately for the troops to rise up and strike back at the enemy. Michelle Rodriguez does fine supporting work in the role of an Air Force Tech Sgt. who may have the key to turning the tide of the battle. Eckhart is solid as the gruff but caring staff sergeant is equally strong and his unit of young corporals, including R&B singer Ne-Yo, are believable.Director Jonathan Liebesman knows the core intention of this film is and in doing so provides enough action to keep the audience entertained throughout. despite some issues with pacing and plot. While it doesn't have the epic feel of Independence Day, Battle: Los Angeles is a film that provides enough entertainment to make it one of the better alien invasion films ever made and one that I certainly would not mind seeing revisited in a future sequel.3.5 stars out of 5

Well i hope all of you are ready for one hell of an alien packed year. Ever since the release of "District 9" two years ago, almost every studio was looking for the next 'Alien Invasion' type flick. Well, that and the fact that every single movie about aliens invading seems to near triple it's budget. But this is the first of many alien type films to be released this year. Hopefully it starts with a bang.Well, since i already mentioned this movie, lets go ahead and use "District 9" as an example. You know how that movie had tons of character development and created such an elaborate plot......well, it's almost as if this movie took that idea, and did the exact opposite. For starters, the plot is just plain terrible. They never really fully establish why the aliens are here, or where they came from. Throughout the movie, they just give you little half cooked theories that come across TV screens as the main characters run through ruined city streets. I'm sorry, but when dealing with creatures from outer space, you kind of need that attention to detail. You can't just ride on the idea that 'They are from outer space, enough said'. "Skyline" did the same exact approach, and look how terrible that turned out. As an audience, we loved to be overwhelmed with information and concepts about alien species.......hell, thats why everyone goes to see em'.Another bad aspect of this film is the character development and dialog. Honestly, about 90 minutes into this picture, i came to realization that i still did not know any of the characters names, nor did i really want to, because each character produced zero stage presence. And i blame that not only on the cheesy cliché' filled dialog, but the producers and the directors for not realizing that they just read a script that zero character substance.But the worst portion of this film, is hands down the shaky camera work. I really have never complained about this until now. I like the hand-held aspect, i really do. But from beginning to end, there was not one still frame in the entire movie. Even when it was just two people talking in a quiet room, the camera moved around like a drunken Irishman was controlling it. Seriously, "The Blair Witch Project" had more still framed shots than this. You would figure a 100 million dollar movie would have a couple of tripods lying around. But what made this aspect really bad, was the fact that you never really got a clear view of the aliens. I mean, they even cut one up into pieces to find it's weak spot, and you still don't even know what they look like. I got a better view of the aliens at the end of "Close Encounters", and they are only in the movie for about 5 minutes. This movie is almost 2 hours long, and i can't even really tell you what they looked like.Bottom Line, the only thing i can give this movie a compliment on is the action. Which is just okay if you ask me. Everything else stinks to high heaven. It's just an empty alien invasion movie. Even if you go in with the mentality that it's like "Cloverfield".....you know, the fact that you only know as much as the main characters. You'll still leave pretty disappointed.

A movie for the "Call of Duty" generation where the sound and special effects take the center stage while drama and emotions take the back stage. So it is quite okay to assume that the story and all the other associated aspects will play a minimal role. With that in mind this movie is a great spectacle! Though at times it is like an assault on the ears and the eyes.The movie makes it clear right from the start that it is not going to be the one that feeds with the answers for the happenings in the story. And also with the constant comings and goings of different characters it is also evident that the story-writer and the director never had the intention to develop their characters nor was there space to include a lot of cliché sequences.Performance-wise Aaron Eckart has put in a decent effort. The rest are all the usual characters that can be seen in several of the other movies of the same genre. What makes this movie different is that the humans are capable to hold on to the invasion and the aliens are not all that powerful but they are smart in some ways.With this movie there will be two factions that will come up. One who will be hardcore fans this movie and the old-schoolers who will rant endlessly about the lack of a solid script, stupid characters and below average special effects. Yes am talking about none other than the greatest critic alive on this earth now...Mr Roger Ebert. Mr. Ebert you are a guy who used to write scripts for semi-snuff films for Russ Meyer. And of all the people you complain about a stupid story for such a movie. Old man if you cannot handle all the noise and mayhem on the screen better sit back at your place and please do some thumb-sucking! Period!OK now this does not mean that I belong to the former group that I mentioned in the previous para. I am creating a new platform between the two distinctions. I stand on neutral grounds. I enjoyed the movie for what it was and I loathed the movie for the lack of emotional quotient which could have raised the stakes for this one.All in all ...a decent flick where you go in leaving behind everything...your brain, your heart and head outside the cinemas. Just take in our eyes and your ears.It is a "Call of Duty" game without a controller to hold in you hand!PS: About the Ebert blast. That is my own personal one-sided vendetta.

Wendy Murphy: "Oh, Honey, ever since you were a little baby, I knew... you would save the world from an alien invasion." Monsters vs. Aliens(2009) It's the first time I have witnessed a vehicle going 6 miles on LA's Expressway 10 in less than 2 hours. Of course, it's in a Humvee that crushes stopped cars, but then this is sci-fi and the movie is Battle: Los Angeles, a fusion of Terminator, Transformer, and Blackhawk Down in the video-game mode where the enemy is just dense enough to be in your line of sight most of the time.Aliens are invading earth, it seems, for its resources, most notably its water supply. Aaron Eckhart is SSgt. Michael Nantz of a new Marine platoon fighting aliens, who for some inexplicable reason want LA, which is the last of earth's great cities to fall. Nantz gets a chance to prove he's not the coward legend has him to be for losing men in a previous conflict, and the rest of his platoon, diverse for sure, get too-brief moments to show their humanity. It's all pretty standard stuff for war and sci-fi.The action is relentless, mostly guns and grenades deployed around corners and inside buildings as in Blackhawk Down. The alien warriors have a Transformer look: awkward Erector-Set bodies vulnerable despite their menacing look. Their mother ship is a hodgepodge of sharp angles and gangly protrusions, more like the work of a mad inventor than the ship that brought them from multiple light years away.Although it may seem to be boilerplate sci-fi, it does suggest our own rapacious activities with underdeveloped, resource-rich emerging nations and our fear of home-grown aliens. But I'm stretching it—Battle: Los Angeles is for geeks and video fanatics. Lamentably, even after the attack, which destroys most cars in the city, the freeways are still clogged.

i watched Battle: Los Angeles today with my friends.i found it very boring and irritating.how could any one make a movie which is flawed in every way.There is no storyline,no screenplay and disturbed way of cinematography.From the beginning to the end,there is only gun firing and dialogs which are useless in every sense.i almost slept in between the movie. "independence day"was much more better than this futile creation. we wonder why these aliens destroying the cities and killing the people.We wont be able to know the character's name because of the screaming.Director Jonathan Liebesman made a huge mistake by making this crappy movie.so people stay out of this movie..go and watch it in theaters only u are mentally retarded...

film of the year for me so far, independence day, district 9, skyline, black hawk down and some others all collide, amazing effects and a moderate storyline, needs a sequel, the only problem with the film is that it still seems slightly original and doesn't really expand on that, still, its a fantastic to watch, cant wait until September when the DVD and blu ray comes out. a lot of people were in and seemed happy with it, and why not? this film is dazzling in sound and visuals and the aliens look cool, the ships too are fantastic, the chemistry is amazing between the cast and seems realistic, with a bit of humour. overall i don't care about what magazines and newspapers and some sites, this film deserves more credit.

I love action movies and really look forward to watching a good sci-fi flick every time. The trailers really boasted what seemed to be a worthy watch. So I went to the theatre with an open mind, expecting nothing more than dumb action, FX and gun shooting. What I found was so bad that it qualifies as one of the worst movies that I'll never see again. The classic yankee clichés are there... truly sickening at times. The Sergeant's backstory about having lost soldiers under his command... The resentful brother of one of the killed soldiers being in the same group... The discovering of gunpowder when they figure out that the big alien command ship is the key to winning the battle... The "we're communicating everyone on how to beat the aliens as we speak..." (saw that in Independence Day already). The Sergeant reciting his lost soldiers ID numbers (Sgt. Brockovich?), which made me laugh because of the corniness of it all. Apart of all this, the way they discover how to kill the aliens was just straight up laughable... I don't know if they found his weak spot or if the alien just died of the torture of having the Sergeant stabbing away at him. No intention of being mean with Eckhart, but his role is so weak that it's just hard to take him serious from now on. People, specially young men, others, not me, tend to justify action flicks by saying that you shouldn't expect more out of them... the thing is, when you drop your demands so much you're very liable to get movies like these, just full of nonsense and absolutely forgettable. Why was Michelle Rodriguez cast? Did she add to the plot in any way? This is more a US Marines drafting flick than a movie....

Battle: Los Angeles is a cross between Cloverfield (hand-held camera) and Independence Day (aliens landing on earth). It stars Aaron Eckhart as Staff Seargant Michael Nantz who having lost his platoon on a previous assignment files paperwork to leave active service for a while, but a call that meteors are landing all around the globe, which turns out to be aliens throws him back into the mix. The aliens want to eradicate the human colony for the resources of water, which helps in some way (it's never properly explained) to power their ships and mechanical bodies. Nantz becomes part of a new platoon who includes second lieutenant William Martinez (Ramon Rodrigeuz), Cpl. Jason Lockett (Cory Hardict), Cpl. Nick Stavrou (Gino Anthony Pesci), Cpl. Kevin Harris (Ne-yo surprisingly, whom I didn't even recognise until his name flashed up on the credits!) and TSgt Elena Santos (Michelle Rodriguez). They go to rescue any civilians in Santa Monica who are trapped in a police station and escort them out where also they find where the command module of the aliens ships that controls everything is and try to destroy it.That's it really, and what is part of my criticism the story is very basic with no real twists, which also does contain some plot holes. Also there is no characterisation for any of the main characters who are as thin as cardboard, the film follows the usual formulaic structure with every stereotype you could imagine with the types of characters involved like "the new guy who wants to impress," and "the guy put in charge of a new platoon after losing his old one" etc. The script as well is truly dreadful, with all the clichés and cheesiness you could expect. But the thing is I was expecting this as this is your typical "America saves the world" trashy film.I also expected other things that would be positive for this movie and it delivered. The action was exciting and well choreographed, (the best action sequence being on a freeway whilst the platoon try to save the civilians), there was enough suspense and tension throughout added by the great music and general pace of the film, the special effects of the aliens and their ships was impressive, the acting was surprisingly good even with the awful script. Aaron Erckart convinced as a marine leader with Michelle Rodriguez and Cory Hardict delivering solid supporting performances. The biggest strength I would say though is that it was excellently shot and edited. The hand-held camera added to the authenticity of the situation and never was too shaky, though there were a few scenes where it was hard to make sense of what was happening, but generally it was perfect. Not everyone will like this film, those expecting anything then what I resembled of a decent script and story will be sorely disappointed and even the hand-held camera as pointed out by certain reviewers on here will irritate some people who may complain it's hard to see anything and that would be right in some respects. Battle: Los Angeles wasn't perfect with a story we've all seen so many times before, but if your looking for good action, special effects and reasonable acting, it does deliver. For me I would normally have given this film a five or six out of ten, but the acting and camera-work was a bonus and enough to tip it into a seven. Also there were more positives for this movie than negatives, which worked in the film's favour. Enjoyable action adventure that delivers solidly. A great effort.

I love my share of summer popcorn blockbusters...I really do. I mean, half of the time, I go more for the special effects and explosions more than character development and acting. But hey, if the film adds those two in, you get amazing films like the new Star Trek and Cloverfield.But that's not what you get with Battle: Los Angeles. You don't even get a summer blockbuster. Instead you get a ridiculous plot, stale acting, and not even a really interesting war film.I understand what the director wanted to do. He wanted to make a film of what it would really be like if aliens were to invade earth using a more military warfare theme than science fiction. The aliens put all their technology into traveling light years to get to earth and no so much their weapons. When they arrive, they are firing ballistic weapons much like the humans are. they don't have some advanced defense system either. They just seem to human to have gotten here in the first place.And then you have our guys, a group of military folks, who spend a good amount of the movie vaguely revealing their story line, but never to the point where you actually care about them. Expecting dad here, mourning brother there, but no one that is beyond the caricature. This group spends a good majority of the film trying to get to a group of civilians and get them to safety...and that's about it. Sure, the scenery changes a bit and you get to see the scope of the damage, but after a while, burning cities and dead bodies get old. And because there is no vested interest in the characters themselves, it's really waiting around for everyone to die or for the humans to find some way to best this "advanced" race of species.Battle: Los Angeles benefits from a truly amazing trailer. Kind of like the teaser for Skyline. Great trailer, horrible film.

Watched 'Battle: Los Angeles' earlier today and enjoyed the film. The film has been given the tag "'Independence Day' meets 'Black Hawk Down'". Actually, I would describe it as... "These are the bits you didn't see in the film 'Signs'"(difference in water plot aside). OK, bad bits out the way. There is cheesy dialogue in parts and yes, sometimes you think you may be watching a US Marines recruitment video especially as the air-force, coastguard, army, and the rest of the world are unable to effectively strike back at the enemy. And OK yes, you know what is going to happen in the end (but I was routing for that anyway). And OK,I was racking my brain for the first 20 minutes before I realised that 2nd Lieutenant Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez) was that annoying person from Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Good bits, it is a fantastic roller coaster ride of action from start to finish and there is enough character building (ok, not a great deal... but enough) to make you care what happens to some of these characters. I also liked the film's premise of how we would respond to the early days of an 'alien' invasion (not very well). There are also obvious parallels drawn on the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, which I liked, especially with the street fighting sequences which are well executed. Aaron Eckhart is a fine actor and puts in a solid performance as a battle scarred Staff Sergeant who quite frankly has had enough of the military before all this happens. The film pulsates along at a blistering pace which keeps you hooked to the end. All-in-all, the film did not disappoint and deserves a positive status in the sci-fi film universe.

just saw the movie WORLD INVASION, BATTLE L.A. it was an average movie. watchable but not worth the hype though with all the buzz created by the movie trailers. its a mix bag movie. SIGNS MEETS HURTLOCKER MEETS INDEPENDENCE DAY MEETS WAR OF THE WORLDS. the casting also left a lot to be desired. ECKHART was a waste and no other cast member is worth mentioning about. screenplay was slow in the first half while the 2nd half picked up with a few nice action scenes. barely any info was given about the alien invasion and about the aliens origination. overall i rate i 5 but it had potential to be an 8. the script was weak and this was the movie's major downfall.

"Battle: Los Angeles" is the latest addition to one of the oldest stories in science fiction: the alien invasion story. While most movies tend to treat alien invasion movies as disaster films, like "Independence Day", or survivalist films, like "War of the Worlds", "Battle: Los Angeles" treats alien invasions like actual invasions; that is to say, it's a war movie. This is both a good and a bad thing.It's good because, hey, if you're going for "realism", which all movies seem to want to do these days, there's no other way to handle an alien invasion. You break out the military in full force, and you focus on the fighting. Maybe, if you want to appease the sci-fi fans as well as the average moviegoer, you include some discoveries and theories about the aliens, which "Battle" does. It has a good premise: a worldwide war that focuses on one battle so that it doesn't knock itself, or the viewers, out trying to cover the entire invasion of Earth. It focuses on the marines and their efforts to evacuate civilians from the combat zone while only occasionally touching on the aliens and their technology/motives so as not to  um  alienate the general audience.It's also bad, because, while working in the obvious tropes about alien invasion, such as the superior technology, extraterrestrial biology, and overwhelming military force, it also works in quite a few war movie tropes at the same time. There's Aaron Eckhart's ("The Dark Knight", "Paycheck") character, Staff Sergeant Nantz, who's retiring from the Marines the very morning of the invasion. Ramon Rodriguez ("Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen") plays the young lieutenant fresh out of officer training who, despite outranking the older sergeant, still needs Nantz's guidance in leading the men (oh, and his wife's pregnant). There's even Noel Fisher, who's starring in the upcoming "Twilight: Breaking Dawn", playing a very young private who is constantly freaked out by everything that happens.It's not that they play these roles poorly; it's just that this movie doesn't really have anything new to offer. It's refreshing to see an alien movie that doesn't exploit an incredibly lame weakness (minor spoiler: they do need to exploit a weakness); but every trope, from both types of movie, teeters on the edge of being a cliché. And there are only so many clichés you can take in one movie, especially a "serious" one.I liked the movie; didn't love it, but I liked it. Aaron Eckhart almost never disappoints, and he did a good job in this movie. The interspersed moments of exposition, such as "experts" on TV discussing the aliens' actions, weren't the best, but they did make it a bit more believable. And there were some genuinely touching moments with the civilians they were sent to rescue. In the end, it goes for the trope, not the cliché, and it generally hits the mark.(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports)

As war movies go, ho-hum. Saving Private Ryan set a good example of how a war movie should look like, and still directors don't achieve that level, even if they are inspired by it. I can't quite figure out what's holding them back. It does work.But as alien invasion movies go, it's the most "grounded." You won't find any brain-sucking aliens in this movie, or U.S. presidents in fighter jets, or Microsoft viruses infecting the alien mothership, or aliens suddenly catching the flu and dying off soon after the attack. Because what I mean by being very "grounded" is the opposite extreme. It's not a movie about aliens, it's a movie about Marines at war, and while they are fighting aliens, there is nothing particularly "alien" about them when it comes to battle -- they're just tougher to kill. Therein lies the reality-flaw: aliens able to travel from another star (presumably) and swarm our planet shouldn't be using ballistic firearms, they'd be using something a lot more deadly and advanced. Gas? Lasers? Chemical / viral drops? And even if they went ballistic, the shells ought to at least be armor-piercing and heat-sinking. While the alien machinery was tough to beat, it wasn't impossible, and it didn't seem to possess technology that was in advance of ours. In fact, they didn't even seem to have gravity control, but rather their ships flew rocket- style. That's just so 50's, isn't it?There are many complaints about the shaky hand-cam effect in Battle: Los Angeles. Really? NOW everyone's complaining, after a hundred jiggling action movies in the last 10 years that have driven me to CVS upon leaving the theater? Even as a shaky-cam movie, it wasn't nearly as hard to watch as just a few minutes a Michael Bay movie. It's like all the cameramen these days have Parkinson's.And yet despite that I gave it 7 stars out of 10 here, which is pretty high, and I suppose I did that for a couple of reasons. One, it was the most superior alien invasion movie that's been done to date. It divorced itself from the ideas behind Independence Day, War of the Worlds (remake), The Day the Earth Stood Still (remake), and Skyline, and tried to deal out all-out destruction without any over- ambitious science fiction ideas or save-the-earth-from-humans propaganda. I appreciated that, although I wished there was more "Sci-Fi" and less "Marines." Aliens struck a much more satisfying balance between the two, and had better plotting, better pacing, and a cooler foe.Two, while the movie didn't take a lot of time to develop characters, the actors were strong performers that felt tangible and empathetic. I felt I was there with them, and that's where a lot of genre movies fail. They felt more like real people than actors playing people from a memorized script.But as a science fiction movie about alien visitation (not necessarily war), it's way, way down on the interest list. District 9 was much more compelling.

Poor character development and a worn out storyline make this a very forgettable film. I really didn't care who or when the next death would be. I probably wouldn't mind as much if at least one of the characters had been an annoying ass but it seems everyone was a hero, which ends up making nobody the hero.I had no sense of dread from the alien invaders. In fact, if they had changed the aliens to an invading human army I think the film would have worked better. For all the special effects, the aliens might have well been cardboard cut-outs. It wouldn't have made them less interesting.I came away from the cinema feeling like i had just watched a rather long advert for the marine enlistment division.

I knew it. I just knew it. Before I decided to go to the cinema and see this latest 'blockbuster' bucket of Hollywood dung, I knew that it would be exactly that. Memories of previous disaster movie bad choices - Independence Day, The Day After, 2012, War of the Worlds (Cruise version) - should have been enough to keep me at home. But no. I had to make sure. If nothing else, I suppose it shows that I retain some small hope of being pleasantly surprised... of finding something to match the excellent District 9, Aliens, Starship Troopers, Cloverfield, War of the Worlds (original) - even Skyline, at a pinch. I really should have learnt by now, though:- Hollywood Blockbuster = waste of ticket money.What can I say that hasn't already been said? Empty characterisation, humongous plot holes, risible script with the usual 'gung-ho' Marine clichés, nausea-inducing hand-held camera jerkiness all the way through... and the predictable overdose of apocalyptic CGI slash-and-burn that we've seen over and over and over again so many times that it no longer inspires anything except yawns.This is CGI action-fodder for the computer game generation. Don't make the same mistake I did. Spend the money on a take-out and stay indoors with a DVD instead.

I really enjoyed this film and you could to provided you go in it knowing what to expect.Its a Big budget Alien flick, so Action is going to be there, Lots of explosions, lots of characters (Living to die later) and some cheesy tacked on story. its what we've seen in Skyline, District 9 and independence day hell even clover field. I went in knowing this was a CGi flick that would have a flimsy story and Tons of action, and i was not disappointed. Anyways back to the movie.*********PLOT info (just the start!) ************ So it starts out with a Bang the marines are in a Chinook on their way to fight for L.A. the movie then cuts to 24hours hours before to introduce you to the cast. You have your token military characters here. A rookie lieutenant, another commanding officer with a bad military past (lost some men in the middle east and the marines. One about to get married, one who's brother was killed (in the command of the previously mentioned Commanding officer) and others (seriously who cares!) Anyways, plot goes that all of a sudden meteorites appear to be on their merry way to our beloved planet. Every shrugs them off as insignificant until they change their trajectory. Now they start on course to crash near the shorelines of major Cities. The military is mobilized, evacuation orders are issued and something strange happens,As they enter the atmosphere they start slowing down then land in the oceans. They then proceed to start attacking civilians who stayed to watch the (perceived harmless) fireworks... The shot then resumes from where it left off as marines go in to evacuate the remaining civilians before an air-strike order is carried out, One that the military hope will wipe of the enemy. I will stop with the plot here but it does take some interesting turns (but you will see them coming)*************I thought the story was pretty nice, it held the movie together nicely bringing sense to all the mayhem ( i kinda likened it to District 9: 2 - revenge of the aliens! lol. because the aliens do share some similarity to the ones we saw in D9) The camera work i thought as a nice effect but this is subjective, if you disliked Clover-field, you will not like this! and vice versa. It kept me at full attention following the action closely.So yeah, my first Movie review on this site and probably my last, I just think its unfair that people go in expecting some Deep and complex story from what was portrayed as a CGi flick. there is little character progression because there are a lot of characters! its not a love movies with 3 or 4 people, this is invasion from the perspective of some grunt trying to survive, What do they care whether you went fishing with your dad when you were 10 lol Anyways, if you liked transformers (CGi effects) , district 9 (the aliens), 2012 (the destruction aspect) and clover-field (the camera work) then enjoy!

Let me start out with what I liked so this isn't lopsided. The fight scenes were the biggest plus of this movie and I'm not the kind of guy who needs nonstop action. The aliens and alien technology we're pretty damn cool especially the flying drones which seemed to be the alien version of a muscle car. Unfortunately in between all the scenes I liked we're incredibly overacted dramatically sappy ones. In fact during the last 1/3 of the movie there was what felt like an excruciatingly long scene (prolly 5 minutes in reality) which dragged out it's attempt to tug at your heart strings. It didn't work, I found myself thinking about lunch and washing my car. I've never seen a movie before which brought me to such a high then dumped me in the toilet. Tone down those scenes, add in some more aliens and this would have been an 8 or 9 out of 10. I was actually sitting there amazed that some film executive didn't laugh at the corniness in the edit room or test screening and make some changes. I know I'm on the verge of beating a dead horse but the audience was filled mainly with young to middle aged sci-fi fans and you could feel the collective air of excitement being let out each time this happened. No matter who wins the battle, everyone who pays to see this will feel like they lost the war.

This review need only be short -- the reviews are right: they are panning Battle LA because it doesn't deliver on any aspect. The trailers are impressive and it seemed to be a potential new high mark for digital sci- fi end of the world, war movies, but B-LA is just bla-h. Now I've seen the movie and it's dreadful.It's boring to start and little confusing for most of the first hour! Good grief. The characters are unremarkable and each scene is a mess -- you could see what the director was trying to do, but the shaky-cam photography was painful and distracting.The characters were not taking shape and the plot never made an appearance -- there is no plot to spoil, so all I can do is avoid describing the details of how this movie misses. The lead male was meant to be the battle-hardened, thinking Marine and leader, but the actor delivers a "friendly teacher helps out the rag tag school kids" character. I think the lead female was there and looked the part and flubbed a few lines, but I think I could see the actor itching to contribute a real part, not just split second flashes in front of the camera to conveniently solve plot problems that cropped up all the way down the line.Sitting in a not-so crowded theater of mouth-breathing popcorn disposal units, you're checking your watch thinking "there goes another full minute of a close-up of sweat on a dirty face" ... but still, no story, no real action, just the looming suggestion that things are about to get serious.The computer graphics are unimpressive, the sound effects are separate and unrealistic, the movie just never gets going. Incredible for an action sci-fi movie that is surely 95% digital, but it's just boring. As I try to assemble the story, piece by piece, I think the failure began in the script and was unrecoverable. The sets were empty, silent and dry -- and a distraction like a low budget flick that can't afford swarms of extras to really create the scenes of chaos. And seeing dead bodies strewn across an open area with a convenient path just wide enough to drive through ... it was as if someone had left a big "X" with gaffer tape for the camera to pick up. Too many distractions to take you out of the movie.The leading male and the leading female both delivered a few seconds of reality, here and there, but woeful photography and feeble direction made this one a disaster movie.

This movie is a prime example of good CGI effects and a great cast of soldier made actors. If you are a person who loves epic explosions, pulse pounding firefights and cool looking aliens, then Battle Los Angeles is the movie for you. It shoves action in your face faster then the breaths going into your body and boy does that action look really nice. I really have to give a hand to the Special Effects team because they did a tremendous job with the pretty low budget for this kind of movie. The explosions look so real and the sounds are pulse pounding and crisp. Yeah there's a presence of shaky cam but if you get past that, there's SO much more to it. Acting wise, its surprising good from what i saw. I was going into this movie expecting average acting but there were several emotion and tear jerking moments in which the actors provided tons of emotion and i could help but tear up at a very sad death of one of the characters near the end. Overall, this movie knows what is and delivers for the fans. It was a lot better then what i expected and blew me away. P.S. If you are expecting an Oscar worthing movie, this is not your kind of movie. I hate people like that, with over the top expectations, they go into this kind of movie and bash it for its faults when the movie was not meant for that kind of over-analytical fan. Its a Sci-Fi Action Blockbuster that plays its expected job VERY well IMO and expecting a perfect movie is just not intelligent.

I've seen a lot of war movies and this was really interesting. It takes the tone of war movies like Black Hawk Down and really mixes it up with Sci-Fi replacing terrorists with aliens. Walking into this movie I only expected two things. Epicness and explosions and boy did it deliver. Once the s%@t hits the fan the action hardly stops until the very end. The film has a simple premise of aliens from another world invading earth for its resources and we have to fight them off. The action in the film is very constant after the first 20 or so minutes and the action itself really takes you to the edge of your seats but if the filmmakers could've took it down a notch with the shaky cam I would've been more satisfied. The shaky-cam in the film at some points left me feeling nauseous. Nevertheless I was quite happy with what we got. The actors in the film really did their part playing various U.S Marines. Aaron Eckhart was my favorite of the bunch though. He always was one of my favorite actors and played his part as Staff Sergeant well. The special effects were great. Almost looked like it was all shot for real with the shaky-cam. The aliens' design reminded me of the some of the enemies you face in the video game Half-Life. All in all I loved the special and visual effects in the film.The movie made me cringe, made me feel emotional at some points, and left me at awe. In the end the movie was exactly what I expected a fun Sci-fi war movie. While not the best Sci-fi movie I've seen it's certainly one of the most entertaining and intense ones yet.GOOD:great effects terrific action and pacing great performancesBad: Thin storyline a little too much Shaky-cam7.5/10 Overall 7.5/10

I see a lot of people hating on this movie, I just got out of seeing it, and I must say this movie is great, not gonna talk too much about what happened, but people are wrong to hate on this movie, in my opinion, the Aliens were very well done, and the idea was very interesting, and made a lot of sense, probably some of the best trained actors military wise i've ever seen in a movie, I have a lot of military friends, and they would agree they did a good job with this, the story is outstanding, and the idea will leave you wondering, could this really happen? If you like Sci- Fi movies, and don't get scared too easily, I recommend you see this, it's a good movie, done very well, absolutely spectacular.

As a former Marine I found this movie to be very touching. During the first few minutes of watching I was about to walk out of the theater because hand-held POV style camera work really isn't interesting to me but I decided to sit through the movie and am glad I did.The entire time I was watching the film I was thinking about the underlying theme and decided that the movie is a great portrayal of the daily life of our armed forces, but closer to home.The men and women who fight for our country deserve our respect because they might not be fighting aliens but what they have to go through is not that far off.

Over the years there have been countless movies about alien invasion from Men in Black to Independence day, Starship Troopers and War of the world, District 9, The day the Earth Stood Still, Signs etc...All those movies were great but lacked a little something. Whether it be a solid script/storyline, good acting, poor CG etc.Battle L.A. combines all of the above to create an exceptional Alien Invasion movie. The Acting is great, the CG is fantastic, the Script is strong (there are a few lines which didn't fit) and storyline intriguing.Some may say that the movie glorifies the Marine corp, but it is that aspect which makes the movie so captivating. The spirit of the marine corps adds to the emotion of it all. It makes the viewer feel immersed into the film even more. Some may say it is a recruitment attempt but hey its the Marines... They are a fascinating group. Whether it be following Master Chief around in Halo or SSgt Nantz around in L.A. it makes for a truly entertaining ride! From the helicopter ride in to the epic street battles, the movie does and excellent job at providing entertainment! Overall I have to say The movie does an excellent job at immersing the viewer into the chaos of this alien led invasion of L.A.. If you are looking for something which is realistic and informative then obviously this movie is not what you are aiming for, but if you are looking for an intriguing mind blowing action adventure then I highly recommend it! It definitely leaves one thinking, what would happen if something like this actually occurred.

I won't comment on the CGI of this movie. Having good CGI these days is like being a kid with a Gameboy at the playground - everyone has one.As for the plot, it probably got lost in translation, while the writer was trying to decide whether to make this movie about an alien invasion, a story of bonding between marines, a story of human suffering at the hands of adversity or all of the above, but each of the subjects done half-ass'ed.Every single piece of character dialogue in this movie is painful to listen to, it's like taking every dramatic line ever written in a movie and taping it together in this one. Actors try to make us feel sympathy for characters which have no character, i.e: "You're the army guy who got my brother killed, so I'm gonna comment all movie long about how you gonna get us killed too, until the end when you do a dramatic speech to me and I decide to be friends." Awww...Aliens are ridiculous, they can space travel but they use projectile ammunition weapons, almost no sort of explosives, and they have thousands of air support units but it takes one like 5 minutes between shots to fire again.In the end, 7 marines overcome thousands of aliens by destroying the mothership with a laser painted target missile barrage, almost Independence Day style.I wanted to scream out "Oh FOR THE LOVE OF GOD" every 5 minutes or so of the movie, but didn't in respect for the other viewers and endured 2 hours of this cinematic tragedy.

This is a summer movie. It's about guns, explosion, very little plot but it doesn't need a big plot. Very simple, Aliens with attitude comes to earth and we fight them. The movie just follows one platoon as they fight the invasion force in LA.First let me say, you may need a little Dramamine for this movie because the camera jumps around a lot. It is as if there is an embedded journalist with them. But the cool thing about this movie is the sound. It has such an amazing sound to it and its nice to be in a theater where you can listen to how cool this movie is. The battle scenes are fantastic and it's kind a very nice simple movie. I really like the special effects, I thought they did an excellent job making things look real as if this was taking place in LA. The alien don't look too fake and that is important.So just go to the movie and watch the bullets fly and the explosions and enjoy the popcorn. Totally worth going to the movies to see.

Complaints from critics that this is a summer popcorn flick are stupid because, well, who cares? Great script? No. Great acting? Not especially. Great special effects? YesLots of shooting and killing of invading aliens? Definitely!!I have to agree with the critics of the shaky cam, video game style, though. That doesn't usually bother me but this one was pretty bad - a few scenes are pretty much unwatchable. Made my wife physically ill. Did I mention the cool killing of aliens and blasting the alien invasion force?Pretty cool.

The grittier and slightly more realistic alien invasion film "Battle: Los Angeles" poses and addresses the intriguing question of how the military would respond in the event of a full-on attack at the hands of an unknown enemy. The answer? Clichés; tons of them. Round up the troops, grab whatever clichés you can find so we can get the hell out of this cliché, and under absolutely no circumstances should you leave a cliché behind — unless it's for the greater cliché. Whatever hand-held camera prowess director Jonathan Liebesman has is almost entirely drowned out in these and other unfortunate scripting choices. The film's exceptional marketing led many to make early claims of "the 'Black Hawk Down' of alien invasion films," but "Battle: Los Angeles" is not the intriguing possibility of an alien invasion film from a military perspective; it's a military film in which aliens grace us with their presence. I get that the military won't lend its assistance to films that portray it in a negative light, but "Battle" borders on propaganda in many instances. The overarching theme of the film can be described as nothing other than "the military will fight for us, sacrifice for us and never give up, even in the face of probable oblivion." Without question, "Battle: Los Angeles" would've been a runaway hit in 1950.Any connoisseur of disaster films will tell you the best of the genre make you care about and feel for the characters. Adopt that as a rule of thumb and "Battle: Los Angeles" rates poorly by default. That's not to say writer Christopher Bertolini, whose last script was "The General's Daughter" in 1999, doesn't put emphasis on character backstory, because there's plenty of it, it's just shoddy and overrun with soldier/war clichés (the lieutenant's wife is pregnant, one guys is about to get married, one guy is suffering from PTSD, one guy is getting over the loss of his brother who was killed in the Middle East, one's a young kid who's still a virgin and then there's Staff Sgt. Michael Nantz (Eckhart), who is about to retire and wrestles daily with the demons of the men who died under his command in Afghanistan. If that all sounds novel and touching to you, you have some serious movie renting to do once you get out from that rock. Even Eckhart, who really sells us hard on his leading man ability here, can't overcome the stuff he's forced to say.The invaders (other than making a Predator-like clicking noise) end up being more intriguing than the human characters because the film effectively paints them as mysterious and frightening. Science-fiction fans will quickly lose interest in the trodden war story characters and become much more fascinated with who and what these aliens are and how they operate. In most cases, focus on character development would be applauded, but Bertolini and Liebesman seem to have misjudged how effectively they developed them. There's too much downtime in the action for them to talk to each other, bicker, share their emotions and make poor jokes at each other's expense. Add screen composer Brian Tyler's elongated undertones a la "Platoon" and the scales are tipped toward an embarrassing form of melodrama."Battle: Los Angeles" talks itself into intolerability at times. Like that friend you had in middle school that seemed cool but just wouldn't shut up and thus became irritating despite the best of intentions, every time a character opens his or her mouth in this film, it gets worse. The action pauses much more than necessary and the space gets flooded in with emotional speeches, wisecracks and stuff we're supposed to find touching. All this would be a bit more effective if the magnitude of the situation came entirely across, but despite Liebesman's eye for action shot composition, it never does. The scope stays too narrow on our military friends and the film never develops the sense of life-threatening urgency that makes the disaster genre so effective in general.I've no doubt that if Bertolini spent half the time he took writing things for the characters to say and invested it in creating moments for the characters to interact with each other fundamentally, "Battle: Los Angeles" could've been much better. I'm all for solo scripting duties, but another more experienced writer needed to be on board it seems. Rather than let his characters grow organically, he imposes their backstory upon us, which also becomes painfully more obvious with inexperienced actors of which there are many in the film.From a visual standpoint, "Battle: Los Angeles" commands attention with hard-hitting action and engaging scenarios, but for a film that so clearly appears to follow in the footsteps of some of science fiction's finest films ("War of the Words") and more progressive offerings ("District 9″), it departs so drastically from that pedigree with the military-heavy approach. Science fiction usually serves as a social or political allegory, not a motivational poster for societal values such as courage and determination. Regardless, rubble, carnage and mysterious aliens ought to be enough to get the job done, but they're not.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com

It is one of the Best of the worst alien movies I ever saw. Probably the -10 rated movie. It is like watching an amateurs handy-cam shoot out of the incidents. The motto of the director of the photography is "Shake the Camera as much as possible". The motto of the Director is "Dont show anything still in the frame". The result is An amateurs handy-cam movie. The background score sucks. It is disgusting to see all the trained marines shout in panic and cry like babies in the movie. There is nothing new in this movie. I strongly recommend not to waste your time and money on this movie. I recommend the director and director of photography to enroll for the basic study in their respective field.

Movies like this are not for everyone. Yes the screenplay was totally unoriginal, and yes the plot was nothing. But who really gives a s***? Everyone would know that this isn't a movie that you see to observe story structures. This is a movie to have fun with, to watch great special effects and to be entertained. If you have a problem with movies like this, then don't bother watching it! You won't have to waist your time and you won't have to ruin people's opinions on it who actually enjoyed this movie. If you've already seen it and you hated it completely because of just the plot, then shut the hell up. No one wants to hear another one of your complaints on how dull the script was.That being said, I enjoyed this movie. The effects looked so real that at certain points it felt like I was in the middle of the war. The shaky camera added a great effect to the realism, and it wasn't too shaky either. Sure, there were a few takes that seemed a little too shaky, but it was still easy enough to know where everyone was in relation with each other in a war scene. You would know what each character was doing weather it would be reloading their guns or taking cover behind a rock, and then you would still know where they would be and what angle they would be shooting at. They did a great job choreographing through all of the fight scenes. The sound was unbelievable. It was very loud and very realistic. There were lots of nice "boomy" effects that made the intensity meter go way up.I loved the aliens in this movie. They didn't have too big of a sci-fi look. For one thing, their guns looked like real guns. They had loud banging sounds and real muzzle flares. When you see them firing their guns they don't have green lasers coming out with some weird synthesized zap sound effect. And the flying saucers didn't hover like any of the other saucers would. There's no magnetic pull or force that keeps them hovering. They use jets to keep them flying. It made the aliens seem more real than regular sci-fi aliens would.The music might have been a little bit over done. About 98% of the movie was filled with intense military music. Lots of horns and drums going off and it got a little bit old after a while. They did however did a good job capturing the moments of silence.Overall, this is a satisfying movie. Go see it to have a good time and don't be too critical about its script or its story. The acting was good, the effects were good, the sound, the aliens, and the music were also good. There is, however, only one part that was really unnecessary. Not trying to be too critical about this but the first two or so minutes didn't have to be there. When you see it, you'll understand why. It began almost exactly like Skyline (which was a terrible movie). But other than that, enjoy the rest of the movie!8.5/10

Going in I had high expectations for this movie. I love war movies and the idea of mixing a war movie with Aliens seemed right. When I walked out of the theater I got exactly what I wanted a full blown action movie and after 3 months of only watching Oscar contenders this is exactly what I wanted to see.I've been reading other reviews about people complaining about not enough character development, storyline not original or acting was terrible I say who cares. This movie is exactly what I thought it would be a movie that keeps you entertained right until the credits roll. Also, the acting was not that bad, nowhere near Oscar quality, but good enough for a big budget action movie. The biggest issue is the dialogue, it is a little cheesy at times and doesn't give the actors much to work with, but I wouldn't say it's every time they open their mouth just some lines in the movie are a little rough.The CG is amazing and the action sequences are very well done. Another complaint I've read about is the shaky camera work, the camera is shaky at times but nothing like Cloverfield or District 9. It might shake for about 15 to 30 seconds and then the shaking would stop. The movie reminded me of Black Hawk Down, Which is one of my all time favorites, I'm not saying it's as good because it's not, but the action sequences and storyline felt very similar only this movie has Aliens. Honestly if you like war movies and don't mind movies with Aliens check it out cause I don't think you will be disappointed.

I went into this movie with a pretty high expectation, not going to lie, only because of the very FIRST trailer that I saw a few months ago. Ever since then I really didn't watch the other previews, in fear of them ruining my overall view. So here in my opinion were the pros and cons.Pros: ....Decent-Good Cinematography. If you liked how Cloverfield was shot, you'll love this. Great opening 2-4 minutes, Action scenes good, but not great and not enough.Cons: Awful acting, Terrible dialogue, Predictable (If you've seen war movies, you can guess what happens next), Too many to list here.There was really only one way to save the movie, and that was to have the aliens win for a change. I thought this was the entire concept, apparently someone in production thought otherwise. The another issue was when Aaron Eckhart's character was explaining to another Marine, that he knew all the other Marines he had lost, and after this amazing speech he says, and I quote, "But that doesn't matter." How are you going to have a great speech and ruin it?And the last line of the entire movie is, "We've already had our breakfast." Really?? That's how the movie ends, and the saddest thing, people applauded, I cried a little on the inside. In simple terms:Independence Day - Will Smith - Good Movie + Same concept(of aliens and how to kill/destroy them) = Battle: Los Angeles. If this was on the Sy-fy channel, or however you spell it now, this would have been a good movie.

First and foremost....A) District 9 is not Earth vs. Alien. Why? There wasn't hostility that we didn't deserve necessarily. There wasn't war. It was simply us taking in refugee aliens and trying to harvest them for their technology. We're so awful, right?B) Aside from Independence Day ( amazing movie by the way,) there wasn't a movie that really helped the audience feel engaged in a war type movie pertaining to aliens..until now.Skyline was just disgusting. I'm not even going to bring it up.I can see people connecting both of them being easily influenced in this movie.. Obviously we need something to work from.Its not your typical sci-fi thriller. Its a lot more raw. Being a remake and seeing the original, you'll see very similar attributes..but as you can see from the trailer, our technology has come very far.This is a story of survival; pure survival.Its painful and honest, and you will feel every second of it. You'll be terrified from its realism, you'll be crushed by our weaknesses as human beings, but fall in love with our unmatched will to live. You'll sit at the edge of your seat and grow to love and hate every person you meet in this movie, and you'll pray with them. I don't suggest reading a lot of reviews, only because its very hard not to ruin the movie.Its not the best movie ever made, it does display flaws. But this film has come far and coming from the director Jonathan Liebesman ( Chainsaw Massacre,) some movements and camera angles are hard to understand, even stomach. Its fast paced and LOUD.In short: This is a war movie. If you like the style, its completely well worth it.And for people expressing their most sincerest of thoughts about it being cliché: This is Hollywood, get over it. Eventually even independent films and its style will be consumed by them.

This film is for anyone who really enjoys a good sci-fi action packed flick. Though it follows the typical cliché elements of any alien invasion movie, Aaron Eckharts performance as a tough military leader boosts the films overall value. The characters are what makes this film above average. Each character brings their own unique qualities to the film, which bring the it some humanism and some relation to the audience. Without the strong core of characters this wouldn't be as memorable a movie. The plot doesn't really fall under anything unique in that it's just 'aliens are unexpectedly invading we have to kill them' Anyone who enjoys action and special effects with a little substance, this is the movie for you

The Viral Campaign and Marketing for BLA were more intriguing and enjoyable than the film itself...the historical event that really took place in Los Angeles should have been referenced as well as the eyewitness accounts of what was seen...however the movie diverted its attention to a squad of forgettable marines, a worn-out storyline, non-existent character development, and mashed it with Skyline CGI prowess...Save your money and get it on netflix or rent it when available...6/10 is my rating....

If you like Independence day you will like this. I felt like this movie was legit. Some parts were slow but overall it was a good/decent movie. I don't know if it's worth 15$ but definitely 10$.My review needs ten lines. The plot was a good sci-fi plot. the actors were great. I actually jumped in the movie theater. I almost thought my heart couldn't take it.overall, compared to the recent aliens vs humans movies this is pretty solid. The part that wasn't so good would be a spoiler alert which i don't want to give away. But the ending was satisfying for me.hope that helps.

What I'm referring to in my title is the simple fact that in M. Night's "Signs" aliens invaded our planet and tried to colonize it but their weakness was water and in this film, it seems to be the exact opposite, fuel. I seriously doubt that it was a slight against M. Night but I found it amusing. That said, I didn't like this movie as much as I really wanted to. I was caught up in the hype, hoping for a good and solid war movie and when it came to the trailers, I gotta say, it was edited perfectly for marketing but also pretty scary. What I mean by that is that in the trailers there's almost no signs of "shaky-cam" implemented in the scenes chosen and yet in the film there were barely any steady shots. It was literally about 5 to 8 minutes worth of those in the entire movie. I understand that during combat scenes those kinds of shots are used to build tension and cause you to feel apart of the action but it was completely overdone. That and the quick cut editing made the battles almost completely unclear and unwatchable. The only battle that had some great shots was the first half of the final stand in the movie, up until the point where a certain marine gets killed on top of a building. When I saw that I said, "now, where was THIS in the rest of the movie?" Also, the aliens, to me, weren't that interesting, because... 1. You rarely got a close up of them 2. When you did, they seemed uninteresting, being bipeds and all, you didn't actually get to see a good overall anatomy of the alien creatures. A few slice and dice to find a weakness shots and mostly medium to long shots of the creatures. 3. They only showed one type of creature up close when there were clearly more varieties of them. 4. Their weapons weren't really that different, I mean, except from rounds that cause instant third degree burns, there wasn't that much of a difference, they shot out missiles that looked EXACTLY like our species. This is a big spoiler coming up, my main gripe with the movie which I'll probably share with many more viewers to come about this movie so... SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT!!! The aliens crash land on our planet under the guise of a meteor shower, one in which we are only able to find out that the structure of the supposed meteorites is actually quite different from others when it enters our atmosphere. They amass ships from unknown sources.(Meteorites again? It wasn't made clear.) And bury massive comm/control ships underneath metropolitan areas without digging. But what really takes the cake is that they are this advanced yet they need water. Are you telling me that they can't molecularly manipulate hydrogen and oxygen and configure water from those elements? Really? They hid in a *beep* METEOR SHOWER AND RAISED SHIPS FROM UNDERNEATH METROPOLITAN AREAS and I'm suppose to go, "oh..well at least we can synthesize DNA, so just chalk one up for us humans..." So, with THAT being said... SPOILERS OVER SPOILERS OVER SPOILERS OVER SPOILERS OVER SPOILERS OVER SPOILERS OVER!!! I really wasn't going into this thinking this was gonna be completely devoid of holes and I would have let all of these things slide if I had gotten what I wanted, what I was expecting, SOLID ACTION. But thanks to the overabundance of "shaky-cam" I got almost an incoherent mess of battle scenes. Well, the acting was borderline decent. Cliché lines and an all around cannon fodder for a cast, but they weren't god awful, just like this movie wasn't god awful but it was just OK(and I'm being nice here.) Overall, it's worth a viewing...matinée viewing or a when it's on DVD/Blu-ray, a rent. Don't spend 10 bucks just because you're curious about this movie or bored.

In the main, a dull, predictable, cheesy movie.The camera shake employed whenever the action ramped up detracted greatly for me. I can only assume the technique is being used to keep the budget down, as it serves to make it impossible for the viewer to see any detail in the shot (so less money/effort spent on props, cgi etc).The big plus was the stunning sound effects. Truly spectacular. I'm sure home cinema salesmen will be using this movie to demo surround systems for years to come.. the added bonus being that prospective customers will rarely be distracted by the images on screen.A throw-away flick with a movie theatre soundtrack & straight-to-DVD visuals.

Why does a particular species of humans have the overwhelming thoughts/or is it instinct stating that aliens are out to kill them, etc. In general, humans are too self-destructive, stupid, and primitive to become worth the time for interstellar space traveling beings. I'm sure they find us interesting to watch as we allow oppression, destruction of the very world we are a part of, and continue to propagate ignorance. We even ignore common sense solutions and make ourselves fear changes. The premise of a domination motivated alien group bent on the eradication of humans is nearly preposterous. Even taking into account the hundreds of validated sites of visitations, the clear majority of them were obviously observing us. Most likely for historical recordings of what we are doing to ourselves, what we are doing to the planets biosphere, and what technologies we create. Star Trek (First Contact) is a much more realistic story. --Good special effects in the movie though.--

Alien movies have become as popular as vampire movies, Cloverfield,Skyline, and many other horrible movies that have unfortunately graced our eyes in the past years. But I knew going into Battle:LA that this was going to be an improvement, and I am happy to report that it was even better. You know the summary of the plot,aliens invade,people die, Marines fight to win. What you don't know is how the movie ends, or what else happens in between, first off may I say that This is the first time(for me) that a alien invasion movie has a way of actually stopping the invasion(not so much clover field). That for me made me love this movie, but even with that huge victory, the movie still ends with a cliffhanger that is a perfect ending for this particular film.With that, the effects were fantastic, the sets and locations were great (although i'm a little mad that gas in the movie was $2.69 right??In Santa Monica no less, yeah I wish) The acting was great, not Oscar worthy, but good enough to where it is believable and the audience will relate too. The aliens were amazing, they are like District 9 and predator aliens combined, a very refreshing take on the overdone extraterrestrials of our past movie experiences.So action, alien lovers rejoice for you will enjoy a movie that accomplishes what it sets out to do, entertain on a whole new level,and keep you on the edge of your seats.

If you are really looking to waste two hours of your precious life, then feel free to give this piece of crap a try. It's awful... just awful. The production company is called "Original Films", which is ironic because there is absolutely nothing original about this movie in any way. It is cliché after cliché. From a marine who wants to retire being called in to a "one last job" scenario, to a kid loosing his father and begging "please wake up" over heavy synthetic violins. It's awful... just awful. There is no objective, no plot, no story, nothing but flying bullets and low-fi "dancing" CG aliens. With the high budget of this movie you'd think that they could at least afford good looking CG. The animation and special effects in Terminator 2 were far superior... and that was made in 1991... 20 years ago!!There's a simple game you can play with this movie. Whoever falls asleep first, wins. Yes, it's that boring.But what is really depressing about this is the fact that Aaron Eckhart is a fantastic actor. It is a real mystery why he chose to be a part of this misguided production. He wasn't bad in this movie, either, but given the fact that there was no story, no character development, and soul-killingly lackluster dialogue, even his finely tuned chops weren't enough to make this movie entertaining.

The basic premise of this film, and about the only original aspect of it, is, "What if you took a science fiction trope (alien invasion) and put it into the framework of a traditional war movie?" And, ultimately, this film is much more of a war movie than a science fiction flick. All of the clichés from war movies are there ("Black Hawk Down" seems to be the single biggest source), and scarcely any attention is paid to the science fiction elements at all. This premise could have produced a great movie if only the writers were up to the task. As it is, the film is pretty bland, containing just about every cliché in the book, both in terms of story and dialogue, although I give it some credit since it certainly did hold my interest for two hours. And it is the first alien invasion movie I've seen that actually attempts to depict the terrestrial military's response to the attack in a realistic manner. In that it is somewhat original and enjoyable. Both the 1953 original and Spielberg's remake of "War of the Worlds" toyed with this concept a bit, although since the emphasis in those films is on civilians rather than soldiers I don't think they count.To enjoy this film, you have to resist the urge to analyze it too deeply. Or to think about it at all, actually. It's yet another in the long line of recent films about aliens with the capability of crossing the galaxy but who still have difficulties foiling a handful of enterprising Earthlings ("Signs" is the worst offender in this regard). Still, I have to say, I love war movies about tough, determined soldiers, and if you do as well then you'll probably like this film. I certainly enjoyed it much more than either "Independence Day" or "Avatar."Hopefully some other group will use this concept to make a really GOOD SF war film, but I'm not going to hold my breath considering the trends in Hollywood.

I love a creative science-fiction flick. The operative word here is creative. This movie fails miserably on creativity. The director thought it would be a good idea to rip-off 3/4 of the storyline for Independence Day, throw in shaky camera work to make it look like a war- documentary, and package it as a hit sci-fi flick. The only thing that earns this movie points are the acting of most of the people in light of having a crappy, over-clichéd script with almost no character development, and what I deem to be a flaccid plot-line that's been played out far too often in every other alien invasion flick. Wait for this movie to come out on DVD. Save yourself a few bucks and a severe headache from the horrible camera work.

I have a whole new level of respect for Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin. Sure, Independence Day might not have been great cinema, but at least it was FUN cinema. The build-up to the invasion, the famous shadows of the ships, and the diverse and amusing (if occasionally goofy) characters added to its popcorn-movie charm.Battle: Los Angeles has none of these things. It makes ID4 look like Hamlet.Where to begin with such a frantic mess? How about the characters, of which there are...I'm not sure actually. They're all so disposable that they blended together after awhile into a uniform military mass of gray. They are so thinly realized that a slight breeze could blow them away like torn tissue paper. Even Aaron Eckhart, who was one of the highlights of Dark Knight, is slumming here. His character, if you could even call it that, becomes more ridiculous over time, leading up to an absurd speech near the finale that had the audience in stitches with how poor the dialogue was.And just how much product placement was in this movie? I counted at least a dozen, if not more, products or services put throughout. I was beginning to think the only reason they picked LA was because of how easy it would be to give screen time to the products sticking awkwardly out of every crevice of the film. And O'Doul's? Really? What was everyone thinking? If this is the output of writer Christopher Bertolini, then he is a hack. No wonder his last produced feature screenplay was in 1999 -- BECAUSE HE'S TERRIBLE.But director Jonathan Liebesman deserves a huge amount of credit for descending this all into Hades. Never has the use of shaky-cam been so annoyingly overused. I was beginning to think the entire camera crew was cursed with Parkinson's. It didn't make me motion sick, but the talentlessness did make me nauseous.The aliens were the least realized I've ever seen in a film. They act as distantly-viewed antagonists, blowing the living crap out of everything in a search for...well, I won't spoil it, but suffice to say that it's as terrible a revelation as in Signs, and makes just as much sense. At least Signs was good for about 3/4 of its length, where as this was miserable from the first frame.After an interminable period of time, I just began to actively think every 15 minutes or so, "Surely it can't go on for much longer." And then IT DID. By the end I was about ready to burn down the theater, just to leave a smoldering crevice behind as a marker of how awful it truly was.So why two stars and not one? A one-star film is one that should never have been made that actively insults the audience. But a two-star...that second star is a reminder. It's a reminder that throwing a lot of money and a few stars at something makes it neither workable nor good.I urge -- no, I BEG -- do not see this movie. Tell your friends not to see this movie. Tell everyone that you ever cared about that this is a soul-sucking experience, a waste of two hours that you will never get back, and could be better utilized by sleeping or staring directly into the sun.

Just come out of this film in Nottingham, after eagerly anticipating it for six months or so. I was pulled in by the viral marketing and trailers, hoping that this film would do the genre some justice after the mock-buster Skyline, and live up to the hype. I went in with high expectations, and I have to say I was not disappointed in the least.The film starts out sprung into the action, with fantastic cinematography and special effects, instantly I was gripped and on the edge of my seat. 'Spectacular' and 'Intense' (the descriptions on the trailer) I could easily say were the words for this film, and then some. The aliens people argue are unoriginal, but I thought they were menacing and fantastically designed for the film. Aaron Eckhart deserves an award for his portrayal as S. Sgt Nantz, a battle hardened Marine who puts in an admirable and intense performance, I thought he and the rest of his platoon (Michelle Rodriguez, Jim Parrack and even Ne-yo), put in realistic performances, with one or two corny lines, but that is it. People who slate the dialogue for this film do not sit back and take it for what it is, a balls out alien invasion war film, set in the US. Now here is what really angers me, I attempt to spoil myself stupid before films come out so I know that i'm in for something great when I buy my ticket. Before I went to see it last night though, I read a scathing review from Roger Ebert, giving the film half a star out of four. Now looking back at what I have just seen, Im no loser Ebert, I just happen to have a passion for the science-fiction genre that made me go to see it, just like tens of thousands of others. This is a man if I believe, gave Knowing four stars, and Kickass One star. He shouldn't be a critic, because what I've just seen was out of this world unbelievable. He needs to rethink, because this film doesn't deserve half of the bad reviews it gets...I implore you to see this film, its a fantastic sci-fi war adventure movie, that will have you on the edge of your seat from the start. A must watch in the cinema, so much that I will see it again! 10 of 10.JF

So apparently, the blockbuster season has begun early. Much like it did last year with the average Clash of the Titans, we get this release.After we were treated to a couple of months of some fantastic movies, Hollywood decides not to make film goers too intelligent.Basic premise of the film....Aliens invade, soldiers have three hours to rescue Michael Pena and a vet, before they drop a bomb. That's it.It's your classic disaster/patriotic movie. At the beginning, we are treated to the 'hit list' of characters. Each one as uninteresting as the last. Ones getting married, ones Brother has been killed in action, one is a virgin. You can play the 'guess who is going to die first' game with this introduction.Then all the usual clichés kick in. Eckhart plays a staff Sergeant who made a decision that ended in the deaths of a few of his soldiers (one happens to be the brother of the aforementioned). He has a perplexed look on his face throughout.Then we have the leader who bottles it halfway through the film, but then becomes a martyr through self sacrifice.We have the tech whizz, who is also handy with a gun.We have crying children, a dying father, a dog, and a final push.It ticks every box in every film that has been produced by Bruckheimer/Silver and directed by Bay/Emmerich.Where this film differs though is due to a very poor script, which is funny at first, but soon grates, forgettable characters, and sloppy editing.Effects are okay, but gone are the days when that sold a film. if the film didn't takes itself seriously and had a few funny scenes inserted into it it could have been a fun film, but this Black Hawk Down/Independence Day hybrid fails miserably.A few scenes of promise (the opening attack on the beach, and a freeway assault) show what this could have been, but ultimately, this is poor work.

This is, by far, the worst movie I've seen... period. This should be labeled as an advertisement for the marines, because this was nothing else than some army, hero propaganda... clearly made by some idiot in the pentagon. The storyline doesn't even make any sense.. OK, the movie is about alien invasion but common.. the screenplay is made like people are brain dead. I was actually offended how stupid these guys think the audience is.The story is in short: SSgt. Nantz is a marine with a debatable history from the gulf war. A long time is used to get you that lazy shallow point. Then the aliens attack. The aliens, from light years a way, have a crappy technology apparently. They have some missiles and assault rifles. They're ships are armed with the same weapons. They also have a huge mother ship that controls EVERYTHING and they have it stored in Los Angeles so the 4 people that star this movie can destroy it with one missile and be the hero of the movie. Once destroyed, every other ship will fall down of the sky and the war is over. This how dumb they think you are. OK, from the beginning to the end I described there's a lot of whining.The film follows on one troop through the movie. L.A. is in ruins, people dying all over the place and when they come across some family of civilians.. all of a sudden the whole movie is about getting them safely home. WHERE? Yes, home. L.A. is under alien control and is in ruins, but these guys are getting them safely home. That's the plot line of this movie. The story just goes away from the fact there's an alien invasion to some "civilian" dude who's the main subject of the film for at least an half an hour. Until he dies, luckily, but then there's like 10-15 minutes of whining and drama because of it. This guy barely said 2 sentences in the movie and they're waisting 10-15 minutes of time of the sorrow of his death!!?? Hello, the alien invasion.. remember?? So, you just can imagine the crap between the beginning and the end... "We must save the civilians", "No man left behind", "We are the marines, we never quit"... If you are going to watch this, get yourself a bag and be ready to puke... big time.

Did they even watch the final copy before releasing it to the distributors? Where do I start? The bobbing camera is OK for a few scenes, but why use it for everything?...Everything! - Aaron Eckhart is delivering clichéd, teary lines and the camera is jerking like it's on a motocross dirt-bike. It get's worse as the movie progresses, with action scenes blurred out to the point of incomprehension because of all the shaking. You get only glimpses of all the panoramic shots of LA. The rest is all blurred out in a mayhem of out of focus camera action and more shaking. Of course, you never get a clear view of the aliens, all you'll remember is that their infantry look and act like those Cylons in BG. Storyline? There isn't one worth talking about. *sigh* What has happened to good movie-making skills these days?My wife got sick by the end of the movie and I managed not to by looking away when it got really bad. Do yourself a favor and give this a miss.

As the name suggests, the movie is based on an alien invasion across the whole world. I had awaited this movie for a long time after watching its trailer. I was really amazed at first to see the special effects and realistic fighting scenes. The aliens were not detailed properly by the animators which was clearly evident from the few scenes which contained them. I liked the special effects, the guns and the explosions, after all that's what all "alien invasion" movies are based on. However,it had something extra which u don't find in such type of movies.If u really wanna have 116 min of fun, try watching it in a theater and please sit a bit closer to the screen, I am sure you all will have a breath-taking experience...! Have fun...!

I keep reading reviews from people who don't think that this was a good movie. For what it was, it was a decent representation of what being in an urban combat environment would be like. I have been a United States Marine for over 13 years. I have served multiple times in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Combat has no plot. No story line. Heroes are measured in the battle field not by death, but by the mark that they leave behind. The memory of the heroism and heroic act that an individual would have performed most times ends in death. Americans take for granted that they have never been invaded. That they have never had to fight house to house, trying to take back our own land inch by inch with an enemy that doesn't quit. It's a shame that people are so closed minded, because they have never experienced it. Thank a Soldier, Airman, Sailor, or Marine for being willing to take it to the enemy in any part of the world at a moment's notice. The movie itself had a lot of great content. The focus on the human spirit and will to not quit even when everyone around you is being destroyed. As a species humanity prides itself in overcoming adversity. People need to step out of their perfect bubble and see that it might not be aliens who we might have to fight someday. The Japanese managed to sneak to our shores and Bomb Pearl Harbor with very little notice. Our Pride at times gets the best of us. People might say that this can't happen today, because they assume that the blanket of freedom that they enjoy and technology won't allow it. Unless you have served and know what it takes to live free and the price required for that freedom, you shouldn't take it for granted. Especially if you have done nothing to contribute to it. I am definitely going to see this movie again. Semper Fi.

The best part of the film to me was the cinematography, the movie just looked fantastic. Action was great. At times it could be a little shaky, and there could have been more medium shots. The guns sounded real, the explosions were real and the actors looked great as Marines. I thought the acting was actually good, not the greatest, but not as bad as some people are making it out to be. Also I thought the aliens weren't too bad either.There were a couple negatives. Like critics have said the dialogue and character development can be a little weak and a little cheesy. But, again, I didn't think it was as bad as people made it out to be. And the other negative I saw were the aliens in combat. There were two scene in particular were they just seemed kinda dumb.My dad and I are going to watch it again in a few weeks, simply because during some scenes there is just SO much going on, but that wasn't a bad thing, in my opinion.ON first view 8.5/10

This film was actually a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I walked in expecting basically everything the original few posters on this site stated: sub par acting, sub par plot, shaky camera, etc. What I got, however, was a much more enthralling experience.Lets talk abut the cinematography: Yes, most of the movie is shaky cam. Is it as bad as Cloverfield? Absolutely not. It is used modestly and seemingly very controlled. The film does NOT feel like a bunch of kids are shooting it with handicams. They really did a great job at bringing me into this alarming and scary setting and placing me beside these characters.Speaking of characters, the other posters seem to believe that every character here follows an explicit cliché and is, therefore, boring and amateur. Not true. Other films feel the need to sell us these actors as people, throwing family stories, explanations, and long-winded monologues at us to make us believe that this is real. This movie does away with all of that and relies on short bursts of conversation and the body language acting of the actors to display emotion. Yes, Michelle Rodriquez just plays yet another version of herself in this movie. Is that bad? No. She does OK. The movie isn't about one or two guys. There is no love story. It doesn't really matter if the characters are a little cliché (which I didn't really notice as much as some of these other posters did, I guess). The movie is about a team of Marines fighting an enemy that no one knows much about. Speaking of which, the Aliens are very well handled. There isn't some all-knowing force that can explain what exactly planet Earth is up against; we learn about them through this platoons attempts at understanding them. I thought they did a great job with the battles. The city FEELS destroyed and hopeless as the characters are fighting their way through. The battles are well paced and give ample down time in between. The director did a great job at giving us a very literal 'Alien' enemy, that works and functions in ways we haven't seen before. I mean, you do have to suspend some disbelief. For instance, if a completely alien culture is invading planet Earth, why would they have weapons that shoot fully automatic laser rays? Does every developed species with weapons get to the fully-automatic stage of weapon-izing and stop? And the final battle seems a little too easy for our heroes. But none of this kills the suspense of human beings attempting to survive a desperately terrifying situation.Basically if you came to this movie to see a war film set in Los Angeles that just so happens to involve aliens, then the movie will not disappoint. However, if you came expecting Two- Face to go Arnold on some Covenant, Modern Warfare style while surrounded by hot women and no responsibilities, then you will be disappointed. Battle: Los Angeles is human, modest, and huge at the same time. Bravo

The alien invasion film is certainly nothing original. Recently, and upcoming, I can think of no less than 4 film and TV versions of this basic tale. Battle: Los Angeles doesn't bring anything new, plot wise, to this scenario. In fact, it operates on the thinnest of plot and some very underdeveloped characters. The only somewhat unique aspect, at least for an alien invasion story, is its gritty "you are there" aspect, filmed in a hand-held, jerky, thick of the action style. This isn't revolutionary either, but Battle: Los Angeles does manage to squeeze some momentum out of its running length.As mentioned above, Battle: Los Angeles' plot can be summed up rather succinctly: Aliens land on Earth throughout the globe, including near Los Angeles. This alien force, operating with ground forces, begins to overrun the various cities they arrive at, and LA is no different. A squad of marines, led by Staff Sergeant Nantz (Aaron Eckhardt) is dispatched to attempt to retrieve possible civilian presence from a Santa Monica police station behind the front lines of the fighting. They encounter heavy resistance, and must find a way back to their forward operating base while keeping the civilians under their protection, and themselves, alive.Battle: Los Angeles is obviously influenced, visually, by movies such as Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan in the staging of its action. Much of the film is photographed with hand-held camera moves, the focus constantly whipping around, disorienting both the characters and the audience. While the technique is hardly unique, it does work to a degree in Battle: Los Angeles, bringing a different approach to a familiar plot. This isn't about scientists trying to figure out what the aliens want, or politicians wringing their hands about the "big decisions" in the midst of an alien onslaught. Battle: Los Angeles keeps its focus exclusively on the soldiers in the thick of battle, presenting the action in a no-holds barred manner. It is refreshing, at least from that perspective, to see a harder-edged, more realistic take on this material.On the other hand, Battle: Los Angeles is a bit weak on the character front. The most development is given to Sergeant Nantz, who had just recently returned from a tour in Iraq where lives were lost and many assume he was to blame. This plays into several moments in the film, influencing other characters regarding the decisions he makes during the events of the story. Beyond that, aside from a few obligatory references to someone's relative or background, none of the other characters see much development. Physically, they are different enough to stand out from one another, but they are all mostly blank slates. There isn't complete detachment from the audience, several moments have some resonance emotionally, but not as much as if the filmmakers had taken some time to flesh the people out a bit more.Battle: Los Angeles also suffers from being a bit overlong, and it's relentless, action oriented approach means that a lot of similar scenes play out over and over again: Marines trapped in combat, things don't look good, a character makes a choice or sacrifice, they manage to subdue their attackers, and then the film moves to the next scene in this same format. There is also little or no development of the alien menace. Snippets of television coverage featuring scientific experts fills in a little of the backstory to them, but it is mostly incidental. However, Battle: Los Angeles is not created in that style, it is about the action going on with the marines in the thick of it, and stays in that mode.Aaron Eckhardt proves again his ability to sell a character, and he imbues Sergeant Nantz with a vigor and a degree of weariness that you buy into. Most of the other actors do a decent job of making us believe in these people as Marines in the thick of combat. A few recognizable names take roles, including Michele Rodriguez as an Air Force tech who joins up with the Marines and Bridget Moynihan as a civilian they are trying to protect, but neither has much to work with in regards to their characters other than to look tough or scared, respectively.Battle: Los Angeles is certainly no masterpiece. It doesn't deviate much from the alien invasion template in regards to the broad strokes of its plot, and the style it was filmed in has been pioneered by other films. That being said, the film is engaging enough, and applies its style to a source material in a way that at least gives a different perspective on a familiar narrative framework. That doesn't make for a tremendous film, but not one that is completely in need of avoidance by the filmgoing public.

This movie delivered exactly what it promised. The trailer never teased that this movie would have amazing acting or characters, it just showed us a really awesome looking alien invasion, and that's why anyone who saw this movie bought a ticket. The above reviews that give Battle:LA a low score because of the less-than-perfect acting are being too hard on it. Sure, the acting is more similar to Independence Day than District 9, but it doesn't detract from the movies enjoyability. In fact, the action and visuals feel almost exactly like District 9. While the shaky camera did get a little annoying, I like the Cloverfield style of camera work, and it worked well for this movie.So basically, Battle:LA has acting similar to Crash (strong, but not exactly believable) and special effects almost exactly like District 9 with the camera work of a Bourne movie. That's what you should expect.

This film suffers from the worst directing that I have seen for awhile. Everything is close-ups...and they are EXTREME close-ups. Every time someone speaks it seems the director wants us to only concentrate on the mouth, nose and eyes. Two-shots in this film are almost non-existent! Scenes are cut so quickly that one cannot keep track of what's really going on...does the director think that frantic cutting makes a film more exciting?The script was trite, with the protagonists constantly making speeches in the middle of battle. All the characters along with the plots found in old war movies are here...none of the characters are new and none of the battle directives are new.Finally, other than naming streets in Los Angeles, what did this movie have to do with Los Angeles? This movie could have taken place in any major city. They could have integrated some more of the Los Angeles landmarks into the story.

The good news: The movie is 90% action. The bad news: The movie is 90% action, filmed by using hand held "shaky cams". Almost gave me a headache 20 min. into the film. I'm not a video game first person shooter player. Maybe that would have helped. The remaining 10% non-action calm camera scenes helped keep my eyesight usable. However, half of those scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor, as much of it felted like it belonged in a different movie. Distracting to say the least. The saving element here is at least it was an attempt at presenting a sci-fi/effects action movie (my personal favorite). I waited months, through all the delays, for this movie to make it to the theaters. At least the theater popcorn was good, and I used a free admission pass. We suffered through films shot in near total darkness (AVP-Requiem), lense flares (Star Trek) and shaky cams. What's next?

Movie was good, although in the end I felt like something was lacking. You might think they could spawn several episodes off this one movie. With the main theme being Battle LA, the fact the movie shows just one small group and their encounters on their mission, kept me thinking during the movie, "but whats going on over there, and over there?" . I even found myself saying during the movie, that they should have the gang bangers with their guns attacking the aliens also. lol And to see LA on fire and smashed was pretty cool. All in all, it was close to what I expected, and I am glad I was able to contribute to my local theater here in San Clemente, Ca. T.C.

Battle: Los Angeles is an excellent popcorn movie that is intense throughout. It jumps right into the action with news reels and clips showing the initial meteor shower and invasion. Then it jumps back 24 hours, introducing us to the characters and their personalities. This is where I could find my only real gripe with a film of this kind. Every detail about these soldiers is later explored to greater depth in the midst of the warfare then in these 20 minutes. Some of it could have been cut down. Aaron Eckhart, Michelle Rodriguez, and Bridget Moynahan all give great performances and steal the show. I was initially worried over Ne-yo's part in the film, as rap stars in movies usually does not bode well. (See: Terminator Salvation) However, he was given a small supporting role and got a couple funny lines in, so nothing to worry about. The action was fantastic, especially the freeway battle and the marine's last stand. One last point I have to make is that this film wanted to be as realistic as possible, with the battle of Los Angeles still up for grabs by the end. This isn't one of those flicks where a seemingly invincible protagonist and his squad single-handedly take out the invading force's entire operations. They do however, take out their air support in LA, with concentrations of ground forces left by the end. This sort of creative decision made me respect it even more. Of course, it's open for sequels, as the film mentions dozens of other cities being attacked and with LA not even under the human's control yet. However, if that were to happen, as long as it is under Jonathan Leibesman's directing abilities then I'm sure I'd be happy.

I wasn't expecting Shakespeare,but honestly just watch district 9 again its far better in all categories. We have the just out of military school captain,the old experienced retired,but brought back into service for the last time commander who has to take orders from the newbie.....again watch aliens Cameron does it better. This movie wasn't shot in LA ...and it looks like it wasn't anyone familiar with the city will see it,a lack of wide establishing shots apart from very wide FX gives the game away.Independence day did annihilated LA far better than this effort.SPOILER:the only cool shot was aliens emerging from the ocean,but that was seen from TV perspective..so even that lost its impact. Save your money on this one.

Okay this is not a movie about story, but surely it's obvious to see that in the trailers. This movie is about taking a location that is not really used for anything except soap operas and chick flicks and turning it into a battlefield. If you can cope with that then this movie isn't awful like a lot of people are saying. This movie has a lot of strengths for action lovers. The marines jump right into the fray within the first fifteen minutes or so and the action continues to pour in throughout most of the movie. Firefights, marine maneuvers, communication and motions, and actual strategies are incorporated into this movie, which was the director's goal in this project. Yes, there are some obvious solutions to the problem, aka nuke the zone, but then that wouldn't be a really long movie would it? Continuing on, another key factor that is seen is the brotherhood that soldiers have between their own platoon and the friendships that they make. Combine that with the action and you get the suspense that makes you connect with the characters hoping each one survives. Heck you may even pick a favorite character to root for in hopes they survive. Another strong point is that the movie keeps going, with very little slow scenes in the mix, so again action lovers will love it. Yes it kind of causes the story line to be narrowed out, but again you shouldn't expect a story from this kind of movie. Weak points from this movie start with the choppy camera action used to record this movie. It's filmed with moving with the soldiers and is really quick and spastic. If you get motion sickness, then you may not want to watch this movie. Next up the dialogue is very cheesy at some points. They try to bring comedy relief in the intense situation to keep you from getting too depressed in the film. But let's face it dialogue today isn't really written in the best sense, aka half the lines on Glee and other comedies of today. Get past that and again the movie isn't that bad, in fact you can actually laugh at how ridiculous the lines are which lightens the mood a little. Again I've already mentioned there is no real story to it, but again it's one of the action film fan's audience. Not too mention it really is hard to get a good alien invasion storyline that hasn't been done or isn't a marvel comic. Another weakness can be a little of the poor acting in this movie and the overacting at certain scenes. The parts where aliens aren't trying to blow your head off can make you roll your eyes, but that's with any movie really. Another weakness is there is some predictability to it, especially when it comes to death scenes and as a result you may guess who is going to die next. However, what movie doesn't have some predictability to it. The last thing to comment on is the graphics of the movie. For the most part the aliens are obviously CGI, but they are done pretty well from what I can tell. I'm no expert in the field, but it looks pretty decent and I have to say I don't have the eye to tell green screen from actual models. Overall I enjoyed the movie, I've been an action lover for a long time, but have branched out in recent years mind you. This movie is exciting, action packed, and has a strong message of brotherhood in the marine life. I think it captures some military lifestyles and situations, but again I don't know. Yes, I know nuclear warfare is obvious, but again you want a movie you go for the more extreme case. As long as you can get over the cheesy dialogue and the lack of story, then I think you will enjoy this movie. Overall I give it an 8 out of 10.

I came, I saw, and I was entertained Bottom-line.Anything more than that is over analyzing something that is fairly straight forward and simple. Were you entertained or not? I do not need some—more often, uptight, self-absorbed, self-proclaimed intellectual type to tell me what I should see and what I shouldn't. I'll make my own decisions thank you. Let's face it, nearly all critics are (self-styled or published) basically masters of mediocrity, they cannot produce the things they critique and so they criticize it and often negatively in order to get a sense of self-importance. If you need another opinion, fine ask for it, it's your right. If you need to criticize something by all means it's your right as well.But to tell others that you're mental retarded if you see it? To say you are tired of the clichés, look at the movie you watched. That the soldiers in the film are so predictable, are so cliché, and you don't want to know about them—again look at the movie you watched (because you have watched enough military movies and or played enough first-person shooting games so you know the deal right?). Aliens that have been documented in real life that are visiting Earth are only here to observe? Before you begin an invasion campaign you need reconnaissance before your invade to carry out the invasion! Duh! They are observing us! And if you are going to criticize someone at least get your facts straight. Those were marines and air force in the movie, not the army. The US Army wrote the script to the movie? I love reading movie reviews but I largely ignore most of the content within. Well except for some truly bad reviews which I will go see just for myself and who knows? I may be surprised. What I find fascinating are all the things people will say. That is just as entertaining as watching the actual movie. Most often I find myself laughing because it proves a lot of my points. Many critics may think they are smart and worldly but in actuality they are self-important, and plain stupid and too dumb to realize it. The movie studios are in business to make money from entertaining the masses. So I will say again, did you enjoy it or not? What did you expect from an Alien Invasion movie? They have been around since the early 1900s with the invention of moving pictures. There is really nothing truly original anymore—from mankind's point of view. And when the aliens do finally arrive I am certain they will either totally confirm what we believed all along or totally surprise us to the core, I am for the latter. To say that aliens do not exist is just plain ignorance. Bottom-line. Did you enjoy it or not? Were you entertained or not? And so, having expressed my own opinions, have a nice day and keep the laughs coming.

Intigued by the YouTube trailer, I decided to go see Battle:LA. I'd hoped for something better than the ultimately disappointing Skyline. Maybe just about at Independence Day level (updated for our more cynical age...).Wow- was I pleasantly surprised! I got great acting from the always good Aaron Eckhart, Bridget Moynahan,Jim Parrack (Hoyt Fortenberry, in TrueBlood). There was realistic, war-like carnage. Good SFX and I didn't want to laugh when I saw the aliens. The character development whilst sketchy, was enough to make us genuinely care what happened to the group of people who were the focal point of the film.Its a simple premise. Massive asteroid shower turns out to be an alien invasion which instantly becomes an all-out onslaught. Staff Sgnt Nanz, a 20 year veteran,and his young lieutenant Martinez, lead a group of marines in a small mission to rescue a group of civilians trapped in a Santa Monica police station, whilst chaos reigns as all the different military machines in the major military powers on earth are being wiped out. Things have gone so bad, so fast, that the US military are having to adopt a 'scorched earth' policy, and flatten all along one densely populated coast. So the marines are working against the clock to complete the evacuation before the bombs drop, and everyone dies. A simple plot. I went at 12.30 in the afternoon, just before the Saturday shopping, expecting to be pleasantly diverted.It started off as per most of these alien invasion flicks...then turned into 'Black Hawk Down' with the intensity of the urban warfare scenes, and the desperation of the group's situation. I watched it with my 20 year old son and we were both mesmerised. I'm frankly mystified by some of the negative reviews I've seen. Honestly,people.This is well worth seeing.

I guess you've got to be in the US military or somehow related to somebody in the military to fully appreciate this movie. Personally, I think there was a lot of unnecessary marine cheese. I've played call of duty series and a lot of scifi games in my life -- Battle:LA's story didn't quite nailed it. It seemed to be targeted to both scifi fans and war movie fans but it didn't pass. Cinematography, settings, graphics & action did deliver though.Those aliens are smart and managed to get to earth but failed to guard their command center? How stupid is that? A 6-7 marine squad took down the command center with tons of aliens dudes with much more advanced weaponry than M16s. If the aliens managed to travel in space and got to Earth, I don't think they lack strategy or are stupid enough to left command center under such small care. That was too easy. The director needs to play more scifi games to get his story straight. He's just not there.The whole story isn't solid. There are pieces floating here and there. Staff sergeant spent so much time trying to find the weak point on the alien body but never really put it to use that much. Lieutenant's death wasn't necessary. Are you effing kidding me? I'd have dragged him out of there and let the c4 in the bus triggered some other way. Bull****! The "I'll be strong and going to become a marine because of my brave father" sh.it didn't work for me either. The whole squad should also rest up for at least an hour or two to work more efficiently as well.The real marines and marines in Call of Duty are cool. The marines in this movie aren't. The story goes anywhere as it pleases. Didn't follow logic. things happen too easily. Unrealistic and too cheesy. the aliens become stupid suddenly by the end. I'd expect a lot more defense from them. I'd expect a lot more marines to die and finally win by some other means rather than a 6-7 marine squad taking down a command center. I'd expect a hard fight. I'd expect alien commandos or ninjas guarding the command center -- not a floating tank done which could easily be taken down by a grenade. See? A lot of holes.Nonetheless I enjoyed the action. So there it is, a 6.

Battle: Los Angeles maybe just your average alien invasion film, but it's extremely good at what it's got going for it.The choice to film in a hand held fashion is one that has been met with slight mixed criticalism, I for one enjoyed it. As soon as the film starts you are thrown straight into the action and the realism is actually phenomenal. Aaron Eckhart is as good as they come and he was perfect to lead this film, all the acting was of a decent level, there were no terrible performances, even from newcomer Ne-Yo who although didn't have many lines was still alright.The visual effects were of a brilliant level, the aliens looked cool and a sense of threat was captivated throughout the film from them. Just when there's a quiet talking scene, a huge battle scene will commence where Director Jonathan Liebesman will show you everything you need to see to have you on the edge of your seat.Why it was felt that Skyline would have been a threat to this film I don't know, because it really does blow it away in terms of story (Which in both films isn't amazing, but in Battle LA it's better), acting, and battle scenes in Battle LA completely blew me away.Basically Battle LA is not an average alien invasion film. It's an all out Alen War film which wastes no time is setting the standard of action you're going to see throughout the whole film."Let's show these b******s who they're f****n' with!" Quality film.

Bad writing and acting are prevalent here - if you're looking for mindless entertainment this movie delivers - if you're looking for a 'good' action flick - rent Independence Day.This is a run-of-the-mill action flick - we saw it as a preview and the theatre was packed - and the audience seemed to enjoy it but it was an overall gratuitous movie.I wouldn't waste money on this one - not even for a matinée - it's really a shame because Jim Parrack from 'True Blood' was in it as well as Michelle Rodriguez ('Lost') - two decent actors who have done MUCH better stuff - but, I guess everyone has to pay the bills.

With all the disappointing review, I was reluctant to see this film. Though I am glad I did, it was a mixture of Black Hawk Down, District 9 and Cloverfield which worked fairly well. I can see why some people would rate it poorly, as there is little character development and story, but it is obvious from the title that this is going to be an all out action film. The Cinematography was a little stomach churning, with the "shaky cam" being used in nearly every shot, but it was not enough to drastically reduce my overall opinion of the film. Overall, I would say that most of the review are irrelevant as this is definitely a film you need to see for yourself to decide whether its any good or not. I gave it a 9/10 partly to bring up the overall rating, as I can just see people desperately trying to bring it down, but also because I felt it was a generally worthwhile film...Certainly better than Skyline-

I go to Transformers to see Megan Fox look good and giant robots fight. I went to Battle: LA to see the American military and aliens shoot and blow each other up.A lot of people seem to think this was supposed to be some kind of District 9 movie. Sure, if you evaluate it on the same scale as District 9, it sucks. But if you just wanted to see an awesome action movie, this is the movie for you.Yes, there was no character development. Yes, the plot is a zillion years old. So what? I wasn't looking for those things. Now and then, it's nice to go see a movie with mindless action. 100% of this movie was mindless action. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy it. Compare it to a movie like The Losers or A-Team where the movie tries to build up some characters and an original plot and fail miserably.I would also like to add that there are some nice original points to this movie. For once, the aliens are not infallible. I get pretty tired of the oh-lawd-we-hit-them-with-nukes-and-didn't-kill-one type of alien movie popularized by Independence Day. There is no magic bullet in this movie, the aliens die from bullets, and you have to take out the command and control center to do serious damage (hey, just like in a conventional land war!). I also thought this movie was a decent depiction of a realistic military response to an alien attack. Everyone mobilizes, surrounds the landing zone, and combat ensues when they are attacked. Pretty simple.I also see complaints about camera style. I honestly didn't even notice. It didn't seem any worse than, say, Black Hawk Down.So I give this movie 8/10 on my action movie scale. If you were planning on evaluating it on the thoughtful-work-of-art scale, you must not have seen any of the trailers.

This movie basically is what it says it is - an action-packed alien invasion movie about the fight for Los Angeles against alien invaders, with lots of explosions and hardware. Don't go into it with expectations of a great plot or overly complex characters.But within that bound, it's excellent. The action is exciting and often jolting (the movie only wastes a short bit of time before getting into the thick of things), the characters simply drawn but sympathetic, and the visual effects are impressive. I was sitting on the edge of my seat for most of the film.MILD SPOILER: The aliens themselves are refreshing. Rather than being an "Independence Day" style "invincible menace" with Silly Movie Lasers and Magic Shields, they fight with tactics, cool-looking war machines, and powerful drone aircraft - using bullets and missiles. Their technology is superior, but not so untouchable that the characters have to resort to a silly cop-out in order to defeat them in battle.

There are most definitely spoilers here, people. I need to rant, I just came home from watching this... thing that somehow passes for a movie. It definitely was entertaining, to say the least. Let's see, you know when a movie sucks when characters are dying (most of whom you cannot remember their names) and you feel nothing, or when you are wondering what happened to that dog Glenn rather than that other guy who was just shot in the face! It kept panning to whoever was talking, EVERY SINGLE TIME! No, I really don't want to see that cleft one more time when you tell us "It. is. seared. in. my. BRAIN" Harvey Dent (what was his characters name anyways?) I can say this, the kill-y parts were pretty cool, but it kinda screamed "KIDS! JOIN THE MARINES AND YOU WILL KILL ALIENS WITH 7 OTHER PEOPLE WITH LIKE NOOOOO HELP! AHHH!" Well, a wasted 10 bucks on movie that I had to look away because the camera moved so much, or had to bury my face in my mom's sweater to hold back my tearful guffaws.

I went into Battle: Los Angeles not knowing what to expect. When I first heard the title and premise, I was anticipating just another mindless, sci-fi destruction film, aka last year's Skyline. The trailer however, was well put together and made me wonder if we might have a more well rounded and emotional film on our hands. I was actually intrigued by it and my desire to see the film increased, as did my expectations.The film starts out strongly, amidst the turmoil of the alien invasion, as we follow the tension of the soldiers as they approach it. This definitely captured my attention and felt like we possibly had a strong film on our hands and thenthe narrative began. As soon as the "24 hours before invasion" flashed on the screen, the two biggest problems with the film became apparent within minutes: screenplay and camera work. I was instantly annoyed by the camera work in the film, as the narrative began with SSgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) jogging on the beach outside of Camp Pendleton; everything was super close and hand held. Throughout much of the beginning narrative, I was distracted by the amount of camera movement and close up shots. It was hard to get a grip on everything, since it was impossible to take in the entire surroundings of scenes. During the action scenes though, I didn't feel that distracted by the hand held work, as it was effective in making you feel as if you were in the middle of the conflict. However, there was no need for the amount of shakiness during the narrative scenes and I felt that it detracted from what was happening on screen.The screenplay was definitely the Achilles Heel of the film. The dialogue in the film was absolutely horrendous and it seemed to be filled with every sci-fi/destruction cliché imaginable. It was peppered with clichéd characters, scenarios and predictable scenes, as if not much time and effort was put into its writing. I can imagine the writers sitting down, watching every alien movie ever made and writing down their favorite scenes from each and jumbling them together into a script. Nothing about the story itself was original or surprising, it just felt like a rehash of its predecessor films.Aside from these two areas however, the film was still definitely an enjoyable 2 hours at the movies. It was filled with testosterone and adrenaline, as the marines battled the invaders to take back Los Angeles. It definitely felt like an ode to the Marine Corps., as scene after scene painted them as self-sacrificing heroes who are here to protect. Eckhart was also another positive for the film, as his performance was outstanding, even with the clichéd character that he was given to work with. There were also a few scenes that were a little touching, which I attribute to director Jonathan Liebesman, as he was able to pull some great emotion from such a weak script. I also liked the gritty look and feel to the film that he achieved, which kept the film from feeling like a cheesy, made for TV sci-fi special.All-in-all, Battle: Los Angeles was an enjoyable experience and one I don't regret, even with my screening gypping me of the Super 8 trailer. Even though it was no Discrict 9, it was still entertaining and didn't feel like a complete waste of celluloid like others from this genre (another plug against Skyline). So I would definitely recommend it for those looking for a solid action film that is not ruined (thankfully) by every studios' decision to bludgeon us with 3D.

OK - first, this is my first review here - so I must explain my point of reference. I usually go to movies with pretty realistic expectations. If the movie is coming out in the Summer, then I know it must be a blockbuster. If it comes any other time, then I don't really expect the best movie ever. With that said, I enjoy pretty much any sci-fi or action movie I go watch - and I try to review with the fact of what I see, rather than my emotions towards the flick.Battle LA, I just couldn't wait for this movie! The movie was neatly produced, great plot and nice details in the storyline. The movie is a combination of a war action movie and a typical alien invasion movie, to be more specific, combine HBO's "The Pacific" and "War of the Worlds." Key details that make the movie great are in the setup of war tactics and general production of special effects. The action sequences and the music keep you at the edge of your seat for most of the movie. And actor Aaron Eckhart and Michelle Rodriguez bring the plot more credibility and carries the rest of the cast very well. Possible Spoilers: On the downside, the movie could have spent some more time in the development of the early stages of the invasion, and perhaps show some battles from that stage. Additionally, the movie could have shown a little more damage sequences to landmarks of LA and that area. Also, the alien weapons are not very sci-fi, in fact, District 9 weapons would have been a perfect fit for this movie. Finally, some of the cast members at times get in the way of the flow of the movie - but this is not a problem overall.My recommendation is, go watch it!! The big screen is a big plus for this movie, and the theater sound is essential to obtain the separation of special effect sounds from the suspenseful music that goes on throughout the movie - which is a key element to this film.Also - you should go watch it now - because next weekend "Source Code" is being released - and thats another must watch!

Battle LA surprised me quite a bit. After reading Roger Ebert's scathing review, I went into it with a chip on my shoulder. I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least, that Ebert's review was nonsense and that most of the critics who pan this movie don't really know what they're talking about.Battle LA ultimately succeeds because it pulls off what no other alien invasion movie has: realism. If we were to be attacked next week by some kind of extraterrestrial invasion force, I'd see it playing out a lot like this movie. We're not told what their motivations are at first...because, honestly, we would have no idea. Real life doesn't play out like a conveniently paced movie. Ebert criticised the movie for having flat, militaristic dialogue -- guess what? about 90% of this movie is combat. There aren't time for sweeping speeches and grandoise passages of dialogue when bullets are flying and you're fighting for your life. I really appreciated that the dialogue was incredibly authentic, although none of those soldiers were foul-mouthed enough to be real marines. ;) Another thing I feel was grossly overlooked was how real the actors were. They walked, talked, fought, and even held their guns like real Marines would. They fought intelligently and used the exact same kind of tactics and techniques that our boys over in Iraq and Afghanistan are using today. No one ever sprayed and prayed or shot their pistol one-handed...they were acting like legitimate soldiers. The entire intention of this movie was to put us on the ground, in the squad, and see how they reacted to an interstellar war that they had no idea about...that they had to quickly adapt to. Yes, some of the characterizations are slightly cheesy. And it's true, the climax felt like they ripped it straight out of a Call of Duty game (WE NEED TO DEFEND THIS POSITION UNTIL THE MISSILE ARRIVES!). But all in all, Battle LA pulled off exactly what it was trying to do: a realistic take on an alien invasion, as well as a look at it through the eyes of a squad of Marines. The critics who were expecting it to be more than that were very obviously missing the point.

I gave this film 3 *** . The fight scenes are hart pounding if you like war moves . But the PG13 rating cut out cursing and horrific battle wounds mostly disembodied alien's ,One solider rips the body of a wounded alien apart with a knife to see why they don't die after 100 rounds don't kill them, and the human's had light bullet wounds. At the end of the movie it felt like a propagandistic film prepared by the Military to seduce 13 year old children to enlist at age 18. The soldiers act immature with "hoora" and "retreat hell" even suffering 45% mortality loses at the start . I'm not saying it was a Saving Privet Ryan film that i gave 10 stars too. But a rating of R would be welcome .The Aliens details are hard to make out and the weapons too might have been lack of money for High FX rendering.If you liked the war of the worlds remake then this film is 5% better .

I was leery on seeing this one, mostly akin to the fact that I hated Skyline and this movie is very similar to that particular film. A friend of mine wanted to go see this, and I needed to get out, so we saw it. I'm glad I did.To be truthfully honest, I wasn't paying much attention to the beginning. You see, I have this thing where I go off into my own world, leaving it to the movie to take me out of my world and into their's. Luckily, the movie did this successfully and I was engrossed into the story it was telling.If you don't know by now, the movie is essentially about Marines fighting aliens who are trying to colonize in Los Angeles. There really isn't much more than that. I can, however, tell you what part grabbed my attention and helped me focus through the rest of the movie. It was the scene where the Marines were going through some fog, walking between two buildings. Then they get startled but it turns out to be a dog. I thought to myself, "Uh oh, movie, if you invite an animal along, the audience is going to care more for the pooch than the characters you were establishing." The dog disappears and the Marines are ambushed by the aliens for the first time. From this point, I was interested and I was actually invested into the characters; especially Aaron Eckhart, who's a good actor anyway.Along the way, they pick up some civilians which consist of a man, a woman, and a couple of kids. Despite a lack of character development, I did care for these characters enough to feel sorry for any of them if they ever get shot down by the aliens. This element did help some intense moments, especially the scene where Aaron Eckhart must elude one of the alien aircrafts to a gas station. There was a lot of these tense moments all the way up to the end. It was an action extravaganza and I was entertained. Coupled with that and some decent acting from the cast, I didn't have much to complain about. Even the shaky cams didn't bother me too much, though sometimes it felt totally unnecessary. The main ingredient here was that I wanted to be entertained, and I got that. It's definitely better than Skyline, but I don't see this one being the best of the year. 2011 is still early, and we have a lot of films to go. Summer is upon us.

I expected a Sci-fi movie, but I found a hybrid between a video game commercial and an US Marine propaganda.The movie is filled of war rhetoric: lines like "Marines don't quit" or "you are the best marine I ever met" towards a 9 years old child make me sick and really worried about the future of Hollywood cinematography in the USA.If I wanted to see a war movie I surely would choose a documentary as "Restrepo" which tells me the real story the US soldiers are living on their skins.In Battle LA for the first hour we, as audience, are following three hours in the movie, and the time goes really, really slow. The realistic gunshots noise is unbearable; I thought I was watching someone else playing a video game in Dolby surround.Even the worst Rambo was better than this; at least there you expected to see bad acting in a cold war environment, but here with good actors as Aaron Eckart (who recentely delivered a good performance in "Rabbit hole") and Michelle Rodriguez (very good in "Avatar")you expected something more.My question is: have the US Marines recruitment issues? There aren't enough joiners so they need movies like this?? Advice: don't waste your time with this movie, you would regret and I hate to say: "I told you"!!

Before writing I had to think really hard how much I liked this movie. I really want to give it a higher score, but can't bring myself to give it a score over 7/10. The plot was generic and I wasn't impressed with some of the acting. I did like the visual effects. By saying that I mean the explosions. If you like explosions then this movie is for you. The pyrotechnics team made a fortune from this film. I was let down by the aliens. I felt like I was seeing alien outlines most of the movie and not seeing them up close. This movie was made in "Shakavision" most of the time. You see the aliens through a gun scope 70% of the time. This is not to say that you won't see the aliens up close, just not enough for me. I did like the alien forms, they were a little different, but not enough to go down in alien movie history though. This is a good matinée and not bad for an early March movie. This isn't Independence Day, but it is a movie about aliens.

Not the best sci-fi flick I've seen, not the worst. The movie starts with a rockin' song & moves quickly to the action; lots of smoke, gunfire, perturbed Marines, darting shapes & weird sounds (which strongly reminded me of the velociraptor sounds from Jurassic Park). It had me glued to the screen, jumping at every sound & invested in the happenings.The middle section of the movie dealing with a character's lingering death & his plea to save his orphaned son has been done over and over and over again in other films & I'm tired of those schmaltzy attempts by the director to tug at our heart strings. I'm also familiar with the "I'll stay behind & set off the bombs so the rest can live" martyrdom shtick (Armageddon, anyone? Aliens, anyone?). Maybe I was getting battle-weary.The final third of the film again had me pulling for the survivors to finally get the hell outta there. Jeff Goldblum figures out that if they can disable the mothership, this will ultimately aid in the defeat of the extraterrestrials, so he & Will Smith take off from Area 51 in an alien spacecraft...oh, wait, that was Independence Day. OK, so our Marines figure out something similar, and are then led by the tortured and misunderstood staff sergeant (who earlier had bared his soul to his platoon, and won their loyalty forever; I, myself, would probably have been worried about getting out alive & trying to rest after such a hellacious day, but that would be too realistic & boring) to carry out a similar strategy. All ends well for the few Marines & civilians not already picked off. We Americans have once again singlehandedly (!!) figured out the secret to alien destruction & proceed to tell the REST OF THE WORLD, who are unable to figure this out without us. Yay, us.Did the movie keep my attention? Yes. Was I entertained? Yes. Was it realistic? Probably not.

like other reviews before mine, the acting was surprisingly good, considering the cast. Arron Ekhart portrayed his character extremely well, and the other casts members pulled it off with good marks as well.First, the pros: great acting, great special effects, plot/editing was good, story progression was fine now for the cons: shaky cam!!!! aarrghhh!!! OK, i get it shaky cam is super awesomely fine for action scenes, helps add to the whole "dude! a bomb just blew up next to that guy over there" scenes... but why oh why on earth does the director feel the need for extensive shaky cam beach running scenes!?!?! the first 10 mins of this movie i was like "Oh god i hope there's some action soon b/c i can't stand another minute of shaky cam character 'introduction/building' scenes...which brings me to my next gripe, introduction of characters; it felt like a freaking role call, was boring as he!! and it didn't make me care one bit about the soldiers that were inevitable about to die. they all looked the same and were just another face in uniform to me...overall the movie was boring, and riddled with clichés, i felt like i was watching Saving Private Ryan(eehhh) with a dash of Cloverfield(Which I loved!!!) stirred in to give it that special mouth feel... i'm ashamed that I dragged my husband to it, and irritated that he got more enjoyment out of this obvious "guy flick"... but then again i'm a girl who loves loves loves Skyline and was hoping that this was just going to be another "skyline" but just less pretty and more "real" as seen from a marine's POV. all i got was a bunch of 2 dimensional characters w/ little to no development, and tonsOshakeycam!! if you are a guy, you will probably like it, if you are a girl who loves marine-war movies, football, or any other manly sports, you too will probably like it..

Even without the fancy 3D gimmicks, the way they delivered and presented most of the film felt like it really pulled you into the action and be part of it. It's probably because of the hand-held/amateur video style, but unlike other hand-held/amateur (or so called "cloverfield camera") style films, such as Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity, this film still looks back to the real way a feature film should be... and that is to be cut at the right camera angles... The unique thing is that they put normal camera and cloverfield camera styles together properly.. which makes it very pleasing to watch.OK, more on the plot. The story had it's own twists, although kinda predictable, I think it was still well thought. At one point you'd say, "That guy will definitely die" yeah, he will.. although, after that you'll regret you thought he'd die because it was just sad. And that's awesome, because normally, if you know someone's definitely gonna die in a movie, you don't feel compassion for them, but in this case, you will.From time to time, you'd say "Is it done?" but no, it's not yet... There's more! It's like, they want to feed you with things you actually expect or know will happen, but with some twists and turns which makes it awesome.The main actors were also very excellent in acting, I think they did very well here.The sound effects and music was also well thought and well produced/mixed. It gives you the real feel of what's happening.Over-all, everything is put together nicely and well made. Oh, and expect some surprises along the way... I would highly recommend anyone to watch this.

Battle: Los Angeles begins with warnings of meteors that will hit the earth within minutes. What soon becomes clear once shots are fired from the places that the so-called meteors hit is that these are no meteors- but Aliens.More than an Alien based movie, it seemed much more of a war movie in my opinion.After this Alien Invasion Los Angeles becomes one of the last remaining cities in California. Now the focus is on keeping it intact no matter what. It's U.S. Marine Sergeant Nantz who within minutes of resigning is called back on board and assigned to a platoon whose lieutenant is a sharp young man under the name William Martinez who has graduated fresh from school. Although he claims to be at the top of his class there is nothing that can prepare him for the real deal.I walked away thinking that the movie had so much more potential. With actors that were on the brink of being bad actors but not quite there yet- hung somewhere in the middle, and with a story like this to fill out you simply; I would think, can't afford that. With bad dialogue and cliché's the movie is basically a let down, and just full on action. While entertaining surely many will leave remembering not one name, and feeling nothing for any that died or survived. Say what you will but this is always a bad sign. I was not emotionally connected to one character apart from that little boy, and even then just about. Wait for it to come out on DVD I would suggest, and if your overly curious heck go watch it. It's a decent movie IF your into your action in which case " BOYS" will be booking their tickets instantly upon hearing this I suppose, but honestly? Not worth spending your money on. I would recommend you insert your DVD of Saving Private Ryan and appreciate truly amazing cinema at it's best.

I'm not sure what other people were watching but I was watching a very entertaining alien invasion movie called Battle: Los Angeles. All I keep reading and hearing is that this movie does not have a great story and that its just like every other alien invasion movie. So what? How much a story do you expect from an alien invasion? The story is that we are being invaded and we have to defend our civilization. Period. Go watch a drama movie if you're looking for a perfect story. If you're looking for a great action packed movie then Battle: Los Angeles is a must see for you.I went into the theater expecting to see aliens blowing everything up, and for humans to attack back with everything we got. I got just that. The movie was loaded with awesome visuals, sounds, and excellent acting. Yes if you look at the cast you might not like some of the names, for example.. Ne-Yo, but he was very well casted for an excellent role is this movie. Michelle Rodriquez and Aaron Eckhart did a awesome job like most of their other movies.I rated this movie 8 out of 10 stars because of one reason. I would of much enjoyed this movie more if they would of shown more of the entire military fighting off this invasion instead of just a group of marines. I'm sure if we were getting invaded by aliens we would have all the branches rolling in for combat. Don't get me wrong I loved watching the Marines kick ass throughout the entire movie and obviously the first ones in would be the Marines but to make a perfect war movie, it would of been more proper to put our entire military into the movie. All in all, this movie was absolutely entertaining. If you're ready for some action, then do not hesitate to go see this movie. Critics should really give this movie much more credit then given. I'm a huge war movie fan and sci-fi. I love Aliens, Avatar, District 9, and Independence Day. This movie is similar in its ways and also different. I would absolutely rate the action in this movie up with those titles.

After seeing the original trailer at the cinema's i thought "WOW Battle Los Angeles is gonna be awesome!"...................... How could i be so wrong!If you haven't been to see this film yet, don't!....... wait for its DVD release, which i can imagine wont be too long.If your a big computer gamer or sci-fi fan i feel you could take some pleasure in watching this film. Some of the scene's of the war torn landscape and the odd skirmish make for good watching. However, majority of the dialogue and acting makes you cringe! During some parts of the film i could even feel the audience cringe! When the credits rolled i left the film disappointed, it could have been so much better!

Greetings again from the darkness. The downside to being an eternal movie optimist is that the falls can be very hard. I had hopes going in that this could be a sci-fi, alien-invasion, doomsday special effects flick that would deliver a few thrills and chills. Not. So. Much.The two best things I can say about the film are: 1. Aaron Eckhart has a great face for a grizzled Marine. 2. The film is loud. Loud and Noisy. If those don't sound like resounding endorsements, it's because I really, really, really disliked this movie.Aaron Eckhart gives it all he has as the 20 year Marine who has put in for retirement. He also has a somewhat gray mark on his record from his last assignment, where (rumor has it) he was responsible for the death of men in his command. That really ends the depth of the film. Eckhart gets dragged back into active duty when a meteor shower turns out to be an alien invasion.This ludicrous alien invasion is evidently for the earth's water. Somehow these aliens have run out of water on their planet, wherever that may be. They are smart enough for intergalactic travel and drone activity to minimize their own damage during the attack, but they can't figure out how to successfully take over Santa Monica from a hand full of Marines.I found myself laughing on more than one occasion and I am quite sure that director Jonathan Liebsesman and writer Christopher Bertolini had no visions of this being comical. It is supposed to be a blend of Independence Day, Cloverfield and War of the Worlds. It isn't in their league ... and I really didn't care much at all for two of those.Bridget Moynahan, Michael Pena and a couple of kids are tossed in to soften the military slant and try to bring some human touches, but none of it works. Neither does Michelle Rodriguez as ... SURPRISE ... a tough as nails soldier who displays heroic instincts. Seen that before? The aliens look like skinny Transformers. The camera work is god-awful. The special effects range from acceptable to laughable. The dialogue is limited to cool things like "look out", "heads-up", "in here", "that's an order" ...But mostly what this one is successful at is NOISE. Lots of noise. Lots of loud noise. So believe me when I scream ... STAY AWAY!

Simply put, this is a great guy movie. My 22 year old nephew and I went to see it and we both loved it. After all, what's not to love? Things blow up almost constantly, and there are only a few minutes during the whole 2 hours that there isn't something either being shot, exploded or burning. If you are worried about character development, plot twists or are looking for a romance film - this is not for you. The characters are perfect for the movie. It's about aliens and the war that happens when they try to take over the world, and specifically LA. Why would you want to waste a lot of time on character development, plot twists or romance in a film about war with extra terrestrials? This film is very much like "Independence Day" in theme. If you like shoot-em-up, blow-em-up, all out non-stop action, this is for you. If you want the other stuff go see a chick flick.

If you've seen "Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen" and liked it, you'll probably like this movie. This film makes a very blatant declaration that it intends to serve entertainment values, not to win an Oscar award for...well, anything. If you want to be wowed by cinematography and director genius, then undoubtedly the jerky camera in action scenes and recycled "war movie" characters will fall flat.If you're looking for a movie whose sole purpose is to deliver Michael Bay-inspired explosions, gunfire, the occasional cheesy inspirational military speech, then go nuts with this and have fun. This film is, in essence, the movie version of the "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare" line.I mean, HONESTLY, if you're looking for entertainment with military realism in terms of jargon and weaponry, then hey why not. But you're warned from here on that this is NOT a film to watch if you're looking for character development, a gut-wrenching plot, and superb script writing.

I found the movie to be superior in nearly every way. From character development to the overall story arc this movie delivered the entire package. Those who call this trite have no idea what they are talking about. The movie just feel 'real'. It pulls the viewer in, grabs hold, and doesn't let go until the very end. I found it to be amazing in nearly every way. I really don't understand why the professional critics are panning this one. It's gritty, in your face, and actually makes sense! Perhaps that's why. Who can say. All I know is I really enjoyed it and will certainly see it again!Go See This Movie!!

I read many of the reviews and have to say to those who were disappointed, what did you expect? How many ways can an alien invasion be done and how many ways can it end for earth or for the invaders?? I took my girlfriend to see this movie and if she fell asleep during it, I know that it wasn't good; she falls asleep in a lot of movies! She didn't sleep through this one at all, and I thought it kept the adrenaline going to the end! I liked the shaky camera work, even liked it in Cloverfield, because it gives a realism to the scenes and increases the urgency. The acting, I thought, was great...given the subject matter, characters were quickly developed and then we got to the meat of it...no long drawn out developments with a horrid rush to the end; this movie was well paced.Battle Los Angeles reminded me of the simplicity of the old SciFi invasion movies, like Earth Verses The Flying Saucers, but blended that with great special effects. I also like that the Aliens were very...Alien! If you are looking to get away from your troubles or just not have to do any thinking, this movie will fit your bill. If you are looking for anything much deeper or some new original theme on an alien invasion, well go make one yourself! The rest of us can just sit back and escape for a while,

I was expecting something along the lines of 2012, Day After Tomorrow, and other cheesy sci-fi movies that are all visual effects and no substance. I came out of the theater surprised that this was actually an awesome war film. Usually I side with film critics on films, but I believe a majority of them got it wrong. It not only had great visuals, but I felt close to the soldiers and airmen that fought in the film. Granted, I am an airmen myself so that might explain the emotional connection with the characters in the film.My one complaint about the film is probably the dialogue. The lines are pretty cookie cutter at times, but the military terminology appeared to me to be spot on.If you like movies such as Blackhawk Down and War of the Worlds, you'll love this movie. I hope they make sequels to either advance the storyline of the war or show a different perspective from another city like New York.

Saw it today in a sneak preview today at the Director's Guild in LA. James Cameron who was there professed it's a masterpiece and the best 3D to date. And he's right on both fronts. The film is exquisitely crafted. The cinematography and set design is likely going to take home a couple gold guys. It's a film lover's dream movie. As with many of Scorsese's films, it's an inspired film history lesson along side of being a dreamlike children's fable. A really unique combination that will work for the film enthusiasts and discerning family's with kids. Maybe a bit long for broad audiences with very little kids, but the images are so enchanting, it should win over most everybody. Sasha Baron Cohen is a brilliant and hilarious standout as the twitchy constable. It should be very well received just on the 3D alone.

I attended the DGA screening over the weekend, followed by a Q&A moderated by James Cameron. Cameron's first words (after correctly referring to Scorsese as "maestro"), were "I thought we'd just geek out over 3D for a half hour, but having seen the movie... it's a masterpiece." I brought my ten year old daughter, who sat -- if anything -- even more transfixed than I did. Every single image is arresting, the use of 3D is perfection itself, the story is engaging and thrilling and heartbreaking and uplifting and I never wanted it to end. If only it'd be three hours! All the performances are excellent, including the kids. Great British actors appear in roles with only a line or two, but it helps lift the movie into the realm of Instant Classic, and Sacha Baron Cohen brings nuance and heart to his humorous role as the Station Inspector. On the way to the car my daughter asked if we could get the blu-ray when it's available, and I had the same feeling as well.

There's no denying that 3D has almost never looked this sharp, but there are plenty of films out there where it doesn't call this much attention to itself; it enhances the cosmetic aspect of the film; it hardly does much for the weak adaptation of the novel. In "Hugo", as it is the case in many of the of Scorcese's films, technological improvements throw his film out of balance, and this is the beginning of the many flaws in this project.The art direction and costumes are breathtaking, immersing the audience in the right period, though it has barely any of the charm and magic that made another film set Paris this year so successful. In that other film, all the scenes in the various periods are evocative and involving. Here the experience is as cold as a disorganized display in the best museum. It doesn't have much impact on its audience. Some of the scenery could be an exact imitation of the original inspiration. There were a couple of times when the visuals blend perfectly with a few of the clips that are integrated in the film.The problem is the almost absolute lack of warmth in the various relationships between many of the main characters and the way they are directed in this movie. The young man at the heart of the film feels at time as another piece of furniture in the set. When I walked into the theater, many of the people weren't sure if we were watching an animated film or a live action production because they said the actors looked funny. The feel feels so cold in its adaptation of a very interesting literary piece, a book so charming with its integration of words and its simple black and white adaptation. To be fair it is hard to look away because it is so gorgeous, but at the same time, the disappointment hits hard because this is a film that should relies heavily in the sense of wonder usually associated with children's films and/or young performers. Earlier this year "Super 8" and "Real Steel" benefited immensely from the outstanding work and charisma of their young performers. The Elle Fanning scene in "Super 8" puts everything in this film to shame. Where both of those films project warmth, innocence,and a great variety of emotions, "Hugo" never becomes multidimensional, a big irony, considering its best quality is the nearly perfect 3-D visuals. To make things worse, two other projects involving literacy and story telling, made by Cuaron ("A Little Princess") and Petersen ("The Never Ending Story") have shown that its is possible to blend reality and magic, with the help of the right approach and the appropriate performances.In addition to the lack of emotional magic on the screen, the pacing in "Hugo" is so slow it borders on catatonic, dragging for most of its two hours. We finally arrive to the last third of the film, a place where the film finally comes alive; suddenly, Scorcese pours his heart in the film, using original film clips and beautiful recreations of the original sources from various classic films of early French cinema. These are breathtaking, as they play, one after another, showing us the sense of wonder original audiences must have experienced. Finally, one is almost overpowered as Toto was in several scenes of "Cinema Paradiso" as the director viewed the treasured collage in the final scene of that movie, or as the young protagonist of "A Little Princess" told her magic stories set in exotic India, infused with her own imagination and simple stop motion work. Petersen went even further with the seamless blend of the young man, as he becomes a part of the literary experience, and one realized how powerful the magic in the written word can be. Very little of that exists in "Hugo", a shiny package, with a rock for a heart.Scorcese has done much for the preservation of cinema, and the original source of this film lent itself to a cinematic production to support his cause, but just like Spielberg chooses other people to direct some of his projects, much more could have been achieved by handing this property to a more suited director, a person who understands innocence, wonder, how important it is to get inside the hearts of people, opposed to working with projects where the main characters are notorious for not having one. Rarely Scorcese has shown in his movies any sort of affection for or between his characters, "Alice doesn't live here anymore" is a rare exception, and children in it are a bit on the precocious side. Come to think about it, Law showed much more emotion in "A.I." as he interacted with the marvelous Osment, and both of them were playing automatons.A big disappointment.

What Martin Scorcese has managed to do is add story dimensionality to a family film that has 3D technology. Some of the dimensions he's included which don't always make into Hollywood blockbusters are an imaginative and original concept, thematic unity and resonance and deft homage to film itself, in the story of Georges Méliès, French film pioneer.Saw the film in an advance screening and we were among the many there who were obviously not standard family film consumers. This being a Scorcese film is likely to bring lots of adults to Hugo and I would think many of them, like me, will feel the film stands up as entertainment for all age groups.I especially enjoyed the resonance and intricacy of the theme of clocks, clockworks, animatronics and "the ghost in the machine"--our fear, in the post industrial age that perhaps we are just a rather complex machine, rather than a divine creation. This is all beautifully rendered cinematically. I doubt the little ones will be bewildered while older viewers can pick out levels and layers in the film.Good fun and visually interesting throughout. The 3D is used in service of the story. I hope Hollywood is watching and notices that special effects are only special when they get the heart of the machine working, like Hugo's little man.

I saw Hugo at a free screening in SF (thanks SFFS!) last night. It was not what I expected and was really...wonderful. My middle schooler and highschooler knew the story. They say that the movie was much better than the original story. From the trailer, I thought it was going to be a movie for kids with lots of 3D twists and turns. Instead, I got a beautifully sentimental story about the wonder of film and about our potential to be healed from past hurts. This really isn't a typical kid movie. I think my 8 year old and 10 year old would have liked it but I don't think they would understand what it was really about. The pacing and character development is really more like an old Capra movie than a modern Disney or most Pixar movies. My 12 year old thought it was good and I think my 16 year old really liked it. I thought Hugo was a lovely movie for anyone who enjoys film.

This movie will definitely go down as a children's/family classic. I couldn't help but get the same vibe I used to get while watching family films from the 80s and 90s...something that has been missing in films IMO from 2000-2010 (as far as live action films go).To be honest, this film felt like a very very good Spielberg film. I'm not a die hard fan who over analyzes Scorsese's work (meaning I don't know what his signature director "trademarks" art, or rather what filming techniques are unique to him), and if the film was credited to Spielberg I'd believe it. That's not to say Scorsese is a bad director. He's a living legend. This just happens to be virgin ground for him...directing and producing a children's/family movie. And the movie happens to be just as good/on par with, if not better than, a solid Spielberg film.Best Picture winner? Maybe not, but will definitely be a nominee. There are a lot of independent films that have been released this year that will surely get recognized, and there still are a couple films yet to be released that will get recognized by the academy.Best supporting actor nomination for Ben Kingsley? Definitely. Will he get his second Oscar? I hope so. He was fantastic in the movie and it's the only other role he's ever played other than Gandhi where he was totally dissolved into the character he was playing. In other films, perhaps it was bad writing or bad characters that didn't let him show his true potential as an actor. Or maybe I just haven't seen enough of his films. Regardless, this is the best I've seen him since Richard Attenborough's Gandhi.Is the 3D worth it? Definitely, but only at decent modern theaters. I saw Tron Legacy at an older theater last year and the 3D there was just awful...images were blurry, dark, etc. I saw it first at an Imax Digital 3D theater and it was amazing (the 3D and the picture quality). At my local theater, which was renovated about 10+ years ago I believe, the image quality for Hugo in 3D was superb. Only the dark scenes were a bit off-putting, and only because for some reason my eyes were seeing both images separately instead of together as a stereoscopic image. Most of the movie is bright and colorful though which made the 3D very nice.I don't suppose seeing this in 2D would hurt the overall experience though. But, the 3D in this film was very immersive. Similar to how Avatar was. Plus, it was filmed in 3D and is how the film was intended to be seen. Just to see the insides of a clock tower and train station in 3D is a real treat IMO.Plot holes? Some early reviews I read suggested there was some, but I didn't catch any (or rather, I only noticed one and it was very very minor). The only thing that the film was lacking was a little more character development for the supporting and background actors, but they weren't major characters and weren't really that important to the story (since the story was focusing on Hugo and Ben Kingsley's characters almost entirely). There was one plot hole I suppose, but it doesn't really matter and isn't distracting. The plot hole involves Hugo's uncle, who appears in the first half of the film to be Hugo's guardian, the station's clock mechanic (who makes sure all the clocks are working properly and are on time), and an alcoholic. After he is introduced, he quickly vanishes from the film until the last half hour.Is this film Scorsese's masterpiece? I don't know if I'd go that far, since it definitely isn't his best or most powerful film. But if you want to call it a "family-film masterpiece", and not Scorsese's best, then I'd agree with you.Sacha Baron Cohen's character... Kind of weird seeing him in a family film considering his filmography, but he wasn't distracting and fit in well as comic-relief, sometimes villainous, and was believable as a quirky French train station officer.I gave the film a solid 9/10. Not a perfect 10 because there were some flaws...but only in the character development (of supporting/minor characters).ALSO! One thing I loved about the film was how there were a few short scenes and segments showing Hugo watching the people in the train station go about their daily routines. Many of these scenes almost looked as if they were re-enactments of old silent films...just as Sacha's character trying to sum up the courage to talk to a woman he likes, or an older man trying to woo a similarly aged woman but her dog doesn't like him and is hostile to him, the ridiculous chase sequence between Sacha and Hugo, etc. It's almost as if all the scenes in the film not directly related to the plot were montages (or homages) of silent film plots. And they were all pleasant and amusing to watch.Anyway, go see this film. It's a very pleasant film. It also employs a lot of themes as well, probably the most prominent is the theme of honoring past filmmakers and preserving their work so they can survive the ages. The whole part about Ben Kingsley's character having made hundreds of films only to have burned all of his master copies to get extra cash, living his life believing that all of his life's work gone forever was just...well...sad and depressing. Even sadder is the fact that it's based on a true story.All in all this is a very lovely film. Has a lot of charm to it. There is no doubt in my mind that it will go down as a classic.

Saw the movie at an advance screening with my friends. The first hour and half of the movie is quite boring. The visuals are good, sets are amazing but the movie lacks the pace. The trailer looks like the movie for the kids but I think they will feel bored watching the movie because it is a family sentimental drama. I am a great fan of Martin Scorsese films but this one is not quite good as his other films. The kids Asa Butterfield and Chloë Grace Moretz did an amazing job and Ben Kingsley is superb. I don't think these kind of drama films need 3D. I could have enjoyed this film more in 2D than 3D. But here and there there are couple of good 3D visuals. If you like a good family sentimental drama film with slow pace then go and watch it, otherwise skip it.

Without spoiling, consider a motion picture whose last 30 minutes are equal to the last 4 minutes of Cinema Paradiso. To be in a theater with people tearing up over images of vintage and historic cinema, so beautifully integrated into a dazzling and heartfelt story is something special indeed. Absolutely knock-out use of 3D, fantastic performances by everyone involved, glorious set design, music, costumes and state -of-the-art CGI that propel a story rather than being superficial, stand alone tricks makes HUGO a film for moviegoers world wide. Absolutely do not miss this film in a theater. The images are transporting and need to be experienced on the big screen.Thanks Marty, for bringing to us all such a gift. This is truly one for the ages

-- Ramascreen.com --HUGO is a refreshing, wondrous detour for Scorsese. It's not one of my top favorite Scorsese films of all time but it works as a family movie. I can imagine the great director just having fun with this material and the 3D aspects, he's like a kid in a candy store, not to mention it gives him the chance to pay homage to silent films and his love of cinema in general. HUGO is for those of us who find escape in the world of movies I've never read the best seller that became the basis for this movie but when I heard that it has a bit to do with an orphan and the story is somewhat of a period piece, I thought we were in for another version of Oliver Twist-type story. And perhaps certain elements of HUGO would give some people that impression. HUGO's set design, the visual, the 3D, the costume, the cinematography, everything about the environment is both marvelous and captivating. A while back I thought this kind of film should be better handled by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director who brought us 2001′s Amelie, but Scorsese proves that he too can deliver something that wildly imaginative and magical. One of the most visually arresting films in recent years. Some of the best scenes I enjoy in HUGO are the ones that deal with the silent films. To watch Kingsley and McCrory re-enact some of those films is a delight.The first half of the story loses my interest, partially because I feel that the father-son relationship is a bit rushed and I find the interaction between Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and Isabelle (Chloe Moretz) not engaging enough but I warm up to it after the heart-shaped key comes into play, my curiosity kicks in high gear from that point on. Chloe Moretz's accent goes on and off but her character is so friendly and supportive, you quickly dismiss her tough attempt on the accent. The design they have for the automoton, the mechanic figure that can write, is nothing short of fascinating. I wonder if I could put that on my Christmas wish list this year, it'd be cool to own one.I think it's appropriate to have the great chameleon actor Ben Kingsley portray who many consider to be one of the fathers of early cinema, Georges Méliès. As Méliès, Kingsley makes you see that the spark in his eyes and the excitement in his heart, his belief in dreams have long gone. Hugo's little sad story leads to a discovery of a grand story that opens the door to a celebrated past.Nothing is left hanging in this film, every character has a purpose and each purpose connects with one another. Even the ruthless station inspector, well played by Sacha Baron Cohen, who hunts down orphans as part of his job, has depth and he, of all people, should understand what Hugo is going through because he's a grown result of the resentment over the system that he wants to throw Hugo into. I think the 3 big key characters here are Hugo Cabret, Méliès and the Station inspector and they collide perfectly in this cinematic enchantment straight from the heart of Martin Scorsese.-- Ramascreen.com --

Martin Scorsese creates a world in Hugo, it has the exact same feel as the book did a couple years ago. Brilliant cinematography, excellent acting, humorous at times, sad at times, and the music was perfect. Scorsese's world is a world you don't want to leave. From watching gears turn in the inside of a clock to a mechanical man drawing a picture, Hugo is just plain brilliant. It's one of the few movies where the 3D actually works, it adds to the effects, to the cinematography, it's not just a gimmick to appeal to the masses, it helps the whole feel. The camera shots were excellent using many shots that you don't see often in movies. Hugo is a magical movie for kids and adults.

Director Martin Scorsese has delivered the ultimate tribute to film making in HUGO from Paramount Pictures. The story dives into the real life of pioneer silent film maker Georges Melies (Sir Ben Kingsley) who made films between the years 1896 to 1913. "Hugo" is the name of a young orphaned boy (Asa Butterfield)in Paris, France in 1931 living inside a train station's clock and crosses paths with Melies who now works at a toy shop inside the train station when he catches Hugo stealing.Hugo's quest to discover a message from his deceased father (played by Jude Law), who was a clock repairman, lies in a mystery left behind in the workings of his Dad's greatest project – a mechanical doll, or "automata". Through his journey, Hugo enlists the help of Melies' adopted daughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) The operation of the automata leads Hugo and Isabelle to uncover another mystery, this one with Papa Georges whom they soon find out is a great film maker now in hiding.It couldn't be more appropriate that legendary film maker Martin Scorsese re-awakens the beauty in the art of film making with "Hugo" to remind us of how it all got started with a tribute to the re-invention of film making in 3D. A technology first for Scorsese.The visuals of the movie and brown sepia tones along with the 3D effect makes it look like a combination of typical Scorsese style but at times with the 3D it also looks like a beautiful pop-up book. There are many strong human scenes in Hugo that are signature Scorsese. One particular scene was when Papa Georges caught Hugo and Isabelle snooping through his old movie drawings. In actor Kingsley's hurt reaction, "I trusted you. You're just crueljust cruel" there viewers can see the Scorsese stamp in revealing of the character's soul through the actor, the same style seen in "Good Fellas", "Casino", "The Age of Innocence" just to name a few.The characters in the train station are ultimately connected to one another that all tie-back to the discovery of the message revealed in the automata. Their fight against being alone ultimately unites them all in the end. Even Hugo's worst enemy, the station inspector, humorously played by Sacha Baron Cohen, who is constantly hunting him and other orphaned children to send to the orphanage find a common bond.The most touching part of "Hugo" is the re-introduction of film and how it all started. At a time where technology has moved us so far along into the digital age, this movie is a much welcomed tribute to the pioneers of film making. A Montague of mile stones of early film included: silent film actress Clara Bow, 1903 film "The Great Train Robbery", and Melies movie, "A Trip to the Moon". No details were left out – the glass sets that were used to shoot-in in order to light with the sun, the hand-crank projectors, the old way of cutting and gluing film pieces together in editing, and hand-painting film before color film was invented! "Hugo" is a must-see for any lover of film! Scorsese also worked-in the message of film preservation in a few scenes. Since founding The Film Foundation in 1990 Scorsese's name has become synonymous with film preservation in his accomplishments to save great, worthy films of the past.Hugo's dad said it best in his reaction after watching "A Trip to the Moon", "it was like dreaming in the middle of the day". "Hugo" defines the magic in film making and telling the story of what happens when people follow their dreams as well as the consequences it brings – good or bad."Hugo" opens in theaters Wednesday, November 2011 in 3D.www.HollywoodJunket.com

So I saw this film today, and I was blown away. I'll admit that the trailer didn't impress me much, and if you do come out of it thinking that Hugo is just for kids, it's not. It's so much more than that. I had heard of Martin Scorsese directing a 3-D picture, but I didn't realize it was this very adaptation. The book was a wonderful experience (go read it - the pictures within are like a film by itself!), and I can't believe I didn't think the 3-D medium would work for it.Absolutely brilliant. From the very first scene, you get a sense of how Scorsese is able to tap into the charm of 3-D - the essence of it - which is so easily lost amidst the abundance of films that get slapped with the 3-D label, but in a less cash-greedy industry need not warrant the extra surcharge. Scorsese takes his time to immerse the audience in Paris, in the train station, in Hugo's everyday surroundings that may seem almost ordinary to him by this point but for us, it's a whole different world. At times I forgot I was watching a live-action film because some of it was just so vibrant (yes, even with the automatic dimming of your 3-D glasses).The cast was wonderful - Asa Butterfield as the main lead, has got such expressive eyes that you feel the hurt when he thinks of his father (played by Jude Law), which is very often. Chloe Moretz partners him very well as a fellow adventurer, and of course, you've also got: Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helen McCrory, etc. to round out the characters.It's such a fantastical but genuine story that you can't help but fall in love with it, I think. Scorsese has brought a boy's dream to life but also written a love letter to film-making. I won't spoil anything outside of the trailer for fear of diminishing the magic, but I needed to write a somewhat coherent review to get my thoughts down, and hopefully persuade more people to watch the film! There's heart, there's magic, there's wonder, there's enjoyment, there's a little bit of everything for everyone to love in this. Some parts had me misty-eyed with the wonderful score and the ode to the joy of film.And I know the mandatory 3-D will deter people but this film is one of those rare ones (and at the moment the only film so far this year that I can think of) that extols the virtue of 3-D. I WEAR GLASSES SO I HAVE TO PUT 3-D GLASSES OVER MY OWN PAIR AND I WASN'T ANNOYED AT ALL - IT WAS WELL WORTH IT. So I'm speaking for that crowd right now. I know there are plenty of us out there! The genius of Scorsese strikes here, so pop in and have an adventure. :)

I just returned home after seeing Hugo on opening day and if I can describe this film in one word, it would be beautiful. This film has inspired me in ways that I can't even begin to explain. It's been a while since I've seen a film that spoke to me as personally as this film did. I'm a fan of Martin Scorsese and he's crafted a beautiful ode to not only cinema but also imagination and in a way, it celebrates all the things that help us escape. The world is a scary place and everyone goes through pain and suffering but if you just try and learn to dream, find your voice and not be afraid then you would be surprised what could happen.I love how this film tells the amazing story of pioneer filmmaker Georges Melies who many of today's directors such as Steven Spielberg and James Cameron owe everything to. I love his films and I own a box set of his work, it's wonderful to see more people be introduced to him and the magic he created that continues to capture the imagination of many.So if you love the cinema and magic then I highly recommend this masterpiece. Hugo is really something special I think.

Hugo is wonderful and beautiful, filled with drama, fantasy, adventure, passion, excitement and mystery. This film is an enchanting grown-up movie that I loved - and my 7-year old enjoyed throughout. (There is nothing objectionable for kids, but some younger children might get bored during certain parts). Neither my young son nor I is a fan of 3D, but Hugo used 3D technology beautifully and subtly. It complemented the film perfectly. The characters in Hugo are well-developed and complex. The acting was universally excellent. The movie is gorgeously filmed - fitting in a movie that, among other things, is also about an extraordinary love and celebration of film-making. Martin Scorsese has made a tour de force with this film.

Upon seeing the trailer for "Hugo", I wasn't overly impressed. The blaring emphasis on 3D made me worried it was more spectacle than substance. Still, it was directed by Martin Scorsese, and had Ben Kingsley in it, so I decided to put aside my fears and go see it anyway.Am I ever glad I did! This is a sweet and gentle tale, full of unexpected warmth and depth. It is the story of Hugo Cabret, an orphan and keeper of the clocks at a train station in Paris. His only connection to his deceased father is a broken-down automaton the two were repairing before his father's demise in a fire. When Hugo is caught stealing parts for the automaton by the old owner of a toy shop in the station (Kingsley), his booklet of sketches related to the curious mechanical man is taken from him. Attempting to retrieve it, he meets Isabelle, the goddaughter of the aged man. Together, they begin to unravel the mystery behind Kingsley's character and help bring his true identity to light. (It shouldn't be that much of a surprise to anyone with knowledge of early film history that has a chance to look at the cast list here on IMDb. Does the name "Georges Méliès" ring any bells?) Asa Butterfield does capably in the title role, and Chloe Grace Moretz shines sublimely as the precocious Isabelle. Of course, Ben Kingsley gives a terrific performance, powerful and poignant. He plays a broken man anguished by the shadows of the past.These three are the central figures of the film, yet the side characters are handled equally well. That really struck me. A lesser filmmaker might have let such characters come off as just caricatures, especially in a children's film. Scorsese doesn't allow for that to happen. Richard Griffiths', Frances de la Tour's and Christopher Lee's characters are all skillfully imbued with humanity so that the audience feels for them and seems to get to know them in spite of their short periods on screen. Even Sacha Baron Cohen's silly Station Inspector is more than a one-dimensional figure. In between his cartoonish antics and chases after Hugo, he is shown to be painfully shy, pining desperately for the affections of an attractive woman who sells flowers. We learn also that he was wounded in World War I, and that it was his days growing up without love in the strict environment of an orphanage that so embittered him towards the world. He is not merely some comic antagonist tossed in for the sake of slapstick. Instead, he is a fascinating and well-developed character in his own right. One feels compassion and pity for him, and hopes he will have the courage to speak up and win the heart of his love, that their quirky relationship will blossom into romance.In short, this is a simply lovely film. There has been some uproar and befuddlement over the director of such films as "Taxi Driver" and "Goodfellas" making a 'children's movie'. I must admit I was a little abashed myself upon first hearing it. But "Hugo" shows that a so-called children's movie doesn't have to be inane or infantile. This is an intelligent and wondrous work – never sappy or banal. In part a tribute to the magic of cinema, it reminded me why I love motion pictures so much. With its richness and nuance, "Hugo" should appeal to children and adults alike. I realize that saying sounds a little clichéd, but in this case I have faith in the truth of it.

Something unfortunate happens when directors decide to celebrate their love of the cinema. They end up celebrating themselves and their own fannish sensibilities, and their movies turn all mawkish. That's what happened in Truffaut's smug DAY FOR NIGHT and Tornatore's treacly CINEMA PARADISO, and it's what happens here. Ostensibly an expression of Scorsese's infatuation with film, it's really an example of his self-infatuation. HUGO is undeniably beautiful to look at, with sumptuous atmospheric sets and elaborate shots from high overhead or down long corridors -- trust me, miles and miles of corridors -- expressly designed to make maximum use the 3-D camera. But the story itself is glum and painfully slow. Around me audience members kept yawning, and they stirred restlessly in their seats whenever a character launched into another interminable nostalgic reminiscence. (I felt especially sorry for the kids, for whom the film had to be a letdown.) Too many scenes are as earnest and didactic as a museum lecture on the early history of cinema.Although HUGO's got a splendid cast, the characters struck me as formulaic and lifeless; it's like watching one of those motion-capture Bob Zemeckis movies, such as THE POLAR EXPRESS or A Christmas CAROL, populated by figures not entirely human who resemble animated Chris Van Allsburg illustrations. (The film's very distinctive look is in fact pure Van Allsburg -- a mixed blessing. Everything we see is gorgeous, but it all looks fake, like the expensive film set it is. Eventually the artificiality grows tiresome.) I've always loved Georges Melies's wonderful silent fantasies, and it's commendable that Scorsese is reminding modern audiences, via this movie, just how inventive, magical, and ahead-of-their-time they were. But somehow the sheer self-congratulatory reverence that Scorsese lavishes on those old films made me long for a simple unpretentious documentary.

Spoiler alert - don't read this review if you haven't seen the film, BUT see Hugo!.I've started up a small business making desks that work for people. For me, as for many in the same boat, this is a delicate time and a rough one.My wife and I took the afternoon off today and saw Hugo.It re-affirmed my faith in humanity.I came out of the cinema crying with joy, knowing that it really is OK to fix things, to make them work!The story is beautifully told, beautifully acted and directed.This is that rare thing, a perfect film.Thank you Martin Scorsese and everyone involved.

The movie is visually beautiful. But was dragging all along until the last 30 minutes. There was an overbearing effort to make the viewer feel very sentimental. The background score was very monotonous and boring. The intent of the story and the idea behind is good and Ben Kingsley and the kids have done a good job. But somehow the viewer doesn't feel the despair the boy feels, Not because of his acting, but because the dialogues were not convincing. The relationship between its characters are not well developed. Only in the last 30 minutes there were some pace to the story. Watch it if you are a Scorsese fan or nothing else to do.

The genius of Martin Scorcese's "Hugo" is not just that it employs the latest in filmmaking technology, but that it employs them in a story about how filmmaking itself came to be. This is a subject near and dear to Scorcese, who, apart from directing and producing, is renowned for his work as a film historian (he's the co-founder of The Film Foundation and the World Cinema Foundation, both nonprofit organizations dedicated to the preservation of film). He doesn't present history so much as immerse us in it, and not in a way that's distant or clinical but rather in a way that's warm and inviting. He beckons us with the art of illusion, gets us interested in the mechanics, and allows us to study them up close. In that process of revelation, never once does the magic elude us."Hugo," adapted from Brian Selznick's novel "The Invention of Hugo Cabret," is an absolute triumph, not just of plot, but of casting, performance, character development, art direction, set design, special effects, and theme as well. It's also one of the best looking 3D films I've ever seen, and if you've read my reviews, you know how I feel about 3D in general. Rather than assault our field of vision with crude pop out gags, Scorcese allows the process to envelope us like a blanket, making us at one with the world he has created. We're not watching the story unfold; we're actually a part of it. There are times when I wanted to reach out and try to touch the images, for they were so well integrated into the shots that they achieved an uncanny tactile quality. For the first time ever, I'm recommending you spend the extra money for a 3D movie, especially if your local theater uses digital projectors that allow for bright, clear pictures.Taking place in Paris sometime in the early 1930s, it tells the story of Hugo (Asa Butterfield), an orphaned boy who lives within the walls of a train station. As the son of a watchmaker (Jude Law in a flashback sequence), he has an affinity for clockwork and mechanical creations, which is why he keeps himself busy by winding all the station's clocks. His secret lair is a world of iron, gears, pendulums, springs, and steam. He observes the everyday hustle and bustle through various openings, usually clock faces. He sees Monsieur Frick, the newspaper vendor (Richard Griffiths), trying to woo the café owner, Madame Emile (Francis de la Tour), while simultaneously trying to avoid her irritable dog. He sees a flower girl named Lisette (Emily Mortimer), who cheerfully sets up shop every morning. He desperately tries to avoid the mean, crippled station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), who, along with his Rottweiler, rounds up unattended children and has them shipped off to the orphanage.Before he died in a fire, Hugo's father was trying to repair a metal automaton, which he found rusting away in a museum. Hugo, determined to finish the work his father started, runs afoul of a bitter, reserved man known as Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), whose assortment of windup figures has the gears Hugo needs. Georges, who knows Hugo has been stealing from him, is shocked when he discovers a notebook Hugo's father sketched in. He then takes it and refuses to return it. He even threatens to burn it. Hugo must get it back. Here enters Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), who quickly becomes Hugo's friend. Well read and adventurous, Isabelle wears a heart-shaped key around her neck – the same key that fits a special lock on Hugo's automaton. Why does she have it? And what will happen once the automaton has been wound up?Alas, I cannot describe the rest of the film without becoming annoyingly vague. What a shame that I'm unable to reveal how all this connects to the art of filmmaking. All I can say is, Scorcese does a masterful job of depicting what it must have been like in those early days of movies, in which it was evident that not even the limits of technology could put a damper on the imagination. We see boundless creativity in gaudy costumes, plywood sets, and celluloid that has been hand tinted frame by frame. We study first generation cameras and projectors and marvel at their hand-operated mechanisms. Best of all, we see audiences staring in awe as pictures, projected on a white screen, actually move.Every character is so engaging and richly developed that I couldn't possibly praise them all. This would not have been possible were it not for the spot-on casting. As Hugo, Butterfield is sympathetic but not manipulative – a Dickensian character capable of real emotions. Moretz is just plain charming as plucky young Isabelle, and Kingsley shows great range as Georges. The biggest surprise is Cohen as the station inspector, who we expect will be little more than a traditional cross between a frightening menace and comedy relief. We would be wrong; as he nervously makes passes at Lisette, we begin to see a real person, a man who has yet to process his misfortunes in life in a healthy, constructive way. As a historical fable, and as a celebration of the cinematic arts, "Hugo" is a treasure.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)

"If you've ever wondered where your dreams come from, just look around. This is where they're made."Hugo Cabret's story was told so well that it felt like you were right there with him on his stunning adventure.For those unfamiliar, this is the story about a young boy named Hugo. He lives inside the walls of a train station in Paris in the 1930's. His father dies, leaving behind a mysterious automaton that, when fixed, can write. Hugo makes it his mission to fix it, believing that it will reveal a message from his father. With the help of an eccentric girl named Isabelle, he tries to uncover a magical mystery about the old man at the toy booth (Isabelle's godfather) and enchanting early films.I had been looking forward to this film for a very long time, and I was not disappointed at all. I was a bit unsure about the 3D at first, but it turned out to be superb. Every single object became part of the story, and the audience became immersed in this beautiful world created by Martin Scorsese and Brian Selznick. While every member of the cast was brilliant, there are two in particular I'd like to point out. First, Asa Butterfield as Hugo. He carried the film with perfection and gave a truly incredible performance. His acting was very natural--you could hardly tell he was acting! He did an amazing job of bringing life to a complex, lost, sad character. Asa is one of the most talented young actors I've ever seen; a very likely Oscar nomination in his future. Last (but certainly not least) is Chloe Grace Moretz. She is another young performer that never fails to amaze me. Chloe nailed the British accent and brilliantly portrayed a bright, energetic Isabelle. This movie has it all: beautiful visuals, super-talented cast, magic, love, heart, feeling, emotion. Best Picture Nomination for sure, and quite possibly others. Overall, this movie is a must-see. It was the most enjoyable theater experience that I've ever had. The entire theater broke into applause once it ended. This film has something for all ages, and it's really something special. Especially if you love adventure, mystery, wonder, and have a bright imagination, you will fall in love with this film just like I did."Come and dream with me."

Saw Hugo at the Arclight Hollywood last night. This is a wonderful film, the best that I have seen in years.See it in 3-D as it is the best example of 3-D that I have seen.This is a film that adults will enjoy. Most important is that it is Martin Scorsese's love letter to cinema. If you love cinema and its history, you must see Hugo.Whether the film succeeds financially or not, is not important, its still a masterpiece.Future generations of young moviegoers will finally learn something about the history of cinema.

Here in Richmond, we have the privilege of viewing movies in a top notch place called The Bow Tie Cinemas. Going to the movies is still an "experience" at The Bow Tie, and all viewers alike go just for that. Tonight was no exception to say the least. My brother and I had been seeing the previews for this movie, and from the start we both were completely awestruck by how incredible it looked from the trailer itself. Well, let me tell you, we were NOT disappointed. AT ALL. This movie was everything that a movie should be. The cast was perfectly picked, the acting spot-on, and the cinematography was beyond articulate. Ben Kingsley played his character to the "T", and both Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz were surprisingly splendid. I say surprisingly because the acting I witnessed from these two kids was nothing short of brilliance; something you don't witness everyday with young actors/actresses. We were lucky enough to view it in 3D, and that just made it all the better. I don't like reviewing movies just to completely summarize the movie like so many people on here do. I am reviewing it so that you can know what to expect. And what you should expect from this movie is sheer perfection. SOLID 10/10

I totally lost interest in the movie when the automaton stop writing and the boy lost his temper. That was the wrong emotion for a very determined, very mechanical boy. The natural emotion would be raw determination. He would start working immediately to get the automaton working again. He wouldn't have abandoned his determination after being so determined up to that point. He would have worked himself into exhaustion and despair after hours of trying everything. Then, something very unusual (surprise me here) would happen to make it start drawing again. This is just another Martin Scorsese movie that poorly tells a story. So what is so brilliant about Martin Scorsese.

If you wonder why Martin Scorsese (delving into Tim Burton territory) chose to direct a "children's story" of a young orphan living inside of – and surreptitiously working the clocks of – a tower in a Paris train station just wait for the second half: when the somewhat slow-paced but beautifully shot contained journey turns into a whimsical celebration of one of the greatest innovators of cinema. But that's another story – making this feel like two tales in one.The first has our young hero, straight out of a Dickens novel, named Hugo Cabret with only the memories of his deceased father, who left behind an automaton robot that needs a heart-shaped key to make it run: perhaps providing a message from beyond. Enter the granddaughter of an old and bitter toy dealer; she has the key needed – but leading to this point is a somewhat thin story stretched out too long.On the peripheral, and making up the comedy, action, and suspense is the station inspector played by Sacha Baron Cohen, doing a somewhat tongue-in-cheek nod to clumsy silent film antagonists. With a Doberman at his side, the lone keystone cop strives to catch the young tinkerer: whose only goal is to get that automaton working.Then the second half – after a crucial discovery – is where Scorsese's true aim lies. But with the built-up mystery gone, the youthful awe is only partially replaced by a cinematic history lesson more dreamlike than fact based.The young star Asa Butterfield, with sad eyes and a curiously insightful expression, while looking the part makes for a somewhat bland title character. But it's Chloë Grace Moretz, as his lovely young sidekick, that not only brightens the film with her tremendous acting but whose bookworm dreamer yearns for adventure more than Scorsese's film delivers it.Yet despite the flaws, there's enough residual magic for (creative) kids and (patient) adults to enjoy.For More Reviews: http://cultfilmfreakreviews.blogspot.com

Last night, after much waiting and anticipation for Martin Scorsese's new picture, "Hugo," I must say the film not only met my expectations, but very thoroughly surpassed them. I fell in love with this film, and haven't been able to stop thinking about it, so I had to write a review.I must stress, that this will be a SHORT, and very simple review, for the sake of avoiding spoilers and not rambling on too much about the film. (and it is also my first review)From a technical standpoint, the film is excellent. As usual, Scorsese's eye behind the camera is marvelous,as he guides you through the movie's story with much expertise. From the start of the film, you feel as if you are in a new world as the camera takes you through the walls of a Paris train station, as you are introduced to the home and life of our lead character, Hugo Cabret. The movie looks and feels amazing! It truly does feel like a different world. It is amazing to think that something as simple as a train station, can be transformed into something so magical and beautiful. The look of this busy train station that we are given is quite compelling, and extremely well fabricated.The films splendid use of colors and lighting is also very crucial to the tone that the film creates.(*NOTE*: for anyone who is debating whether or not to watch the film in 3D, I wouldn't spend the extra money. There were some creative shots that really stood out with the 3D, but other than just a FEW, select moments, it really is not necessary to watch in 3D) The characters in the film are also a work all their own. Each of them serve an important purpose to the movie's story, and all the characters are genuine and deep, which is necessary for the film to work.The movie simply took hold of my imagination, and reminded me about the importance of never forgetting who you are, what you love, and to never let go of your dreams.I strongly recommend this picture to anyone, I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed. Overall, I give Hugo a perfect 10, and it is by far my favorite movie of the year.

Hugo a small kid lives in the walls of a busy Paris train station, where his survival depends on secrets and anonymity. But when his world suddenly interlocks with an eccentric girl and the owner of a small toy booth in the train station, Hugo's undercover life, and his most precious secret, are put in jeopardy.this 3D family-friendly Movie, kid-oriented fantasy film, Martin Scorsese has executed one of his periodic 180-degree about turns: comparable to his 19th-century costume drama The Age of Innocence, or Kundun, his encomium to the Dalai Lama. In Hugo, nobody gets called a "fuckin", no one's head gets crushed in a vice, no one's body gets buried in the desert outside Las Vegas. Instead, Scorsese has gone all Harry Potter on us, creating an intricately designed and beautifully rendered story aimed squarely at that fabled (and commercially invaluable) point at which childlike fantasy intersects with adult yearning.I don't want to give spoilers, for that I highly recommend this movie for everyone, want to see a good piece of cinema.To download this film or others immediately Blueray or DVDjust Google: "real-steel-mediafire" and look for a website which starts with: hotHave a nice watching!

Wasn't so excited about seeing this film from viewing the trailer as; I couldn't imagine Scorsese as a director of a "family film", but I was gleefully amazed, surprised....and "blown away" by everything about this film, the acting, the beauty of the cinematography, the story....everything !! Scorsese's genius shines through as he is able to evoke such raw emotion in a unique way through the telling of this story. I hope this is just the beginning of Scorsese discovering a new genre for his films as; it only solidified my respect for him as a filmmaker. If you have any doubts (and it's not just for kids), you should dispel them and go see. You won't be disappointed .

Someone compared this movie to a Hans Christian Andersen tale and I think this is about as good a comparison as it gets. Some people find it boring and painful, others are mesmerized and inspired by the story it tells and the way it does so. In short, if you prefer Disney's version of the little mermaid story, you will likely be disappointed by Hugo.On the other hand, if you like the attention to detail and the not entirely happy endings of Andersen's classic short stories, you will probably find that Hugo is a captivating film that is hard to describe in a few words. It really lives in a lot more than three dimensions.If you also happen to be a cinema fan, you will love it even more. What is a cinema fan? It's person that appreciates films for more than just their entertainment value. The way movies are made, the different layers of audio, visuals, emotions, symbols, the photography, the standout supporting casts, the way you can predict the cliché moves sometimes, but love it anyway. We love the good movies, like the bad ones, and films like Hugo make our hearts sing.One last note on the use of 3D. I usually avoid 3D versions of movies because that feature has not yet proved itself to be more than just a gimmick. In Hugo's case, it is still partially true. I watched it in 3D and the opening sequence in the train station as well as a couple other select shots were exceptionally staged for 3D. Aside from that though, you get used to the effect and thankfully, it's the story that stays in the center of attention, followed by beautiful cinematography, characters, and 3D is trailing humbly behind. If you have the opportunity, watch the 3D version, but you will not really love it in 2D any less.

Thanks to Spielberg who could so well carry it with his amazing technique of motion capturing rather action capturing where he moves the camera along with the protagonist on the screen. Beautifully manifested Hugo couldn't have received a warmer welcome to the film industry.I am a big fan of Hugo comics and of course the animated series as well, especially the unrelenting Uncle Claude and who could forget the amazing duos Thompson and Thomson with their clumsy behavior who always managed to giggle me every now and then. Hugo and Uncle Claude however used to be my heroes solving mysteries and defying danger at every step. When I found out that there was going to be a movie and none other than Martin eScorses was gonna direct it, I was more than elated and wanted to tear my teeth out.A perfect 3D fest right from the inception of the movie till the end, the movie has taken CGI to the next level with Scorsese's classic method of action capturing and boy I must say I was amazed as I kept on pointing how beautiful the effects appeared with every scene. Everything seemed so real, right from their countenances to the environment – the beautiful sea, the vast Parisian suburbs and every tiny detail. The story took us to one hell of a ride with Hugo solving the mystery and connecting the dots for us. Monsieur Labisse had never been portrayed that brilliantly, keeping in mind every tiny details and facial expressions. Isabelle appeared ditto as it used to be in the cartoons and equally cute too.Hugo, superbly portrayed by Asa Butterfield, concerns a 12-year-old orphan who lives in the walls of a Paris train station in an alternate 1930 and a parallel universe where they spoke British English in France (?) Hugo however smells the foul play and since then takes us on a joy ride connecting the pieces together with the assistance of Monsieur Labisse (Christopher Lee – A perfect choice for the role .. He has gone so much better .. Christopher Lee for president !) who has been kidnapped by Monsieur Labisse.The movie gives you a unique experience of 3D and motion capturing which I think is a must watch. Martin knows how to impeccably exploit technology. Go watch this one if you want to witness awesomeness in 3D and get what you paid for.

I was seduced by the reviews on IMDb into watching this movie. It's got some big names, it's got terrific production values (think Dickens crossed with steampunk), an interesting concept, but ultimately badly let down by the execution, which generates no real emotion, not even sentimental nostalgia. Part of it is disbelief: the two main child actors talk and act like adults, are dressed and shot like adults, their reactions and motivations are those of adults. Then there's the complete lack of chemistry between any two members of the cast.You're rewarded for your patience (it's a two and a half hour film) with some great visuals, humorous scenes especially from the supporting cast, a bit of early film history (the famous train scene is shown, as well as a bit of Méliès' work) though too disjointed to really enjoy, and a generally pleasant film, but precious little else.

The art of adaptation is tricky. Often filmmakers manage to find nuances from the book and expand upon those nuances to make a movie that is as deep and affecting as the book, unfortunately Hugo is not one such movie.This adaptation of Brian Selznick's enchanting novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret lacks the taut structure and emotional heft of its source material, resulting in a cinematic experience far from enchanting. Director Martin Scorsese did put together a nice ensemble of craftsmen to create some breathtaking sets, costumes, and cinematography, but the thrill of the expertly crafted crafts only lasts for maybe ten minutes, then one would think the story should draw the viewer in, but it never does.Hugo is an orphan living in the walls of a 1930's Parisian train station, winding the clocks whilst rebuilding an automaton that his father found before he died. Here is the thing, the actors do the best with what they were given, but the script lacks any real life and feels like a workman's paycheck. Time is never given in the editing or the pacing of scenes to let the audience reflect on the emotions of the moment, so we never see the actor's reacting or showing any emotion to the events transpiring.For example, after Hugo's notebook is taken by the owner of a toy shop booth that he has been stealing from to get parts for the automaton, he should be devastated, right? But instead we see Hugo, immediately after, winding the clocks and watching people in the train station, laughing at their humorous situations. Not to mention, these attempts at comedy always fall flat, in particular with Sacha Baron Cohen's Station Inspector, whose antics just take too long to develop and fills up far too much screen time. The script by John Logan is just poorly paced, with scenes going from high tension and a hankering for a huge pay-off, to the brakes being hit to deliver a laugh.While Scorsese obviously shows his penchant for film history near the end with a nicely put together ten minute mini-doc in the movie that details the life of pioneer filmmaker Georges Meilies, ten minutes of enchantment do not make up for a haphazard hour and fifty minutes before all of that. As much of a fan I was of Selznick's novel, Hugo is an adaptation that perhaps should have never happened.I give Hugo a 4 out of 10!

From the very first minute, this film is breathtakingly beautiful and amazing. The art, cinematography, lighting, acting, story, direction, are all amazing. This film should be given multiple Academy Awards, especially for Best Director (Scorsese), Best Actor (Asa Butterfield), Best Actress (Chloe Moretz), Best Supporting Actors (Ben Kingsley & Sacha Baron Cohen) and Cinematography. The casting was superb, all actors were very believable, I loved everyone of them, kudos to Martin Scorsese for bringing out the best in the cast.The only criticism I can put forth, is that it is a little slow for children, my 11 year old son got a little fidgety at times, but still loved the movie in the end."Hugo" is a masterpiece, a true work of art in film.

this is not a fairy tale or magical movie at all. it's plain visual effect, trying to make money out of minimal spending. i would think the story was really about finding a secret or an adventure. it turned out to be a hidden story about some old man, that used to be a film maker, an artist, so they said. my 9-yr old & i were waiting for surprises scene after scene, but none of them came. the only surprise was only a dream! to me, this movie is really for elderly people. no offense. they could've made it a more interesting story for younger audience. it's all about exaggeration of Martin's plays sold to family in Thanksgiving. i totally disagree this movie is rated that high. Happy Feet 2 is way better & appropriate for kids.

Preliminary reviews suggested that this was a masterpiece but upon seeing the movie I found it fell short of that lofty appraisal. The story is very good but the movie runs too long and has stretches of boredom, especially when trying to develop subsidiary characters. The movie picks up every time Ben Kingsley appears but Asa Buttererfield disappoints in the lead role as I found that I was watching him act rather than being caught up in his character. Chloe Grace Moretz and Emily Mortimer are very good in their roles but Sacha Baron Cohen is over the top in a uneven performance. I am not a fan of 3D and this movie could have done without it, although I must admit there are some incredibly wondrous 3D effects but there are also a number of scenes where the 3D is a distraction. I would suggest that this is not a "kids" movie but one for those at least 10 and over. This is not a classic movie but still rates (in my opinion) a 7 out 10.

Three years ago, I picked up a book that I knew almost NOTHING about, save a couple of paragraphs of a review that I had read. That book was "The Invention of Hugo Cabret", the debut novel of established illustrator Brian Selznick. Faithful to his previous illustration work, Selznick chose to tell his story in a rather unusual fashion- using pictures and words. But "The Invention of Hugo Cabret" is far from a GRAPHIC NOVEL. It is a novel with some breathtaking sketches. When I read that Martin Scorsessee was attached to adapt the book into a movie, in 3D no less, I was actually VERY excited. I felt that 3D was the BEST way to tackle such a visual novel, and it turns out that I was right, in some ways. Scorsessee's adaptation of the novel, which went through several title changes before settling with "Hugo", received much praise for it's storytelling, and especially for its use of the "overrated" medium of 3D, particularly from "Avatar" and "Titanic" director James Cameron, who called the film the "Best use of 3D ever." Mr. Cameron knows his 3D, I trusted his word, and rightly so. As soon as the opening credits started, I became fully aware that I was in for a REAL TREAT."Hugo" is the story of a young orphan, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who lives in the Paris train station during the 1930s. He has been alone since his father (Played in flashbacks by Jude Law) was killed in a tragic fire, and his uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a frequently drunk man who worked as the timekeeper at the station disappeared. Hugo must move throughout the train station carefully, so to avoid the watchful eyes of Gustave (Sacha Baron-Cohen), the often comical station inspector. It's his sneakiness that gets him in trouble with an aging man known as Papa Georges (Sir Ben Kingsley), who runs a small toy stand at the station. Along with Georges' god-daughter, Isabel, Hugo embarks on a journey that is equal parts remarkable and magical, and one that is filled with long- lost secrets from the past. "Hugo" is FAR from a carbon copy of Selznick's REMARKABLE novel, but it IS remarkable in it's own right. Scorsessee and his team PERFECTLY capture the look and feel of the novel's settings, and ESPECIALLY the characters. In the end, this is certainly Scorsessee's love letter to classic cinema, and to the French Filmmakers who he truly admires and looks up to. By the time the film ended, I was left truly moved, and with the impression that I had just had one of the most MAGICAL movie going experiences of my life.

This is visually one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. It is definitely worth it to pay the few extra dollars to see it in 3D.The use of the 3D technology in this film is nothing like I have ever seen. There isn't a single scene that has that feeling that it was added for the sake of something "jumping out at you", just a rich, warm visual feast of an environment that serves to enhance an already very good, very watchable movie. Hugo is as much for adults as it is for children. It has a well thought out story line with charming characters. The acting is never overdone and although it may be a bit slow for younger children, it is enjoyable from start to finish. We took my mother, teenagers, and two nine year olds and they all loved it.

I went into this movie for pure entertainment, I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it was...The acting was excellent, especially from Sir Ben Kingsley (which is the reason I saw this movie). The kid actors were surprisingly good too. Sacha Baron Cohen was hilarious as the Inspector. Back to Kingsley, he was the highlight of the movie even though he wasn't the main star. I just can't get how he made his emotions so real and believable. Another minor actor that did well was Jude Law. Even though he had less than twenty minutes of screen time, he made that time count. Chloë was amazing along with the kid star Asa, even though he didn't steal the show, he was the second best actor behind Kingsley. Christopher Lee also has a small part and he made his screen time count just like Jude Law. I applaud the great acting.The plot of the film was very interesting. The movie was almost like a mystery, some would argue it was a mystery. There was also humor (most of it came from Sacha). There were times during the movie where I was literally was at the end of my seat. Sometimes I was thinking to myself, "you're being loud, they might hear you!" or "look out!" The movie definitely engaged me.The direction and 3D of the film was magnificent! Martin Scorsese knew what to do with the script and he did it well. The angles of the camera and the shots he did were very extraordinary. The 3D was used the right way. Forget about the useless 3D films, Thor, Captain America, etc. The 3D isn't used to make things pop out, it's used to add more depth to the film. It's also used for art for some certain scenes. People who thoroughly enjoyed the 3D for Avatar, will love the 3D for this film. I don't know why they marketed this movie for kids, some kids may enjoy, but it's mostly for adults, because there are some adult elements that little ones may not understand.I had an amazing experience with this film, you won't regret it. I really hope this movie breaks budget, that's the least this movie deserves. See this movie, for your own good.

There are only seven or eight American directors now working who can be called true artists, visionary auteur's with a signature. They are Paul Thomas Anderson, Terrence Malick,Clint Eastwood, The Coen Brothers( who I treat at a single directorial intelligence), David Lynch, Steven Spielberg(despite his flaws), maybe Spike Jonze, and above all, Martin Scorsese. Martin has done four classic gangster movies, a (flawed) musical, documentaries, a brilliant, under-rated costume drama, two startling religious epics, two brilliant biopics about gifted, tormented men, a Hitchcockian thriller, and two superb black comedies, one of which ( After Hours) almost out-Lynches Lynch.). Admittedly, He has not yet done a War Movie or a Western. ( Though I would not count out either as possibilities.) Another genre he has not touched is the children's film. He has made two PG rated films, The Age Of Innocence and Kundun, but neither could be called a kids film. Now, Scorsese has made a children's film. Even more incredibly, he has made a 3-d children's film that is also a period film, and he has hit the ball out of the park. As a cinematic achievement- indeed,as a sheer feat of human imagination, Hugo can only be called superb. This film is an beautifully designed, shot and edited tribute to the innocence and imagination of childhood, AND a heart-felt love letter to the movies. Touching, funny and extraordinarily inspiring and redemptive, this is a masterpiece from a director who can only be called a god of the cinema. I will never forget Hugo.

Martin Scorsese directing a kid's movie? You cannot be serious.That was the thought that ran through my head when I first read about Hugo, based on the children's book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. While it seemed like an intriguing idea, I was a bit skeptical that a man who has spent almost fifty years in the business directing violent gangster pictures and sweepingly violent period pieces would really be well equipped to direct something that was directed at youngsters. Add the fact that it is in 3D, and you have the first real time I had a doubt in Scorsese. Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives as an orphan rotating and setting the clocks properly at a train station near Paris post 1930s economic depression. He is caught by the local toy store shopkeeper (played by Ben Kingsley), who confiscates the sketch pad filled with inventions and ideas originally owned by Hugo's father. Hugo obviously wants to retrieve it, but there is something deeply troubling the shopkeeper. And with the help of his granddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), the pair set out to find out just what is troubling him.For all the critical praise it has and will continue to receive, it does not negate the fact that Hugo is two-thirds of a horrifically boring movie. It starts off interesting enough, but then it slows right down and barely picks itself back up. Until the subplots kicked in about the pioneering of the filmmaking medium, I had absolutely no idea where the film was going – and neither did the film. It just plays itself out without much concern, introducing characters, ideas and elements which may have proved valuable at the time, but are next to useless in the final end game. I found myself frequently questioning just what Scorsese was trying to accomplish, and found that the film was more often than not, at odds with itself. It is not a children's film by a long shot, but it is not necessarily an adult film either. There are moments of adventure and whimsy, but then there are some really dark and disturbing moments as well. It just does not know what it wants to be, and suffers as a result of it. When I am fighting the urge to pass out during one of the most highly anticipated films of the year because I am bored to tears, then there is clearly an issue.While we can blame the lack of any semblance of plot development on the source material (I have not read Selznick's novel, but it sounds like a mish-mash of ideas that barely come together), I feel that Scorsese is a talented enough director that he should have been able to see through the problems, and fix them with relative ease. He is out of his element here making his first real "children's movie", but his craft is just as impeccable as always. Surely he could tell that he needed to make his thinly veiled plea for cinematic restoration and preservation a lot sooner and clearer than he does, right? He clearly has a passion for the material, but the film lacks that electric feel that most Scorsese films have. It lacks that jolt, that spark that really transcends the medium, and sets his work apart from everyone else's. If you had very little knowledge of the project and left Hugo before the cinema subplot kicks in, you may not even know the film was part of Scorsese's oeuvre. It may simply look like a very gorgeous film, with some intriguing characters and a total lack of a cohesive story. But for all the story related issues, I must say that the film is very impressive to look at. The sets, the costumes, and the editing style – all of it is just as incredible as we have come to expect. Scorsese knows how to make a really authentic and meticulously designed period piece, and his work here is no different. But what really makes it dazzle and come to life, rather surprisingly, is the 3D. It is generously employed throughout the film very carefully, very rarely coming off as the gimmick it inherently is. Instead, it adds depth and a stunning realism to the film. It feels like you are in the movie, experiencing what Hugo sees and feels. It may look extremely fake when it hits Blu-ray, but there is no questioning how astonishing it looks here. Seeing the clocks in action is particularly wonderful, as is the subtle use of snow outside and dust inside. And even though it is used quite frequently, you never grow tired of it. You just sit in your seat, and wait for the next effect Scorsese throws at you.Acting is strong across the board, from main players like Butterfield, Moretz, Sacha Baron Cohen and Kingsley, to bit players who serve very little purpose like Frances de la Tour, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee and Emily Mortimer, to blink-and-you-will-miss-them extended cameos like Jude Law and Ray Winstone. Everyone is on their A-game, and shines well above the dialogue and actions they are given. Particular attention needs to be played to Butterfield, who shoulders the majority of the film almost exclusively. His plight is the stuff of wonder and imagination, and would have been simply riveting had the film's content been a bit better focused. While Hugo is a positively stunning experience to view, the majority of the story leaves a lot to be imagined. Even with the great acting and wonderful 3D, the film suffers from a horrendous element of boredom constantly. When the third act kicks in, it finally figures out what it wants to be and suddenly the film becomes the masterpiece it should have been all along. I did enjoy Hugo, but this is quite simply a good movie that could have been brilliant. 8/10.

Scorsese is without a doubt one of the greatest living, if not the best, American film directors. His filmography is beyond compare in terms of its consistency of quality and diversity of genres covered. With Hugo, he has made one of his most personal films, as it deals with a young boy who discovers and falls in love with cinema. What sets Hugo apart from other family films from the likes of Pixar and Disney is that it does not resort to cloying pop culture references, and it respects the intelligence of both children and adults. Most significantly, Hugo is in the end a love letter to film, to the wonder and awe that the first films and filmmakers felt as they created moving images. Scorsese is saying that this love for the film medium has been steadily depleted with the advancement of technology, but ironically, Scorsese is using the latest cinematic technology (3D), and using it to comment upon film history.SPOILER ALERT!The homage scene of silent films at the end of Hugo left the audience in tears, and Hugo is, without a doubt, one of Scorsese's top five films.

So entirely disappointed by the most boring movie ever. I kept twisting and turning and ho-humming in my seat waiting and begging for something to happen. Nothing ever did. Sure there were a few scenes where the 3D looked great. I wasn't looking for a special effects movie, I was looking for the story...... and the story I hated. The story was so geared towards movie buffs, old movies; there is hardly a child that will understanding nor care about the plot. I almost fell asleep. I had such high hopes for this one. I didn't cry, I didn't chuckle.... just watched, and watched, and watched. It felt like it would never end. After awhile all I could think of is the $20 I spent plus the $20 for popcorn and soda and what I could have done with my $40.

Professor Hugo Martin Scorsese's lastest masterpiece. Who directed the film shows us the different styles so well, just like he comes from a professor.All must respect the teacher to stand up for love cinema. Luckily, criticisms and praise of this film was extremely inspiring film that the undisputed master of the latest movies after nearly five decades of success reminds again.Although Scorsese is known with gangster films, but his films in various genres such as sports or movie trailers and apprehension that I was able to create masterpieces like Raging Bull and Shutter Island. And now you see Scorsese's latest masterpiece at the Family Theater.

I watched this movie believing the ratings & genre of the movie for real. Cinema hall had only 15 people inside on day 1 ,so I had to check twice if i was in the right cinema hall .Movie making is great but its definitely not a commercial movie or adventures or drama movie .Its a great movie for people who love history . Movie goes on very slowly and but do not expect any surprises or get entertainment out of this movie especially if you are not into history loving .....Over all its a plain simple history story but kids would love it for sure I would recommend parents to take their kids to this movie to show them or educate them how movies were made with what they got in the initial days without having fancy cameras & technology .

From the trailers I was very excited to see the movie with my 9 year old cousin (so was she). I could tell from the trailer she wouldn't be bored to tears and she would be able to understand the movie (with not wanting to see Christmas movies, and the other too inappropriate). Unfortunately the the entire time throughout the movie I wanted to close my eyes and take a nap. The story line in the beginning left me with numerous questions as to why an orphan boy was living in a clock tower, looked healthy as can be, didn't have very long hair, and had a smile of his face. "Eh, it's a children's movie" I'm thinking to myself. So I go along and it takes a while (about what seems to be 40 minutes) for these questions to be answered. As to why he looks so healthy and lively is probably because it's not exactly appropriate to show a sickly boy in a 'children's' movie. As the movie progresses the story line seems to be pulled along by a train with no wheels. Hugo 'be-friends' a girl named, Isabelle. Isabelle is a bookworm as it seems and a the god-child of Georges (whom Hugo works for). Throughout I bare my eye open in knowing I'm going to have to have a reason as to why I disliked the movie so far. We learn Hugo has a 'metal manikin' and through the excitement of Hugo and Isabelle I assumed the 'manikin' would provide comfort to Hugo seeing as he only has Isabelle as a friend so far. I assumed it would get up and talk the way Hugo was so excited about it. No, it did not. Moving past the way the movie moves so slowly I would like to address that this movie is NOT recommended by me to have a child who does not understand what Silent Movies are, why they have such a meaning to us, and what is reality and what is not. Though the first part is about Hugo and fixing this 'manikin' the second is about finding out why Georges is so upset about finding Hugo's notebook. Also, why (when Hugo fixes it that is) why 'manikin' drew a picture with Georges signature on it. The two friends find out that Georges created silent movies that opened the 'world's' eyes it seems to what could be made from movies. Entering dreams. They show some silent films made by Georges and they are great to see (as I, though only 15, have enjoyed). Younger kids may not understand this part of the movie so explanation maybe needed. In one scene it seems that a train is going to hit Hugo while he on the tracks. The train is pulling into the station at a very fast speed (again, why? What trains pulls in at what seems to be 45mph?). The train hits Hugo and barrels through the station and eventually through the (what I think), the clock. Hugo wakes up in a panic. As this scene is going on a child behind me continually asks his mother an father what is going on. My cousin gives me a confused look and I'll know that later I'll have to explain. Turning back to the screen I see Hugo unbuttons his shirt to reveal he is made of clock work. Again, it is only a dream and again the child behind me asks because he doesn't understand. In another scene Hugo actually jumps down on the tracks to get the 'manikin' that has fallen down there. At first I'm unsure as to why but eventually I realize that this is reality but I'm unsure whether Hugo knows that. The train is barreling down the tracks and nearly hits Hugo but the station 'officer' pulls Hugo to safety. In my opinion that isn't appropriate to a child who doesn't understand what is reality and what is not.My final is that Hugo and Isabelle are children around the age of 11-13. From what Hugo does I would much rather have him be a 14 or 15 year old boy. He's outside a clock and one wrong move could send him down to his death. His knowledge and maturity does not fit him, nor Isabelle's no matter how bright she is. I assure you, I was not this smart when I was their age. Overall, this movie bored me, I didn't find the trailer fitting to the age group, and deserved a 3 or 4.

I'll be honest with you, Hugo is not a "movie". It is a piece of art that holds a meaning, and heart. It will inspire you to be the best you can be, and it will remind you that you are important, and were placed on the planet for a purpose. The cinematography is beyond brilliant, and when seen in 3D, it spirals into an awesome 4D feel. I myself couldn't help but grin when I was showered in glass, bombarded with rubble, and covered in splintered wood as the train crashed off the track and plowed through the train station.Asa Butterfield couldn't be better as Hugo. His eyes are so expressive, and he gives a great performance that draws you into his story, and gives you sympathy for him. To me, he's like the new Harry Potter, if you know what I mean. Not just Asa, but all of the cast gives there best performance to bring this film to life.Another thing I like about this film, is that, while it is so entertaining, it is also very informative about the history of film, giving the story a feel of purpose.I gave it a 9 out of 10, because not every film is perfect, and doesn't offer something for EVERYONE. I would have like the movie to shed more light on Hugo's father, but over all, "HUGO" is AWESOME. Get to your nearest movie theater, and see this movie in 3D! That's right, I said 3D. You won't regret it!

"As if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen . . . T.S. EliotGeorges Melies for many movie buffs represents the love affair with imaginative filmmaking at its earliest. Inspired by the Lumiere brothers' short film, Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat (1897), Melies went on in the early years of the 20th century to create such flights of fancy as A Trip to the Moon (1902) with a rocket ship hitting the eye of the Man in the Moon. Martin Scorsese loves movies and their celluloid preservation, so Hugo is no surprise as a fantasy of an early '30's orphan living in the walls of a French train station restoring an automaton invented by Melies (Sir Ben Kingsley), who now owns a toy store in the station. Young Hugo (Asa Butterfiled) and his friend Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) adventure into the world of artifice and romance called movies.In the discovery of Melies' extant footage, Scorsese makes a strong case for preservation of the old combustible celluloid, a lifelong crusade of his. Yet the heart of the film is the boy's emerging love of cinema, like Scorsese's, reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso and Super 8. I think of Woody Allen's reverie about the '20's, Midnight in Paris, for the nostalgic recreation of a romantic era in the arts. For both auteurs, movies are an artistic expression and a way to meet the past.Although Scorsese uses ample CGI and 3-D, the opening alone is a marvel of swooping in on the train, its station, digital crowds, and ultimately the hidden boy, like our secret selves descending on a movie set. It reminds me of Mike Nichols' opening sequence to Working Girl, where his camera flies down like a god on and into the Staten Island ferry. In this case Scorsese uses 3-D in a way I have rarely seen—the right way. It's all magical.Melies began as a magician, and Hugo's father made a living in his shop for mechanical wonderments, both no doubt a paean to special effects. It's how modern Martin continues the fantasy by smoothly creating another world, as he did in The Age of Innocence, this time a world he knows intimately: the paradise of cinema.

I was actually angry leaving the theatre after this movie. Although it is well acted and nice to look at, I was very let down by this movie. The previews make it seem like a different movie than it is. The story line is non-existent. I kept waiting for something to happen and IT NEVER DID. I thought the robot was going to come alive and that is what the movie is centered around; DOES NOT HAPPEN. The exciting parts of the movie are in the previews. Instead, you have a sleeper of a story about Kingsley. Shacha Baron Cohen's performance will be raved about by critics, when actually it's very predictable. Kids around me were talking the whole time because they did not understand the movie and it was so boring. The whole movie is not worth the money.Overall, If you are looking for a "fantasy"/"adventure" this movie is definitely not it. -and don't bring your kids.

The film "Hugo", Martin Scosese newest film currently has cinematic reviews that were similar to his other works "Gangs of New York" or "Shutter Island." Each movie succumbed to the marketing hype of Martin Scorsese's genius, meanwhile forgetting the fact, each of these films is never chosen for a re- watch. I am a Martin Scorsese fan. This film leaves the viewer watching ninety minutes of stage preparation and bland information before the story starts; and still, a poorly comprised story at that.Hugo is prime example of a badly written screenplay with a huge budget. As other reviewers have said, it is a visually gorgeous film. That however doesn't make up for the languishing story that starts as fast as a 1930's steam engine. The entire story places misguided buildup on character points and plot lines that change over the course of the two hour film. As wonderful as it is to be given the accurate view of the everyday activities of the Paris train station workers (despite they all speak English), they were sidebars to the story. Seeing the mundane jobs of characters who do not have a place in the story takes away from the precious time Martin Scorsese had for character and story development needed to make this a good movie. My expectation is this film will always have moderate to good reviews. However, on a movie night at home, like "Gang's of New York" or "Shutter Island", viewers will choose to NOT watch a movie at all than waste another two hours of their life watching a bad movie.

Martin Scorsese's most recent film is touching, exciting, and remarkably beautiful. Although the famed director is known for such gangster movies as Goodfellas and The Departed, he may have achieved his greatest moment with this family film.Based on Brian Selznick's book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, the film follows the life of the title character: an orphan living in the walls of a Paris train station. Hugo's father was a clock maker, and one day found an old, rusted mechanical man in the attic of a museum. The father and son decide to repair this automaton together, trying to discover what message it will write when cranked. But before they can finish, Hugo's father dies, and the boy must live with his drunken Uncle at the train station—at least until he disappears, too. Now Hugo spends his time stealing parts from a toy maker to fix the automaton, and constantly avoiding the station inspector.The film, however, is about much more than just this young boy. The subject of the birth of film is a major theme, focusing on the marvelous and dream-like work of George Melies, who practically invented the way modern movies are made. Scorsese is right at home in discussing and paying tribute to these classic and bizarre films.The dream quality of Melies' work spills over into Hugo. The film is so involving and engrossing that this reviewer became completely entranced, forgetting the outside world in favor of Scorsese's take on a majestic 1930's Paris. Scorsese does a particularly good job of making every shot absolutely breathtaking. The snowy Paris nights and the reproductions of old films are nothing short of enchanting.Asa Butterfield plays Hugo, giving sincerity in his performance, something that is rarely seen in actors. Chloe Grace Moretz is great as the girl that enters Hugo's life, filled with worldly knowledge beyond her years. Ben Kingsley is fantastic as the bitter old toy maker, and Sacha Baron Cohen gives a surprising amount of big laughs as the station inspector.While the 3D is nice, it certainly isn't necessary. In fact, the 3D was so good because for the most part it remained unobtrusive. There are some very nice moments inside the walls of the train station and with the clockwork, but nothing really worth the extra cash.Hugo is a masterpiece, and one of Scorsese's all time best. Filled with allegory and fable, the film is enjoyable on a multitude of levels, and is a fun, glorious adventure for people of all ages.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/

Martin Scorsese would like to preemptively thank the Academy for what will likely be at least four nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Ben Kingsley), and Best Supporting Actress (Helen McCrory). Given most of the movie serves as a celebration of movie-making as an art and movie directors as artists, they don't have much choice. Also it gives the Academy a chance to dole out a lifetime achievement award to Scorsese and Kingsley (although he has done a fair bit of schlock such as "Species"). Wrapped around the brief history of the earliest beginnings of movie-making and the self-reverential celebration of film-making is the plot from the book "The Invention of Hugo Cabret". In this story, an orphan subsists in the Paris train station by stealing and spends most of his time running from the station's dedicated constable. Somehow we are lead to believe this is preferable to be sent to the local orphanage. In an interesting casting move lunatic Sasha Baron Cohen plays the socially awkward policeman. Unlike most prior roles we don't see him naked but we are invited to laugh at a physical deformity resulting from an injury sustained in World War II so he does retain some of his trademark offense. While the casting decision mixed things up in what is a very staid and stately film, Cohen's maniacal vibe is largely wasted here and the part could have been played by any number of actors. Certainly a gorgeous film and a good use of 3-D; however, even here the 3-D medium feels gimmicky. Scorsese swings for the fences with the technology and it is its breadth and Merchant Ivory grand, sweeping feel that leads to some of the problems with the movie. The chief among these lies with the slow, stately pacing which is simply dull in a number of particularly slow spots. The intrusive soundtrack often offers some bouncing bit of orchestral shenanigans during these times when not much is happening on the screen further highlighting the yawn-worthy scenes. A second major problem comes from a jarring break between the main Hugo plot and the academic salute to movie-making which starts about three-fifths into the film. By the time the history lesson ends, the return to the Hugo's battle against Cohen almost could use a recap for those who had forgotten the earlier story. In short, not a great film but with too many of the elements needed to a Best Picture nom and probably win unless the Weinsteins come up with another historical period drama.

Hugo is an enchanting film that will dazzle the viewer with its beautiful scenes, real characters, and simple emotional story. This wonderful film reminds me of one of my favorite Italian films "Cinema Paradiso", as they both stir up strong emotions in a simple and beautiful way.Hugo is an orphan who lives at a train station and cares for the station's clocks. Hugo is devoted to fixing a mechanical robot (an automaton), hoping for a message from his deceased father. Hugo steals from a toy shop owner, constantly dodges the train station policeman, and befriends a young girl. These characters become an important part of Hugo's life, as he works to uncover the mystery of the automaton.I haven't been a big fan of 3-D technology, which has been disappointing in most films that I've seen in 3D. However, Hugo's 3-D effects are stunning and really make you feel part of the scenes. The director Martin Scorcese does a magical job with this 3-D medium in creating a visual masterpiece.While billed as a children's movie, this film will be more appreciated by adults and older children. The story moves slowly, but, since the movie pulls you into Paris of many years ago, you don't even notice. Overall, Hugo is a wonderful and unique film that we'll be a rewarding movie experience.

This movie was nothing short of wonderful. I read the book last year on recommendation. I loved every word and picture and this film was no different.To be honest, I wasn't expecting this to be a good movie. After so many letdowns from previous book-inspired movie adaptations, I guess I've come to expect disappointment. Boy was I wrong!The charcoal sketches from the book were illustrated perfectly in the setting of the movie. The actors were well cast and I found myself enjoying each role. It's hard not to feel for each one of their stories. (Don't worry, I won't spoil anything by describing that bit further!)Overall, a fun family-friendly movie. c:

Hugo is a beautifully made movie with great 3D effects. Yet with the misleading advertising, the story that goes nowhere, and with over 2 hour runtime it is one hell of a boring movie.Please do not believe 8.3 IMDb and 94% RT ratings, this movie one of the most overrated movies in the history of the film, the word 'history' is the key one here. When everything is said and done Hugo reveals itself as nothing but a cleverly disguised homage to one of the French pioneering movie directors, a subject interesting primarily for the movie history buffs.As I said Hugo is hugely misrepresented in advertising. Every poster tells you that some Narnia type adventure is awaiting you. All the trailers were masterfully crafted to leave you with expectation of magical miracle. The words like 'quest' and 'mystery' are a part of Hugo's brief description on each and every site, just read what it says on IMDb. Furthermore the word "adventure" is lavishly sprinkled throughout the Hugo's first part. And yes, great Martin Scorsese is behind all of it, so what should you expect but a magical adventure on a grandeur scale ? Sorry, you will get none of that. Yes, Hugo is like a charming 3D French postcard, but its not worth looking at for over 2 hours. 3D effects are well done, yet absolutely not required for this story that never leaves the setting of Paris train station.While plot has some holes, the elephant in the room is that pretty much nothing happens in the movie with all these mechanical dolls, golden keys, and the visually rich Dickensian atmosphere. And be sure, there is absolutely no magic, or any type of adventure hidden here.I am giving Hugo just one star to counter misleading ads and all those hypists that ether work for the studio, or easily hypnotized by big director's name. Please have few good games on your smartphone and bring a thermos with coffee if you decide to go see this snoozefest, you will need it.

I went in with high expectations. Heck, the movie was sitting at 8.6 on here(still is?).74/100 Hugo is a visual masterpiece. It did have some of the best use of 3D technology to date, but I still wish I had gone to see the 2D version. 3D is kind of cool, but I think it takes away from the clarity of the picture. This may be the last time I spend my money on a 3D picture, and it has nothing to do with Scorcese's first attempt with this technology - he did a great job.This movie is not a comedy. It's quite important to know that going in. It is a drama about an orphan/genius/clockmaker.The film is, for the most part, light-hearted and feel-good throughout, but the film really doesn't have a great story to tell. Scorcese goes in many different directions here, and tries to mold them together in what becomes an anti-climactic finish.I think the film would have benefited from more dialog for its' lead character.Small spoilers coming. The whole movie-theme here was interesting, but like the rest of the film it thrives only visually and doesn't seem to have much substance. Hearing Ben Kingsley talk about why his films waned in popularity seemed like a bunch of jabberwocky. The whole theme resonated like another nod to Hollywood that really boosts ratings for some reason, but never really tugs the heart-strings. It's a given that any film "about film or making film" is going to be over-rated in these circles. Why? I have no idea.(Hollywood likes itself - see Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Get SHorty, The Player, Adaptation, Ed Wood, etc - make a Hollywood movie and the critics will Loooooove you) Granted, some of those films are very good, but they still tend to be over-rated.That also means this is going to be getting some Oscar nominations. It could be in the race for cinematography and some other 'visual' categories, but this is no best picture by any means.We needed this film to have as much focus on the dialog and story as it did the visuals and the film-theme. It was obvious to me that the director was bowing to film-makers and Ben Kingsley, and not really worrying too much about the rest of us.The film needed some more comedy and action. And even though it's a drama - it needed more drama too.The film is beautiful to look at, and in that aspect it might very well be the best movie of the year. The problem here is that there are virtually no stand out scenes. I've read some reviews that talked about other peoples' reactions to the film. While I didn't interview anybody else in the theater - everyone in the theater did not react to the film for the duration, and they were half way out of their seats 5 seconds before the credits rolled.A great example of visual genius with a huge dose of existentialism from the director. In the end, it's just another over-rated film about making film that the average person can't relate to, and the other story-lines fall kind of flat.The whole time I was thinking, "what he's doing with camera is amazing, but what he's doing with the story is dull".I know this review was harsh. This is a good movie, but it deserves more like 7.5. If you want a better example of this type of story/style - then revisit "The Black Stallion". It has more interesting characters, more action, and more that the common person can relate to than this film does - and it's no less of a visual masterpiece. I find it weird that "The Black Stallion" can employ a kid that never acted in his life before the production, and yet that performance has more substance than the lead characters in the last two blockbusters I watched(Hugo and Super 8).Why "The Black Stallion" is rated 7.1 and this is rated 8.6 is beyond me. I know which one I'd rather re-watch.Worth a look, but do not expect action or comedy.You might like this if you liked:The Black Stallion(better), The Polar Express(not as good), Cinema Paradiso(much better) Great Expectations(hawke version, better), or City of Ember(worse).Right now it's sitting at 7 on my top 10 of 2011 list, but it might have trouble holding on with Meloncholia, 50/50, Midnight in Paris, and Drive still in the watch-list.

Hugo is based upon the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. The film is a period piece film, taking place in 1930's Paris, France. Fans of director Martin Scorsese may also want to note that this is his first time directing a family film and also one in 3D. The film is full of enchantment and lots to behold and wonder at, so I feel that if I was to give too much away it would spoil the film, so I suggest you look elsewhere for a plot synopsis, or even watch the film's trailer. I found a lot to like about Hugo, but there were also a few things that I had problems with as well. First the good. The film looks great. Normally, I am not a fan of films in 3D because I find that they look fake and it just feels ever so much more like you are watching a computer program, or video game and does not feel real in any way. The visual effects in Hugo are all extremely well done and they look believable and give the film a great look. Every so often a character's face may look a bit askew when trying to capture it with the 3D background, but that does not happen too often and for the most part it looks great. The whole film looks great from it's visual effects, costumes, set decorations, make up and cinematography. It's a wonderfully authentic and dazzling piece of eye candy that also looks and feels of 1930's Paris, France and has all the charm and beauty of the city as well. The acting here is all very good from everybody. The whole cast is very talented and they all do a great job in their individual roles. The adults are good and the kids do a great job here as well. The story to the film is very original and for me I was quite intrigued as to how and where the film would go and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a little bit of everything from fantasy, mystery, comedy, science fiction and is even an open love letter to a certain art form that if you see the film you will know what I mean and I think that reason alone is why film lover Martin Scorsese made the film in the first place. The film enchants with it's visuals, keeps us interested with it's adventuresome and likable characters and the different magical and mysterious things going on. The film is marketed as a family film, but I can definitely see adults appreciating the film more than children, but older children may find something here to like as well. Now on to the few things I had a problem with during the film. I thoroughly enjoyed myself during the duration of the film, but there were times when the film did feel a bit long. It's not an overly long movie at two hours and seven minutes, but there are certain scenes that do drag on a bit and after the film is over it somehow feels like the film was much longer than the running time I just provided you with, even though it is not. Also, I did like all of the characters in the film, but I felt that there were too many subplots going on during the film that took away from the main story. It's not that they were not interesting, but they didn't have all that much to do with the central theme, or message of the story and ultimately just made the film longer and this is in parts where it began to drag, so I would have to say some of the additional stories were a little unnecessary. Had they been trimmed down, or edited a bit, or maybe found a different way to incorporate them into the film it could have worked, but as it is they don't. Those are probably my only problems with the film and while I still liked it a fair bit and admired a lot about it, I can not honestly say that it is a great film, or one of the year's best. Still there is a lot here that I think movie lovers will admire and get a lot out of, so I still recommend Hugo and it is a nice feel good film, especially appropriate now in time for the holidays, so I would still recommend it, but for me it had enough flaws to prevent it from being a masterpiece, but it is still definitely worth seeing even if you have to pay a little extra for the accompanying 3D glasses.

Lovely movie, with the story every bit as magical as the special effects. The acting, the screenplay, the music, the editing, all flawless. And the paradox at the core - a movie about time and temporality is also about the timeless quality of all that's important...family, relationships, the things we all long for, and then rather than leave all of the metaphors and symbols up for grabs, he dares to offer an answer, a moral answer: We're all broken. So we have three choices in life. Be someone who breaks things, be someone who fixes things, or be someone who just stands there, bemused and bewildered, doing nothing. For many years Scorsese has been doing his best to fix the problem of decaying films. With "Hugo" he shows how love can fix almost everything, and that yes, the world is filled with things that are broken, but that we're put here to work. See a problem? Get busy.

We went in expecting another great film from a great director but came away totally disappointed. For almost 2 hours, we set there wearing those high-priced 3D glasses waiting for the movie to kick in. Instead, we got a poorly-written Saturday morning/Hallmark film that kept repeating it's message (save old films!). I won't even bother with spoilers since there is nothing to spoil.The only highlight was the excellent acting by a stellar cast. To bad it was all wasted on this melodramatic muck. And so corny, too. Oh well, at least the turkey before the film was better than the turkey on the screen.

Director Martin Scorsese really hit it out of the park with this one. He has taken 3D movie-making to the next level. This film felt like a fairytale for both adults and children and has forever changed the viewing experience from average to spectacular. Although the film started out a little slow, I think that this is one of Marty's better works and is definitely Oscar-worthy, even if it is just for the cinematography. It kind of had that Oliver Twist feel happening but with a lot more adventure. When I saw the trailer for this film, it really did not give any indication about the content of the film and Emma was not looking forward to seeing it. I was excited just to see what was going on with the 3D. If a commercial boasts that "if you don't see any other film in 3D, you need to see this one"; that peaked my imagination and the film did not disappoint. Asa Butterfield (Hugo Cabret) was as endearing in this film as he was in The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. The relationships Hugo builds throughout the film definitely keeps you interested and wanting to know what happens next. The station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) added both some comic relief and dramatic moments. Sir Ben Kingsley's character, George Melies transforms throughout the film. You could not really decide if you liked him or if you hated him, but all things are revealed in the end. It is really hard to review this film without giving away its essence, but take my word for it; you will not regret going to see it. This film felt like it was very personal for Mr. Scorsese and although it definitely had a storybook feel, I think that anyone who loves movies (like Emma and I do) has to make sure that this one is on their list of films to see. Who would have thought that Marty would be the person that takes 3D films to another dimension? Even James Cameron stated that it was the best 3D effects that he had ever seen; including his own films. I gained a new found respect for the process of movie-making in general. This film does more than just entertains, but it also gives the audience a brief education. The conductor is shouting ALL ABOARD!!!!! This film leaves the train station with a green light.

Greetings again from the darkness. This latest from Martin Scorsese can be fitted with multiple labels and each would be correct: a tribute to the birth of movies, a case for film preservation, a children's fable, a special effects/3D extravaganza, a family movie with touches of Dickens. Very few directors would tackle such an ambitious project and succeed in producing such a magical experience.Based on Brian Selznick's (relative to the film giant David O. Selznick)children's book "The Invention of Hugo Cabret", this is a story of redemption and fulfillment. Asa Butterfield plays Hugo, made an orphan when his watchmaker father (Jude Law) dies in a fire. Hugo gathers up the project he and his dad had been working on, and he moves in with his drunkard Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone). They live in the walls of a 1930's Paris train station and maintain all the clocks, ensuring accurate time. When his uncle disappears, Hugo carries on the daily mission unseen by passengers and station staff. He steals the occasional croissant and milk to survive, all while continuing the mission of repairing the automaton his dad salvaged. Hugo is convinced there is a hidden message from his father that will be revealed when the automaton is fully functioning.Hugo gets cross-ways with a station toy vendor named Georges, played by Sir Ben Kingsley. Georges is a bitter old man and has no time for Hugo the urchin. Chloe Moretz plays Isabelle, a ward unto Georges, and she and Hugo strike up a friendship. Hugo introduces Isabelle to the world of cinema ... previously off-limits to her thanks to Georges. She returns the favor by awakening Hugo to the power of books in a store run by the mysterious, and always great, Christopher Lee. All this is happening while Hugo tries to evade the grasp of the oddly dedicated and slightly twisted station inspector played by Sacha Baron Cohen.The kids' research and automaton revealed hint lead them to a film history book written by Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg). It's here that they discover Georges is really George Melies, the famous pioneer of film who developed the first special effects and studio system. If you know much of film history, then you recognize Melies as the one who brought us the 1902 "A Trip to the Moon". It is here that Scorsese delivers a quick recap of the origination of film, including the Lumiere Brothers, the famous clock stunt by Harold Lloyd and other silent film classics like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. The best portion is dedicated to recreating the system used by Melies to produce films in his make-shift studio.It is here that we are allowed to remember just how magical movies can be and how the best ones fill us with a sense of wonderment. The lines between what we feel and what Scorsese is showing us becomes so blurred it no longer matters. As Isabelle is overwhelmed in the theatre, that same feeling sweeps over us. How interesting that Scorsese's first special effects film features the man who originated film special effects. We even get a re-creation of the famous oncoming locomotive clip that caused audiences to jump. We get it in 3D in Hugo's own station! I have been extremely critical of 3D and its misuse in movies these past couple of years. It rarely adds to the movie and always dims the colors and brightness. Scorsese is a firm believer in the technology and set out to show what can be done and how it can compliment the story. While more impressive than any 3D since Avatar, I still have my doubts about the benefits. What I do know is that if you can overlook the story that drags a bit and the unnecessary 3D effects, you will probably find the film to be quite entertaining and fun to watch. Howard Shore's score plays a vital role and supporting work comes from Emily Mortimer, Richard Griffiths, and Helen McCrory. It's not for the youngest kids, but it will make you feel like a kid ... while reminding you that movies are the stuff that dreams are made of.

Superb, both in its images and its storytelling. Truly magical and touching. It's a bit of a wistful, grave story though, could be hard for some children to get into it, but for the child in the adult, it's amazing. A beautiful way to revisit the history of movie-making. I loved every minute of it. The acting is good, the young actors are excellent, and Ben Kingsley is great. Sacha Baron Cohen strikes the right note and we know from the start that he is the "villain", but that he won't be that awful. Many references in the images and characters reflect some of the earliest films of history. If you're a buff about movie history, you'll have fun discovering theses references throughout the film; if you're not, you'll get to learn some really cool stuff. Go see it!!!

Since I was not familiar with the book, I can't say that I was excited about Hugo, nor was I anxiously awaiting its release, what I was feeling was curiosity about the story's plot and how would the story be handled by Martin Scorsese given that I knew it was nothing like the films he had previously directed. I sat through the first half hour of this film with absolutely no idea where it was going, I soon saw some familiar faces playing in some key roles George Melies (Ben Kingsley), the Station Inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen), Hugo's Father (Jude Law) and amazingly Monsier Labisse (Christopher Lee). I simply applaud Mr. Lee's career, he is truly a marvel to behold, I remember as a child being scared witless by him as Dracula which was filmed before I was born, later for him to be a part of the Star Wars prequels and as the White Wizard Saruman in the Lord of the Rings trilogy it just boggles my mind that he is still delivering great performances in great films and now for my own children to see and appreciate him in these roles. Not to take anything away for the two young actors who basically carry this film, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz). Their on screen interaction was very enthralling. I truly hope that they both see long and fruitful careers as has Mr. Lee. So now that I have done exactly as this film did, and have taken forever to get to the point. I will say that this was a really good story about how the lives of a famed French film maker and a young boy intersect. I did find it amusing that the young protagonists were reading a French book in perfect English, but I'm sure that bit of movie magic was for the benefit of the American audience. I was totally on edge during the scene from the movie poster with Hugo hanging from the clock hand. That scene and many others throughout this story were interesting, provocative and actually did elicit the excitement that I initially lacked in relation to this movie. This film was a visual gem, the opening scene was a cinematic treat. Even with the lengthy start to develop the story, which took more time than I thought was necessary to get to the meat of the story, this is a lovely film for adults who can appreciate the art of film making as do I. It gets a well deserved green light.

Martin Scorsese's first kid's movie falls short of its expectations. After seeing the trailers, my family and I had very high expectations for this movie, and we eagerly went out and saw it in the theaters. We walked out extremely disappointed.First of all, the trailers were completely misleading. My first impression was that the movie was about a boy trying to uncover a great mystery left behind in the wake of his father's death. I thought the movie was going to open up into an enchanting adventure, complete with suspense, action, and magic. I didn't get any of those things. This movie starts out will a long build-up, with the audience waiting for this magical adventure to get underway, only to keep them waiting for another hour or so, where nothing interesting or magical happens.The pacing in the movie is terrible. The movie opens with some stunning visuals, the camera panning over the Paris cityscape and eventually showing us around the train station where the protagonist, Hugo, lives. We get the story of his father's death, and are left with a sense of wonder. We want to know what the automaton is for, why Ben Kingsely's character is so bitter, and what this adventure Hugo promises his little gal-friend is and when it's going to happen. The movie starts and stops, then drags for a bit, then starts, and drags for a long time before grinding to an unsatisfying halt. The adventure doesn't happen. All that waiting around... for nothing.I don't really know what to say about the acting in this movie. Most of the actors had good moments and bad moments. The dialog was lacking. The characters spent more time staring at each other than actually talking. Some of the facial expressions and emotional reactions were a little on the melodramatic side. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Ben Kingsley gets pissy because the two kids find out that he used to make movies? Hugo throws a fit because the automaton didn't work as he expected to? I don't think these were appropriate responses to their situations.The one good thing I have to say about this movie is that the visuals were absolutely gorgeous. From the cold blue lighting in the snowy outdoor scenes, to the orange-y warmth of the train station, to the powerful metallic essence of the gears and clockwork in the tower, this movie has some of the best 3D effects that I've seen since that awful, shallow Avatar. The problem is, the magical visuals cannot make up for the drab and very UN-magical story.Overall, the magical, engaging adventure the trailers promised does not exist. The movie's pace is very slow. Some of the acting is questionable. The visuals were good, but they didn't save the movie. Do not go to this movie expecting something with substance. And definitely do not bring your kids to this movie; they will be bored to tears.

1930's Paris in the winter, two children with a mystery, and nostalgia. All culminate in a movie that arguably is one of the most masterful children's movies of all time. Hugo is about a boy who's father leaves him with only a broken automaton after dying in a terrible accident. This sends him on a miraculous journey, during which Hugo will have a chance to fix more then just the automaton. Hugo is about old films and a time gone by. One can not help but get chills seeing the characters filled with awe by silent black and white films, especially while gazing upon the visual masterpiece in front of you. Hugo is about how beautiful movies can be, in more ways than one. The visuals are astounding and take the work of James Cameron to a whole other level. All these things combined make Hugo a movie miracle, possibly the movie of the year. The dialogue written by the always talented John Logan and the amazing set direction combined with the best use of 3D I have seen yet, causes Hugo to be a touchingly realistic and wonderfully charming fairy tale.

Like clockwork, we are all part of a much larger whole designed to connect with each other and work as one. It's a comforting thought but in a world without spare parts, what happens when you feel you've outlived your value? When you have no purpose? Thus one of the main themes of "Hugo" Martin Scorsese's first foray into PG territory. Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a lonely orphan living in the walls of the Paris train station circa 1930's. While tending to the various clocks around the station, Hugo also has a habit of stealing cogs and widgets from an ornery toy shop clerk Georges (Ben Kingsley). He does this to fix a mechanical atomization his father left him. What it does? Hugo has no idea. When his fathers notes on the machine are taken by Georges in comes his equally precocious goddaughter Isabelle, who helps Hugo discover the purpose of his machine.For those of us who appreciate the art of film, "Hugo" is sure to impress and enchant. The first thing that catches the eye is the color palate which contrasts warm reds and blue hues. Even in the costuming their seems to be very little gray or other bland tones. This creates a Paris with an otherworldly quality enhanced further with competently handled 3D and dazzlingly elaborate camera-work.The second half of the film concerns itself with a topic near and dear to Martin Scorsese's heart; film history and preservation. Homages to various films are slyly inserted and immortalized names from cinema's early era like Lumiere and Melies become an integral part of the story much to any film fanatic's enjoyment. The plot unravels at a deliberate pace and the story itself may prove daunting for some children. But those on Scorsese's wavelength will receive an exciting and elaborate history lesson.Hugo, Isabelle and Georges are linked by a yearning to be accepted and appreciated. At times they feel like Hugo's mechanical man, useless, antiquated, broken. In the end they all find what their looking for by motivating each other, in essence existing for one another which when you think about it, is a pretty good purpose.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/

For very early cinema enthusiasts,those mesmerized by magic, fans mad for Martin Scorsese....anyone who enjoys the pure pleasure of an excellent movie, by all means, this is a film to experience. It's a splendid example of a delightful, feel good, wonderfully made movie. There is perfection everywhere, the movie fairly sparkles with it. The story line combining fact and fiction is a masterful accomplishment. The casting is a total joy... Ben Kingsley's portrayal of a young/old Georges Melies is probably my favorite among his vast list of achievements, and the young lad, Asa Butterfield who is Hugo, will win your heart and break your heart in turn. This will, without question, be nominated as a Best Movie of the Year, because I believe it is exactly that. It truly is a movie not to be missed. You will leave the theater thoroughly satisfied that this was the movie you decided to lay down your money to see. Worth every penny, too!

HUGO dazzled, delighted and inspired me as Scorsese intended. Under the guise of a family film HUGO is really a plea for film preservation. It's as much about the life of pioneer filmmaker Geo. Melies as it is the child Hugo. And it was nice to see both Christopher Lee, whom I had no idea was in the picture prior to seeing it, and the young actress Chloe Grace Moretz a few short years after her breakout role in the fun though ultra violent KICK-ASS.The real stars of the movie were Ben Kingsley and Helen McCrory who play the Melies (husband and wife) during their hey day on stage performing magic tricks and making/starring in (nearly 500) films, then in later years living in obscurity never dwelling on their all but forgotten past. The automaton steals the show in parts and seemed almost lifelike, but Scorsese never crosses the boundary into fantasy. My friend whom I saw HUGO with wanted the automaton to wink at us at the end. I'm glad it didn't! Based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret. While somewhat dramatized, many of the historical details in the film are based on fact. Included are scenes from early cinema, actual footage (bits of A TRIP TO THE MOON are tastefully enhanced with 3-D) from THE GENERAL, SAFETY LAST and other nascent flickers shown being watched by astonished audiences of the time. Overall beautifully done!

My wife and I took our 3 adult children for our traditional Thanksgiving family movie, and we were all disappointed. I think there is a good story, from the book, behind it but it wasn't actually shown well on the screen. It was too mosaic. There are several characters played well by great actors who are not developed well and could have been left out entirely without changing how you "felt" about the main characters or how they changed/grew through the twists and turns of the story. I would have preferred seeing a better written story that better demonstrates the internal changes that the characters are forced to make. I recommend folks go with low expectations.

Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Brian Selznick's inspired novel (which itself was like a pop-up-graphic-regular-novel hybrid, which is the first clue as to why 3D was appropriate) is in just one word: wonderful. It has a lot of drama to it, and not just because it deals with deceased fathers, or supposed deceased father figures, and yet the film also carries the wonder of invention, for things seemingly fantastical (an 'automaton' that is kind of like a robot only with a specific task to be carried out), and overtly fantastical as cinema and the process of invention itself. It ostensibly follows its young hero, Hugo Cabret (a very talented young actor Asa Butterfield), as he hides in the clock- tower of a train station in Paris circa 1933, and how he slowly bonds with a crotchety old shopkeeper (Ben Kingsley) via his much younger relative (Chloe Moretz), and a discovery is made about who this 'Papa Georges' really is. Nothing less than beautiful as a "kids" movie (in quotes since it can be for anyone that just happens to have two kids as its main characters) and as an ode to film- how precious is it, how important artists are, and what the medium is possible for. In fact, this is what makes the 3D not only impressive - it is essential to the craft of the film; where usually 3D is a gimmick used for cheap effect, or when filmmakers don't understand proper visual spacial relations or what depth of field is, Scorsese and the superlative DP Robert Richardson does. Remarkably as well in scenes that showcase what 'Papa Georges' did with his film sets as the director Georges Melies created fantasy realms. Scorsese is one of the only filmmakers - maybe, arguably, the ONLY filmmaker - to understand how to use 3D to his advantage with the space he has. As the man who coined the phrase "Cinema is about what's in the frame and what's out", he takes this gimmick - and it still is a gimmick - and gives it a kick in the ass. And yet it's not just the technique that's impressive here, it serves as the tool for the story, which is about something precious and dear: the old and the new, and being able to make room for both equally. There are other factors that come into play as well, for why Georges Melies wasn't celebrated throughout time and space (and of course sound in cinema and WW1 did a lot for that), but it's really about how to find wonderment in art and life, how the two are more than compatible, they compliment each other. Art feeds life. And ultimately a filmmaker in his 60's like Scorsese connects strongly with the young hero, a figure who finds some comfort in the world of fantasy of the automaton and cinema, and in Papa Georges (not to mention the Michael Stuhlbarg character, who is a film preservationist in the days when film nitrate was the used to make women's shoes).I also neglect to mention some other things in the film, such as Sacha Baron Cohen playing a quasi-bumbling police officer at the train station who with his big dog has a penchant for carting off stray kids to the orphanage. His parts are the stuff of the "B-plotline", but it's still entertaining stuff, and gives a little time to spare between the tragedy that is Hugo's early life (the death of his father played by Jude Law) and the tragedy of Papa Georges' life (when Stuhlbarg shows the surviving film reels to Hugo and others, it's a bittersweet, touching moment, so rare in films these days in general). Overall, it turns into a magical *cinematic* experience, and a deeply emotional one. Thankfully amid the clock-towers and sweeping crane shots and the (swoon) dream-within-dream sequences, there's heart and human beings, and one of Ben Kingsley's most affecting performances in years. There's spectacle in the vision, grace in the action set-pieces (few but significant as they are), and the colors rich and textured in grades of blue, green, red, gold and white. Go see this one.

With all these wonderful and glowing reviews of this film, I can't even believe I saw the same movie. First of all, why do the characters in this film speak with English accents? This is set in Paris, France, not London, England. Secondly, everything visually in this film looks artificial, and the CGI isn't even all that good. 3D moments are few and far between. Corny romantic moments between various characters in the film seem forced and fake. The comedy falls flat on its face, clearly they were geared towards children 5 and under to laugh. The dialogue was weak, and the acting was bland and uninspiring. So what was Scorsese's motivation for doing this movie, if it feels like it was phoned in? Was it greed? Kids movies rake in more money than films that are rated R. Add 3D to it, and you have a better chance for a higher return on investment. Sadly, this film is soulless and boring, and I think it will be something Scorsese will wish he didn't make.This is an add on to the review: Can someone please explain to me how the automaton could have drawn the man in the moon with the rocketship in its eye? Are we to assume that Melies had drawn this image years before he actually made the film? Because he mined the automaton for parts when he was building his first camera, so I can't see him 'reprogramming' it to draw an image from a film he would complete later on.

Recently I had a conversation with a friend who noted that his enjoyment level with a film is often influenced by those he's attending said film with. If his fellow moviegoers are having a good time, he's more inclined to follow suit; if they're less than enthusiastic, so is he. I haven't found that to be the case for me personally, except when it comes to comedies; I'm probably more inclined to laugh hysterically when my cohorts are doing the same. I guess the whole "laughter is contagious" thing is true. But otherwise, I pretty much go my own way and my level of enjoyment is based on my personal experience. However, there have been times when I've had a moment of realization wherein I suddenly become aware that no one else in the theater is as into whatever we're watching as I am. So it is with Hugo. While I became more and more enamored with Martin Scorsese's beautifully crafted ode to film, it became abundantly clear that my friends and the rest of the audience were less than impressed. In some ways, this general disinterest from those around me may have made my appreciation for Hugo even deeper; I almost felt I needed to get up in front of the crowd and defend the film and point out its many merits. Since I did not deliver my speech at that time, I'm afraid we're going to have to cover it in this space.Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) has lived an unfortunate life. When his father (Jude Law) dies in a fire, he is snatched up by his uncle Claude(Ray Winstone), a drunkard who forces him to quit school in order to take up a job repairing the clocks within the Paris train station (and thereby allowing Claude to spend his time at the bottom of a bottle). After Claude disappears, Hugo finds himself living all alone within the walls of the depot, always mindful of staying out of the sight of the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). In his limited spare time, Hugo uses the skills his superior mechanical skills working on the repair of an automaton his father found in a museum attic shortly before his death, a machine he believes will deliver a message from his father. To make it work, Hugo begins stealing gears and parts from a small store and soon draws the ire of its proprietor, Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley). Georges allows him to work off his debt by repairing things in the shop and soon this job leads to a friendship with Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), who happens to own a key that fits the automaton perfectly. But instead of a message from his father, the automaton draws a picture that traces back to Georges and leads Hugo and Isabelle on a journey of great discovery.To boil the plentiful elements and concepts contained within Hugo into a few paragraphs is a tough task. It is a tremendously complex film with a wide range of plots and purposes that don't always interact in the most straightforward way. It is all at once a poignant family film, a coming of age film, an adventure epic, and an extremely personal homage. The mix of genres is a strong indicator as to why Hugo is having such a hard time finding an audience. Its rating and the inclusion of the 3D component make it an obvious draw for families but the truth is, this is not a film kiddos are going to enjoy. (Case in point: the young boy sitting behind me who spent the entire second half of the film telling his mother in a not-so-quiet voice that he wanted to go home.) This is the rare "children's movie" that's actually made for adults, designed to make us remember how magical everything could be when we were younger. So, basically, Scorsese's take on a family movie.Hugo is a deep and nuanced film that draws you in a little more with each passing scene. It starts slow (too slow, honestly) but builds consistently to the climax that, for me at least, delivered tenfold on the promises made throughout the runtime. As the movie progresses, Scorsese seems to be asking the audience to invest in Hugo's struggles, a call to action I had no problem responding to. Butterfield provides a quality performance that peaks at the right times and his relative lack of experience is tempered quite well by Moretz, who always displays a maturity beyond her years. Their dynamic works well and Scorsese does an excellent job of relying on his young stars just enough to draw the audience's attention but not so much as to put too much pressure upon them. The supporting actors, particularly Kingsley and Michael Stuhlbarg, all play their parts with subtle flair and each does a great job of highlighting the main characters. The surrounding story lines, while a bit distracting in the early going, come together with precision to expand the film's narrative andBut where Hugo truly excels is when it delves into the world of the early cinema. A forgotten filmmaker, Georges has retreated within himself and locked away the many painful memories that came from his post-war exile. It falls to Hugo and Isabelle, along with the help of a film expert (played exquisitely by Stuhlbarg) to reawaken Georges' love of film. Scorsese uses this piece of storytelling to unveil his own admiration for the early films and the further he takes Hugo into this realm, the more enamored with his work I became. It is a supremely well- made, beautifully shot film (as all Scorsese films are) that is nearly overpowering in its personal nature. You get the impression that Scorsese loves this film and wants you to love it as well. I only wish more viewers would join me in reciprocating that love.Please check out my reviews at ieatfilms.com

Though it is based on a kid's book, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, I have a hard time thinking of Hugo as a movie for kids. This isn't a movie that you scarf down like a Whopper or a Big Mac, it's a movie that you savor, that you relish, and much of that is due to what your eyes are witnessing. Breathtaking sets and masterful use of 3D draw you into the story, but I'm not sure that is enough to captivate children the age of the protagonist and title character, Hugo Cabret.There's a key scene halfway through Hugo's journey where it is explained to him that there are just some things that he's too young to understand, and I can't help but wonder if that might be true of the audience at which this very mature, very visceral journey that Scorsese has painted for us is aimed. This film moves at a rather slow pace through the first half, if not 2/3rds of the tale, but the payoff is all the greater for it, assuming you're old enough to appreciate the history being portrayed. I imagine there are plenty of kids who have seen it already who were expecting something a bit faster paced and closer to what they are used to, and were disappointed. Most of them probably don't even realize that it's actually based on (loosely, but rather accurately at the same time!) the real life of Georges Méliès, who was known as the "Cinemagician" because he was, basically, the father of "special effects." So wait, you might ask... Is this a film about a kid named Hugo, or about the early days of cinema? It's both.And it's wonderful. It truly is a love letter to cinemaphiles, and I'd rather not give away any more than that, because that's only slightly more than I knew going into it, and in my experience, the less I know about or expect from a movie, the more likely I am to enjoy it. Just know that you really should see it in 3D. I know people are tiring of it lately, but it really does play an integral role in this film, and if nothing else, your eyes will thank you.

This movie is a homage to the invention of movies (especially to Georges Mèliés). For all I know, much of this is available to film school students; for the rest of us, this is as good as it will ever get, far better than even serious amateur cinephiles have much chance of seeing. Hugo is a real live breathing movie, not at all a pedantic history lesson or a viewing of archival footage; but all those history lessons and archival footage are woven in.I happened to be reading a book on the history of film when I saw this, and several of the still photographs from the book came alive as fully moving pictures occupying the whole screen: Arrival of a Train, Workers Leaving the Lumiére Factory, A Trip to the Moon, The Great Train Robbery, Intolerance, and more that I didn't immediately recognize. There are also bits of early animation techniques: a "flip book" and a "lightning sketch" drawn live on stage. We're shown a library and museum of very old movie research and memorabilia and equipment, including a hand cranked projector with a a rotating butterfly shutter wheel to block the light between frames.The production is thoroughly modern, using giant realistic sets with hundreds of extras and some CGI magic. (One nice bit of CGI is watching a glass studio building age over several years in real life from proud use to derelict, very believably and all in the space of only about twenty seconds of screen time.) There's no feeling of being confined to either a sound stage or a frame here; there are believable aerial views of Paris nearly a century ago.At the same time as the film is thoroughly modern, the story "feels" like those very first movies: Many of the principal characters wear garish colored costumes that stand quite apart from what everyone else is wearing, reminiscent of the way some of those old movies were hand-tinted. The sets are huge and unmistakably simple, yet intimately detailed at the same time. Each bit of architecture in isolation is quite believable, yet taken all together it can only be a fantasy. Today we'd call the story a melodrama; the personalities of the principal characters are exaggerated; and there are plenty of thrilling foot-chases and sight gags. Things are not so far over-the-top as to be hard to believe, yet they're plain enough so it would be clear what the general outline of the plot is and who the "bad guy" is even if there weren't any sound. (Yet, there are a few things not found in the old movies too: one would never expect to find any Freudian personality subtleties in old movies, yet here they are in "our" movie.) What we see is a seamless combination of new footage of this movie, clips of restorations of old movies, and thoroughly convincing modern recreations of parts of old movies. The blending is always believable and realistic: For one example, many of the restoration clips are screened as movies within the movie. For another example, some of the characters in what appear to be old movies are recognizably the same as the characters in the "new" movie. For a third example, a few times the camera starts by showing us a bit of an old movie, but then draws back to show us the whole old studio creating that bit (including quite a few insights into early special effects).A few visual idioms are repeated to emphasize they're still current: First we're shown the original, then we're shown how it fits into a modern story. The man hanging precariously from the hands of a high outdoor clock may be the best example. First some of the characters sit in a movie theater and watch the original on the screen. That fairly long screening shows what leads up to it, with scaling a brick wall, standing on a ledge, and a bit of slapstick with a window that opens by revolving. Later, one of the characters in "our" movie hides by going outdoors and hanging from the hands of a tower clock we're familiar with in "our" movie.

This film was playing in a theater that I frequented during my childhood, and I was quite excited to see it based on the reviews I read RIGHT HERE. It was a disappointment. The robot was the most exciting character. The special effects were good-- not great. The sound quality was muffled, and many times I could not hear what was being said. The story line was pointless and boring, and I could not wait for it to end, like a joke without a punch line. I fought through the urge to fall asleep toward the end of the movie. 8.6 average user rating? You're dreaming. At least this film would be better than watching a film by George Melies. Who decided to make this person's primitive films the subject of a movie anyway? That's like going to a museum to see art work by chimpanzees.

Tackling 3D for the first time, I think Scorsese has hit the ball out of the park with Hugo, his film was gorgeous. Unfortunately he forgot to give us a compelling story. Hugo is a noble film, but it is never quite sure what kind of film it wants to be. It is a little too mature to be a kids movie, yet it's too cartoonish to be an adult movie. One minute, it is played as a fantasy in the kind of world where the moon is bigger than the Eiffel Tower, and the next minute the film is played realistically; a serious biography of one of cinema's pioneers. Indeed Hugo's best quality after it's look, is its educational factor. How Ironic it is to be watching bits of hundred year old George Melies films on a cinematic format that was almost invented yesterday. The photography was diverse and spectacular, the characters were charming and quirky, but in the end, the movie just wasn't compelling enough. I went in expecting to laugh and cry in all the right places, and I didn't. I guess that's more Spielberg's terrain; Scorsese is much colder than that of course. Hugo is pleasant, but it's not a great movie

I liked this movie from the start, although I did have issues with it. The basic idea of a kid living in the infrastructure of a train station is really cool, and his home, with a million gears, is extraordinary. At the same time, I was put off by an early chase scene in which a rather cartoonish villain chases after Hugo. It felt very much like something you'd see in a kid's movie, and while Hugo is very kid friendly, for the most part it does not fall into kid movie clichés. But there are a few, and the chase is one of them.While the whole living in a clock thing is cool, I felt the movie really took off when it started focusing on the second part of the story, which I won't give away. My girlfriend thought this might be where it would lose kids, but I don't think so. The movie becomes better and better, and is really fascinating and touching by the end.

Before we judge an old cynic too quickly, perhaps we should stop and think whether there is a human story behind their bitter exterior, perhaps a lifetime of lost dreams. Such is the case in for Georges, the cranky toy store owner (Ben Kingsley), in Martin Scorsese's Hugo, who turns out to have a secret that he has been hiding for many years. Set in Paris in 1931 and based on the children's novel, The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, Hugo is the story of an orphan boy who lives in the walls of the train station, the Gare Montparnasse, and spends his time winding clocks, a skill taught to him by his alcoholic uncle (Ray Winstone) after his father (Jude Law) died in a fire.Shot in 3-D by cinematographer Robert Richardson, the depiction of the train station is perfectly realized, especially its feverish activity and imposing Roman statues and figures in the piazza. The boy, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), survives by stealing food from the station's kiosks while trying to avoid the threatening Station Inspector, Gustav (Sacha Baron Cohen). It seems that Gustav, having been raised in an orphanage himself, thinks that all boys without parents belong there. Hugo of course has a different opinion and spends his days observing people at the station.These include Lisette (Emily Mortimer), a flower seller and scholarly librarian Monsieur Labisse (Christopher Lee) among others. Gustav and Lisette develop a relationship, but a leg injury suffered during the war makes him a reluctant suitor, though more of his human qualities begin to surface. Hugo likes to fix things that are broken and steals parts to repair a discarded automaton with a sad face that his father retrieved from a museum's trash bin. Hugo believes that once the automaton is repaired, the machine will be able to write a coded message to him from his father. He steals one too many mechanical parts from the toy store owner, however, who keeps the boy's notebook that provides crucial instructions on how to fix the automaton.Begging for the cantankerous Georges to return his treasured notebook, he develops a friendship with Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), the George's goddaughter and his wife (Helen McCrory). Isabelle loves adventure and finds a suitable partner in Hugo who likes movies and they both sneak into the cinema where a Harold Lloyd film is playing until they are thrown out. Hugo tells Isabelle that "broken machines make me sad," and ponders the idea that if every part in a machine has a purpose, then he must also have a purpose in life, a wise observation. The film "switches gears" in its second half and becomes a plea for film preservation and a tribute to the beginning of cinema and to those pioneer directors who created an industry that no one thought would last.Film historians will marvel at the showing of silent classics such as "A Trip to the Moon" and the work of such luminaries as the Lumière brothers, Edwin S. Porter, D. W. Griffith, and others, though the films have been recreated in 3-D rather than restored. Through the efforts of Hugo, Isabelle and Monsieur Labisse, however, the story of Georges' secret life is revealed and his bitterness is transformed into gratitude with radiant results. Hugo is by and large a family film and, since the majority of Scorsese's films have been R-rated, this is probably his first film that has been accessible to a wider audience.Although the film is designed for children, much of the material is too adult for them and the presence of Gustav's huge Doberman Pinscher coming directly at the audience in 3-D is enough to scare even adults half to death. Perhaps Scorsese thinks that it's a good thing for children to have nightmares. While Hugo is undoubtedly a technical marvel, it feels to me like a perfect wind-up toy that has all its parts functioning perfectly but lacks the button that would bring it to life. While the performance of Asa Butterfield is certainly adequate, he is not particularly captivating and there is little dramatic tension in the film once the mystery is solved, except for a few dreams and an obligatory chase scene.Unlike such classics as The Black Stallion or National Velvet, there is little here that reminds us of childhood. Hugo and Isabelle talk and act like little adults not children. A film such as Hugo might have been better in a simple and straightforward manner, not bloated with extraneous conversations, an over-abundance of characters, and dazzling 3-D effects that ultimately do not add much to the viewer's overall satisfaction. I think, however, Hugo may become a classic but for all the wrong reasons. It will be studied mainly for its stunning technical achievements, its excellent use of the 3-D medium, and its colorful lessons in film history. When children are looking for magic, however, they may turn elsewhere.

WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : HUGUMINI-REVIEW : Never was there a more beautiful movieRATING : See it in theaters and in 3D (Rating System: "See it in theaters", "Wait for the instant download", "Don't waste your time")Hugo (Asa Butterfield, "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas") is an orphan living in a Paris railway station in 1938. His father was a museum curator and watchmaker. Before his death, Hugo's father had found an automaton (mechanical man) which he and Hugo were attempting to fix. By night, Hugo keeps the clocks in the railway station running. Hugo steals parts from a toymaker (Ben Kingsley) who catches on to Hugo and mentors him. The toymaker is godfather to young orphan Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz, "Kick-Ass") who befriends Hugo and insists on seeing his home. Hugo agrees and shows her the automaton and together they get it to work. The first thing it draws is a picture from a movie that Hugo used to watch with his father. And we're off. . .This is without a doubt the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. Every detail of this film has been made with the utmost care and love. Even the snowflakes are amazing. I saw it in 3D and it is the first 3D movie I have seen that uses 3D artistically, not as a gimmick. There are scenes where the camera runs us through a crowd, and we feel as if we are there, brushing past bystanders. The sets look and sound real. The clockworks within the tower clock and automaton are as real as any wind up clock you know. If director Martin Scorsese had intended to create a masterpiece, then he has succeeded.The children (Butterfield, Moretz) are heartbreakingly beautiful. They give performances that exude the innocence of youth and a constant sense of urgency. Butterfield in particular plays Hugo as a tortured youngster with a passion for fixing things. In Hollywood movies it is so easy to play young people as wise beyond their years and / or smart- alecky. Instead, these children are three-dimensional with purpose and wonder.It turns out that this film is not so much the story of an orphan boy, but a wonderful homage to one of film's great pioneers. We get a retrospective of the early days of film and a film history lesson without even knowing it. Scorsese takes up the gauntlet of film innovators who came before and makes his mark in film history by crafting a 3-D movie others will aspire to match. This is clearly an Academy Award winner and instant classic.So for wonderful acting, amazing effects, beautiful set design, creative storytelling, and a loving tribute to a historical film legend, you must "see it in the theater."

I'm about as far away from a Scorcese fan as you can get. In my book he targets the lowest common denominator via a combination of foul language and violence. True, there have been exceptions. I went to see New York, New York, despite antipathy to the two leads, because it was about Jazz in the immediate post-war years; verdict: ho-hum. A little later he made Age Of Innocence and I went because I was almost certain that he would be unable to insert his winning parlay (scatological violence) without radically altering Edith Wharton's stylistic novel. Verdic: slightly less ho-hum. I was sold on Hugo because I read that 1) it was set in Paris which meant it would have to be seriously bad to counteract the City of Light and 2) considerable footage was devoted to Cinema itself. Scorcese is well-documented as both loving and being an expert on movies so it is almost certain that he is familiar with Amelie and it is equally certain that he has, to some extent, remade it with a male protagonist. Amelie, if you recall, was a catalyst surrounded by sad people who needed 1) a nudge to bring them together or 2) some form of healing. Hugo is also a catalyst surrounded by people who need help getting together - Sacha Baron Cohen/Emily Mortimer, Richard Griffiths/Frances de la Tour - and healing - Ben Kingsley. Viewed in these terms it can be said that both catalysts succeed admirably but, it has to be said, when is a rip-off not a rip-off? possibly when it's a sacred cow doing the ripping-off. The 3D is used effectively and Christopher Lee supplies the best performance, counteracting the film's worst performance by Ben Kingsley. The protagonist, alas, Asa Butterfield, is as mechanical as the clock he tends so devotedly and by far the best thing on view is the actual vintage footage.

Is it the story? No. Is it the actors? No. Is it the cinematography? No. Just what is it that makes this movie so hard to sit through or not take a little nap in? Well, I am not sure exactly, but to put it crudely: its just too long and boring. It is also a bit misleading. You are expecting something magical and more fantastical. You are expecting the clockwork man that Hugo finds to reveal perhaps something else and come alive. Yet, it never really does. Its very sad to come away with a feeling like that with so much substance and so many great performances. My advice is to rent it when it comes out on DVD when you have time to pause or stop it and make a snack or go to the bathroom. Its very hard to sit through. If you are thinking to take your child to it, forget it! This is an adults only movie because it is somewhat sophisticated and somewhat artsy...and yes, long and boring!

Film should have been called Georges Méliès not HugoWell where shall I start. I took the family to see this and we were led to believe this was a fantastic fantasy adventure ( according to the previews ) It started slow, crawled along and fizzled at the end. Although it looked fantastic, with great acting, the story was weak an none existent. My 12 year old son fell asleep and my 7 year old daughter drifted in an out of concentration.Very frustrated. The only person who gave anything to this film was Mr Baron Cohen, truly a talented actor. We always make a big thing out of a trip to the cinema to see a film in the festive period. Apart from a bit of snow there was nothing festive about this film. I am truly amazed at the promotion of this film not since the blair witch have i been duped so much, i left the theatre feeling cheated and very annoyed, with two children that were less than impressed as wellStory oh my god what story !!!!! Felt more like an ITV easter special

Hugo is a film that enchants the heart and also captivates the mind. It tells its story interwoven with a fascinating history lesson about Georges Méliès, an innovative French filmmaker. It is as much a film for adults as it is children. When we discover the fate of many of Méliès' films, we feel genuine sadness for him after all his endeavours, and we really feel a sense of the freshness of film as a medium as it was then.The images in Hugo are of course stunning! There is a real charm, beauty and inventiveness to this film, fitting, given that "Méliès is sometimes referred to as the First "Cinemagician" (Wikipedia). Ben Kingsly is a mesmerising presence as Georges Méliès, and Sacha Baron Cohen as the station inspector is also fabulous! There is a beautiful message in this film about what can happen when you allow yourself to heal and move forward in life. I came out of the cinema feeling inspired. Hugo is a breath of fresh air, weaving together a narrative of broken machines and broken people and the beginning of their healing, through the actions of one small boy who stands up for what he believes in. *****spoilers below!*****As an addendum I wanted to add a comment in response to the people complaining that we don't get to see the automaton do very much, that the film builds a sense of expectation that is never fully realised. We don't *need* the added FX of seeing the automaton fly into action at the end of the film -- the magic has already been created in the healing journey for the central characters. Not only that, but what is left to the imagination often works far more powerfully than the actual images themselves ever could (we've just been conditioned by Hollywood into thinking otherwise). For those who like a good, fast, action film, with lots of stuff getting blown up, you probably won't like this. But for anyone else, give it a try. This film is great sleight-of-hand by Scorsese, he builds us up believing something might happen with the automaton, and yet we suddenly see the story was really about something else far more important all along. *Do* take your children because if they can sit through this they mightn't be as willing to consume the tired, formulaic excuse for films that we get bombarded with nowadays.

It may seem odd that a movie about the magic of cinema, in an age where cinema proved itself to be more than just a fad, the 1920s, would be made utilizing 3D, a gimmick that seems to be all the rage today. This gets lampshaded by one particular scene, where the audience watches a scene where a train pulls into a station and flips out, as they think the train is coming for them. Yet, given the subject matter, it only seems inevitable that a man like Martin would think up such an idea for such a plot, anyway.Based off the book "The Invention of Hugo Cabret", which is a stunning mix of hand drawings and writing, and set in 1920s Paris, the film "Hugo" tells the story of Hugo Cabret, a young orphan who works and lives in the clock tower of a train station, which is ruled by a ruthless inspector, and is also where he has been stealing several toys for their parts to fix a broken automaton, made for the movies of Georges Méilès. One day, when caught trying to steal a toy, the owner notices Hugo's notebook, which contains conceptual sketches for the automaton, and steals it, to which Hugo tries to get back.But Hugo instead meets Uncle Georges' adoptive daughter, who helps him try to get the notebook back. But through all this, they both end up in the mystery surrounding the automaton, and movies. Isabelle hasn't seen a movie, and after a stint in a cinema, they find out that film itself is what keeps drawing them closer and closer in this spider's web... and so begins an adventure for the two where they discover themselves, the joy of movies, and the need to stick together in the face of adversity.Wow... What a film. Honestly, I don't think I've seen a movie like this at all. I always knew you could count on Marty to blow your mind, and here he really has outdone himself. I was left speechless after the movie- honestly I don't think I've been left with that feeling in ages.Everything about this movie is just brilliant. First, the acting is STELLAR. Asa Butterfield plays the titular character so heartbreakingly beautifully. He puts so much pain and emotion into his performance that it's as mesmerizing as it is heartbreaking. He is a great actor with the eyes too, and he really showed it here... Every melancholy expression of his had me on the verge of tears (and I'm a very manly guy!!!). Moertz... Well, we knew she was amazing when we saw her in Kick-Ass!, and she is especially brilliant here. Cohen is his usual funny self, let's face it: he was made for the comic roles. He does brilliantly here. But best of all is Kingsley... Oh man. Word to all directors ever: if you don't want your audience reduced to sobbing messes, never have Ben Kingsley play a broken old man, ever. We all know he's an amazing actor. But here, he gives his most devastatingly beautiful performance ever. I cried in a few places, he is that phenomenal.The plot? Well, you knew already it's great. But my synopsis does not do it justice, believe me. Absolutely beautifully done.The cinematography is perfect, and the 3D is amazing. This is the best 3D I've seen in any movie, ever. It helps tell the story, for once- it helps a movie about the magic of filmmaking, that should say something. This must be seen in a 3D cinema, I mean that. Every single detail is exposed, there's several moments where its like you're looking through a window. I think Scorsese made a wise choice to shoot in 1:85.1, too. That helped give the movie the old timey feel it aimed for. I will definitely add this film to my Blu ray collection, even if it's just to show off my HD equipment for family members visiting in the future.And another thing- the feel of the movie is perfect. This is a film made for us who go to a movie to immerse ourselves in it. To escape from reality and indulge in this world being brought forth to us. Not since TRON: Legacy have we gotten a film as magical as that, and I did not want this movie to end at all.In short, do not miss this film. If you're tired of brainless blockbusters and dialogue driven movies that turn them into videotaped plays, and want a film that sums up why we go to the cinema, see this movie. You will regret having missed it, if you don't, and that I guarantee.Bravo, Scorsese. You have re-proved yourself as a favourite filmmaker of mine.OVERALL: 10/10THE GOOD: Everything!THE BAD: ...the fact that it had to end. :(

3-D movies have been in the mainstream for a few years now but I've never been compelled to see one in that format. So given the choice today, I stuck with 2-D and when all was said and done, I was suitably impressed. The period setting and particularly the workings of young Hugo Cabret's (Asa Butterfield) clock tower home were visually stunning to me; all those gears and wheels working together harmoniously together conveyed a sense of logic and purpose to the unfolding story. What I wasn't expecting was director Scorsese's unbridled tribute to cinema as an art form when the picture steers a path toward the life work of film maker George Melies (Ben Kingsley). Reaching all the way back to the silent film era, Scorsese makes a connection with all those great directors of a time gone by - Chaplin, Keaton, Griffith - and I found myself enjoying snippets of their own pictures interspersed throughout the story.As for the principals, I found the youngsters Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz providing the heart for this picture, aiding the Kingsley character Papa George to cast off the despondency of his current life to relive the glory of an earlier time. Now had I known Sacha Baron Cohen was in this film, I might have stayed away from it altogether as I'm no fan of Borat. But he gives an interesting and amusing performance here as the train station inspector attempting to make a connection of his own with the fetching flower girl Lisette (Emily Mortimer). He provides a nuance to the character that I wasn't expecting given the absurdity of some of his previous work.Virtually every other review I've read about the film on this board mentions it's relevance as a kids' movie, but somehow I didn't get that sense while I was watching it. It doesn't present a childish theme or approach it's subject matter in a juvenile way; in fact my impression was that a real young child might have to have a fair amount of the story explained to him or her. Certainly the areas of the picture dealing with the silent film era, including the recovered Melies reels would be almost boring for a young viewer. However considering my overall impression with the picture coming out of the theater today, I'd have to say that I'm ready to make that mental leap of faith by seeing my first 3-D film, and it very well may be "Hugo".

(No spoilers here so don't worry) Took my partner to see Hugo 3D tonight we were supposed to go with some friends but decided I wanted this to be a personal film. Now this being my first written/typed review I think Hugo is a perfect film to start with as I have been so anxious to see it trying my best to stay away from reviews etc. If you have heard that this film is not for children its mostly correct I am 25 & at times felt to young but at the same time was thinking that if I had a son/daughter this would be the first film I would want them to see. If your going to take a group of children think again as they may find it boring.Hugo is a nice film you can tell that a lot of passion has gone into it. Visuals are awesome story is great and you get a bit of a history lesson too. It didn't have that Spielberg magic to it though you know like the first time you watched E.T. This was disappointing to me. I am a massive Scorsese fan & in my opinion should stick to the drama/crime as they have all felt epic and stuck with me. The 3D is good in this film as you have probably heard also but I do not care for it much anymore.To sum it up yeah Hugo is a nice film maybe not one for the kids but the 3D may wow them for the length. Performances were great. To me this is a personal film with a lot of heart. But will not really entertain you or maybe it will. Just go see it.

Scorceses first foray into 'childrens' movies is his best since the Departed, and gives Kingsley his best performance since 'Sexy Beast'.The film is a love affair of all things cinema, but the Auteur doesn't let you in on this until late in the second act.The titular character lives in a dreamlike train station, keeping the clocks to the correct time, watching the everyday lives of the people who work there, and trying to stay one step ahead of the station agent.The events that led Hugo to live there are tragic though. His father was killed in a fire and his uncle took him into his 'care'. Before the tragedy, Hugo and his father were in the middle of restoring a clockwork man, which when working, had the ability to write.But despite all this, Hugo strives to complete the restoration, despite stealing parts from the toymaker. But one thing is missing, a key shaped like a heart, that will reveal everything and maybe a little more about the everyday people who work on the station....The film is flawless, everything you would expect from a film released at this time of year, but with the added class of Scorcese. Again the man has tackled different forms of cinema (3D) a has given the film something other 3D movies don't give, intimidation, warmth, a personality.From the Burtonesque external sets, to the 'in your face' moment when the station agent asks the two children what they are doing, the 3D is an important part of the film and in some cases even the narrative. This maybe because Scorcese is saying 'yes it's all good and well using 3D' but look what they did when all this was fresh, and people were not bothered about budgets and reaping profit'.It's a decidedly heavy subject for young children, but my six year old was dazzled at the scenery, cinematography, and appeared to be awe-inspired at the footage of the old movies.The storytelling is amazing, you are constantly thinking 'where are they going with this' but as the narration explains, the answer is all in the key. Kingsley is amazing as the pioneer, and I wouldn't be surprised if he is up for an award sometime soon.Moretz and Butterfield are too excellent as the children on the quest, and look comfortable acting alongside veterans such as Lee, Lae, Winstone, and Mortimer.Cohen fares well, his conversations with the chief are one of the highlights of the film, but he comes across a little too Clouseau and sounds like Boyce from Only fools and Horses.But believe me, this is one of the years best movies, and has flawless narration and is beautiful to look act, whilst educational for young ones too, teaching them that simplicity can be good too.

I was keen to see this film from its publicity posters. I thought the clock looked like the clock on the Musee d'Orsay art gallery in Paris, which used to be Quay d'Orsay railway station, near the river Seine. I have since found out the railway station is Gare Montparnasse. What a treat to have the whole thing re-created in this beautiful film. There are so many facets to it, that I can only give an overall impression. I was totally engaged from the beginning. I wasn't sure about the 3D until I was completely amazed by the effects, especially sparks from the brakes of a locomotive which seemed to fly out into the audience and the smoke which appeared to linger in the auditorium. How brilliant is that! I love the cameos of station life, the flower girl with the fresh flowers which came in on the early train, the zealous gendarme with the mechanical leg, the lady with the dog and her admirer. Those who linger on the station like the smoke from the engines and those who pass through, hardly noticing anything. This film has everything to engage the enthusiast such as re- created steam locomotives, books and an Aladin's cave of a bookshop (like Shakespeare and Co). It demonstrates the mechanics of early film making, weaving the pioneers of the art into the story with a skill which engaged me completely, and tying it into the intricate mechanics of clockwork, a theme which runs through the film. Hugo is crafted to achieve an appeal to all generations. Our family group ages ranged from 8 to 65 and we were all completely bowled over with it. The whole story is carefully explained using the medium of quality film. Wonderful!

I went into this film knowing that its was a Scorsese film and that it wouldn't be for kids witch made me more intrigued to watch it. I knew it was going to be long and i am not a big fan of 3D films but i got over that because of the great reviews that i had read. whilst i am a martin Scorsese fan i was a little disappointed by this movie because of all the hype that it had got witch i believe it did not deserve. It was beautifully filmed and you could see how much work martin put into it which i really appreciated and there was top notch acting from every single actor in the movie. If this film was shorter and maybe a slightly better storyline it would have got an eight or higher but i still recommend this movie to any movie lovers out there but do not take your kids because they will be very board by the end of this movie.

This is a good film, as demonstrated by many of the reviews below. But it could have been great. The imagery, core story and 3D features are very well done. But watching the film, I kept getting annoyed by the constant clichés and odd plot choices.For instances, why in a French setting are most of the actors English and American? The constant mix of accents is annoying. There is even a scene where they are reading a French book, but in English.There is the drunk uncle, innocent flower girl, mean inspector, odd romance between two completely superfluous characters in the train station. So many of these characters and their roles seemed like add-ons at best.Finally, I wish they had cast another kid in the lead role. I didn't find the choice to be particularly believable or interesting. I still give this film a 7/10, which tells you how good are some of the other elements, but it could have been a great film.

"Hugo" has Martin Scorsese master the children's adventure movie genre. Scorsese's 2010 hit was "Shutter Island" where he mastered the suspense thriller by paying attention to every detail in the film. Here, the camera is in the walls of a 1930s train station in Paris where we see the inner workings of clocks, an automaton, and an orphan boy looking for a key. It's also in 3D and is about the history of filmmaking.Visually, this is a masterpiece. Easily the best 3D movie released in recent memory, if not of all time. There is seamless merging between computer-generated graphics and real sets. Conceptually, this is very impressive. As Hugo is on one of his adventures, he starts finding connections to old films. These are not just fictional films that help the story along. Scorsese is actually telling us the history of filmmaking and uses the real footage of important films. He even rendered these real films in 3D. I don't know how he does it.Story wise, "Hugo" suffered. It meandered a lot, never quite deciding which little adventure to start, or solve, or finish. A trick that I have learned in screen writing is to use a time frame to set the story in, a ticking clock as some might say. Ironically, for a film that had more actual ticking clocks than any other, they didn't give their story one.One has to question if this was really meant to be a children's movie. The over two-hour run time sent the younger kids crying into the arms of their mothers as exhaustion set in. And as the story moved away from an orphan boy on an adventure to the history of filmmaking, it became quite dry for the older kids. I found Hugo, our hero, to be a snotty kid who didn't even want to tell us what he was up to in the beginning, but at least the kids liked him. And I, at least, had the history of filmmaking to amuse me immensely.I don't think "Hugo" was just supposed to be the history of filmmaking, but the magic of it. For those of us who love films, it certainly was magical. Hugo, the young boy, was removed from discovering the magic because his little adventure was mostly solved by the time we got into it. Unfortunately, I think this removes the kids in the audience from discovering the magic of it. But the kids can have fun watching a robot while the adults are educated — perhaps that is what makes "Hugo" so special.Conveniently, both "Hugo" and The Artist" are supposed to be the big winners of awards season this year, both were released the same month, and both have something to say about movies. After you watch "Hugo" and are introduced to the earliest films of the Lumière brothers and Georges Méliès, watch "The Artist" it picks up where "Hugo" left off and introduces us to stars of silent films, the golden age of Hollywood.

I have heard people say Martin Scorsese, it seems, wouldn't have made a film like this. I want to direct anybody about these qualms on that "kiddie film" idea to watch "A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through the American Movies". To put it in a laconic way, Scorsese was predestined to make a film like this. What makes it enchanting and close to home is that the film is a fable per se; underneath it, though, is Scorsese's true love for films.The film is based upon a book about Hugo Cabaret, which Johnny Depp had in production for a couple of years now. Martin Scorsese was commissioned to direct and the result is a lavish design with an amazing stellar cast including Ben Kingsley who portrays George Melies with bathos and subtlety, Christopher Lee who plays a book keeper, Asa Butterfield as Hugo and Chloe Grace Moretz as Isabelle. Even the minor role by Ray Winstone as Claude the Uncle becomes momentous to the story. I think the real thing that came to mind for me was that 3D wasn't subordinate to the story or concurrent to the story IT WAS THE STORY. If you have ever seen Yasujiro Ozu's films or "Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles" (1975) and films by Akira Kurosawa and even Orson Welles that you'll fathom out that film has ALWAYS been Three Dimensional. What Scorsese done with his amazing crew was that every spatial part of the foreground would be shot with depth of field. Melies at his celebration talking about what Scorsese would refer to as "the illusionist" the magic tricks he would pull with Mermaids and Magicians, it's as though he has been cut out and is sticking out the screen (to use a cliché).The magic of cinema, the montages of the films to decipher "Papa Georges" despair, the film follows a young boy, who tries to fix an automaton. He constantly evades an inspector and always runs the clock in its amazing interior (referencing "Safety Last!" in terms of cinematic iconography) that his Uncle Claude does. His Father is no longer with him after a fire, while he was trying to fix an automaton, which his son subsequently has tried to fix using bits and bobs he can purloin from shops like George's shop. What's amazing is that throughout there's pervasive hints as to who this mysterious man is such as the poster, which seems to be showing "A Trip to the Moon" (though it's in French so you can't tell).The film is relatively simple, though its tale of history is extremely pivotal to its anniversary of over 100 years now. Reduxing the Melies sets is wonderfully done through flashback and even little moments like Baron Cohen (playing the inspector who's basically a Keystone Cop in my opinion) constantly having pratfalls and pitfalls on the train station can actually feel more interactive as though his feet are sticking right out at us. Scorsese has not only proved the potential of this gimmicky device, but he's also used it to counterpoint with the old technology as an ardent student still learning his craft as he says. It could be up there with his great films ("Mean Streets", "Taxi Driver" and even "Casino").The person I went with to the cinema had prior to it been told about Melies by me. I was oblivious to the premise being central to this Man; my reasons for talking about were because I was showing him primitive versions of Joan of Arc because I'm always interested in Dreyer's version, but I think that the way it branches out is fascinating. I then drew to the 1899 version of Jeanne D'arc by George Melies and how beautiful it was in its grainy hand painted form and I was telling him how Melies' anger caused him to burn the first carbon copies of his films. And then I get even more history on it in this film with so much poignancy about "reinventing the wheel" and basically the guile of the artist. For example, Scorsese plays with the dream sequences at one point; the boy tries to get something off the tracks and the train comes straight to him like an old suspense thriller from the silent era with Pickford or Gloria Swanson; though it was different here. The swishing of the train is emphasized as it crashes right through the building and then it's contrasted later on as if it was breaking the forth wall for a couple of minutes in my opinion.It will be the first time you'll see Intolerance in this format, The General, "Trip to the Moon" and even Edwin S. Porter's "The Great Train Robbery" in this format. Even the projector in the cinema where Isabelle and Hugo go for an adventure flashes right out at the audience as we dabble into true magic. What an experience and I will note though that it will be tardy and slow paced for some. But it was simply rewarding in the end.

Hugo Cabret has been so obscenely overrated by many "Bandwagon" Reviewers that it is sickening! Just because Martin Scorssese directs a movie, doesn't make it "great". He's had plenty of lousy directing jobs. But the Hollywood "elite" jump right on the bandwagon to justify anything that Spielberg, Scorsesse, Abrams, etc. do even when they suck. I went for the "godly" reviews but ended up disappointed.I saw Hugo 3D tonight and found it extremely slow and boring. After 30 minutes the lady next to me kept asking, is it going to get better. I could only nod in agreement. Being that this is tauted as Scorsesse's first family film, I doubt many families would be able to sit through this too lengthy debacle of boredom. At a price tag of about $170,000,000, your grandfather could have been given 2 months of directing lessons and made just as good a movie at half the cost. They spared no expense in making this movie and probably as much in the "hype-up" money spent on marketing.Better yet, Paramount should have saved 3/4 of the money and had Marty direct a real "family" movie. With a few of Marty's super duper camera angles, throw in 3D, some subdued lighting and dialogueless scenes and it would become a "Masterpiece".To show how brain dead the media gets with "A" list Directors, Producers and Actors....It surprises me that no one in the media made a single comment about the fact that here are all the main characters born and living in Paris, France, but none of them speak French, nor English with a French Dialect. Instead, they all speak "Bristish English". In Harry Potter it was understandable. Even the inspector who watches over the Train Station. How "unbelievable" can you get. Even Danny Kaye could do a movie in English with a Frech accent and maintain the image. In Hugo, the reality of being in Paris went right down thru the tubes. I guess the Hollywood Elite can do no wrong. I am not surprised that non of the media reviewers commented on the fact that the movie was very different from the book. If it was someone else, they would have lambasted for that departure. Nothing can justify the blatant dis-honest and subjective accolades given to this film without mentioning it's so many faults. Reviewers are calling it a "Masterpiece". "3D brought to a new level - beyond James Cameron's Avatar" What kind of falsified "BS" is that.Lawrence of Arabia is a "Masterpiece", Gone with the wind is a Masterpiece. Doctor Zivago, Ben Her, etc, etc. are all considered "Masterpieces". But Hugo? Not in the same class at all. For the price tag - Is the Cinematography pretty....yes. Are the sets beautiful....yes. Does it have a rather dismal feel to the movie....yes. Is the acting exceptional....NO! Ben Kingsly is good in anything he does, he is a seasoned actor and he was very watchable in this movie although somewhat despicable in the beginning. Jude Law had a "blink" and you missed him cameo appearance...so nothing great there. And the 2 kids, well Asa Butterball was marginally interesting. Any good Hollywood actor of 13 or 14 would have done a great job in this movie. There were so many boring moments in the movie where Scorcesse has you look at him for what feels like hours without dialog.I didn't feel any kinship with the kids characters, no energy or life in the portrayal by Asa Butterfield. I didn't even feel any sense of "pain" from all his loses and how he lives. Somehow Hugo's pain was less important than Ben Kingsley's. More of a coached neutral acting job and with a British Accent no less. Chloe Moretz must have been picked for her french last name, but she didn't speak french or have a french accent either. Her performance was usable, but nothing dynamic. In so many places the film needed more passion and energy, and a nudge over the top, but most were given only as a flat performance. Not sure what the had in mind with these 2 picks, other than not to have them overshadow the "A" lister actors. Very Disappointing performances in a story that called for much more passion and emotion. I saw the reviews on Sacha Baron Cohen....o.k.what was the big deal? He was o.k. at best, nothing exceptional. Just because he didn't do "Bruno's" characterization, doesn't mean he is suddenly the greatest thing since chicken soup.Hugo is very long and draggy and ends on some Scorcesseish need to expose some "Cinema Verte" Hollywood cliché'experience to sucker in the "drone" reviewers of Hollywood. Or maybe they were all drugged before they saw the movie or paid off. Personally, I like to think for myself. The marketing of this film was also played out with all kinds of games going on. Initial limited distribution, blitzing articles, ads, exposure bought just about everywhere. They must have spent as much on marketing as the film cost. can't go anywhere and not see something about Hugo. I don't agree with buying audiences.I never fall asleep in a movie so this is my first. I fell asleep 3/4 of the way through it, as it dragged on. Who was this movie was intended for. Was it made to show in a film class about what you can do with a big budget? Was it meant for adults who find long boring dialog in movies interesting, or is it simply an attempt for the director to jumble into a film a whole bunch of stuff and cram out a warm/fuzzy "Cinema Verte-Esq" Genre-ee" from the old days, so that the director could pay homage to something and older people would remember the silent films of yesterday... To borrow a phrase from the Tom Hanks movie "Big"....I don't get it!

I don't think Martin Scorsese really cares if Hugo does well with audiences and at the box office. I think he's pleased with the end product and has successfully made an ode to cinema. Here's a man who has made one amazing film after another, and now he wants to pay tribute to a form of entertainment through the same form of entertainment. To put it simply; Hugo is a movie that loves movies.I did in fact read the novel, The Many Inventions of Hugo Cabret, by Brian Selznick which is why I was so worried about a film adaptation of the book. I knew it was coming, but how would they erect a film that is made up of mostly stunning pencil illustrations. Thankfully, the film fell into the hands of a director who knows the game of cinema inside and out and because of that he gives Hugo the stunning treatment it deserves. During the course of the film, we begin to see that this is clearly Scorsese's most personal film. Growing up in Little Italy, he was sheltered in his house because of his asthma. His mother would take him to the local movie theater, which lead to Scorsese's increasing fondness for cinema early on and eventually he made movies of all sorts.Hugo is a landmark for Scorsese for three reasons; the personal qualities, the 3D, and the target audience. This is Scorsese's first family film, and he shows that just like his traditional films, Hugo will appeal to some people, but not all. Reception will be divided amongst youngsters, but parents will be astounded when they see the milestone the film achieves.Set in 1930's Paris, Hugo (Butterfield) is a young boy who literally lives in the clocks of a hectic train station. On the ground floor are a number of regular people with hefty baggage. Emily Mortimer is the flower girl, Christopher Lee is the bookshop owner, and Frances de la Tour as Madame Emile is the cafe owner. Hugo's father died recently, and since then, his uncle has taken him to live at the train station.Hugo's uncle teaches him to take care of the clocks all around the station, winding them up, and keeping them in great shape before he disappears. Hugo must now stay out of trouble, and out of Inspector Gustav (Baron Cohen), the station manager's sight.Meanwhile, since Hugo's father died he has been trying to repair an old automaton which he believes has a message from his father. An automaton is a crafty machine, built to resemble a human being, that is programmed to write down a message if all the parts are in place. Hugo has stolen parts from a toy store in order to rebuild the automaton, but is caught one day by the owner Papa Georges (played exquisitely by Ben Kingsley) who burns his notebook containing instructions on rebuilding the figure. Hugo teams up with Georges' goddaughter Isabelle (Moretz) and the two go through an adventure trying to repair the figure, while Hugo shows Isabelle the beauty of cinema.That is another place where Scorsese's love for film comes into play and further cements the personal element of the film. Hugo shows Isabelle why cinema is so spellbinding and teaches her to appreciate it, like Scorsese has taught us with many of his films.This is a visually intelligent piece, and is one of cinema's greatest achievements of, not only the year, but of the new decade. The plot won't concern people who come for the brilliant visuals and the intelligent filmmaking. I will also go as far as to call this the best 3D film I have yet to see. Scorsese doesn't incorporate the medium as a gimmick, but as an enhancement to the world we are submersed in for two hours. Hugo is lit beautifully and astonishingly by glasses that usually drone out vibrant colors.Another thing to note is the professional camera-work, with Scorsese that shouldn't be a surprise, but it let it be said that when we talk about motions and camera-movement that Hugo handles it in such a way that needs to be seen to be believed. The opening shot glides us along the train station floor where we soon arc upwards, in a smooth as silk manner, to the big clock that occupies Hugo behind it. A similar shot can also be seen in the restaurant scene in Goodfellas.Performance-wise, again, the film scores big. We have a cast of elders, youngsters, and people of middle age. Everyone gives a performance worthy of recognition, especially young Asa Butterfield who looks like a miniature movie star.There are many shots of silent films, including a history lesson in very early filmmaking dating back to the early 1890's. This is where Hugo shines; resurrecting the past to give us, not just a rehash, but an unobtrusive look at the art form we're so well acquainted with in modern day society.Scorsese has yet made another masterpiece, without any conceivable flaws in sight. The camera-work is smooth, the visuals are intelligent, the dialog perfectly executed, the performances beautiful, and the 3D amazing. Hugo is a landmark for every field it sinks it steps on.Starring: Asa Butterfield, Chloë Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, and Jude Law. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.

It's that time of year, where all I do is put the Christmas records on repeat and watch any and all releases of Christmas themed movies (if the trailer has red, snow and Santa, I'll watch it). That entitles movies that have tragic beginnings, heartfelt moments, comedy and falling snow in some past century location. Hugo by Martin Scorsese embodies all of those aspects and more, much "3D" more. The setting was dazzling and story line incredible. I saw this movie with my friend and we both had a preconceived notion that anything in 3D was going to be horrible, especially when you wear glasses it's a pain to wear another pair on top, but Scorsese made the film so much worthwhile and the 3D was used incredibly. I felt as if I were one of the passengers walking in the Paris train station and if I reached my hand out I could touch the croissants in the corner and talk to Asa Butterfield who plays Hugo. I was less impressed by his acting but the one who stole the show was definitely Chloe Moretz, she plays with the British accent perfectly. Butterfield as Hugo was alright but I didn't really feel his pain or excitement in some scenes, it was quite bland. Moretz was just amazing to watch, I was a huge fan of her in Kick-ass so when I saw her in this movie I was so excited to see such a huge transformation. Scorsese made a great choice in casting her as the female lead. Overall, Hugo is a fun felt movie for the whole family and the set design and effects were a joy to watch in 3D. This is Scorsese's first 3D movie and already it's the best film of the season. Happy Holidays IMDb!

Hype surrounding a movie is not always a recipe for success – there are the rare exceptions – but, unfortunately, Hugo is not one of them.However, this will not affect box office figures as the big names attached, such as its director, and cast, but I can't see it having any lasting effect on audiences. Mix together the elements of Harry Potter, The Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings, Moulin Rouge – without the magic – and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, et voila, you get Hugo. And that is the problem in a nutshell – it has all the money and colour that Hollywood can buy, but it does not have its own unique identity due to a weak storyline. It is the sad tale of a young boy (Butterfield) who's left all alone in the world when his clock-fixing father (Law) dies, but not before he has learned a few skills of his own. His alcoholic uncle (Winstone) arrives on the scene and leaves Hugo with little choice for his future – either he starves or does his uncle's job, maintaining the clock tower at Paris railway station. The only thing Hugo takes with him from home is a robot that his father rescued from a museum, and was in the process of fixing its intricate mechanics when he met his demise. The notebook where he kept his drawings and ideas about the robot falls into the hands of French film pioneer, Georges Méliès (Kingsley). Until he can get it back, Hugo is determined to finish the job, believing his father will send a sign through it, and he almost does complete the task but a heart shaped key needed to turn the robot on eludes him. Hugo follows Méliès home and befriends his godchild (Moretz), who helps Hugo on his way to a happy ending. On the outside, this has the potential to be a great movie, with the high-profile director at the helm, the scenes of Paris of the early 20th century are magnificent, and the cast could not have be bettered – notably, Butterfield (The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas) is excellent in the title role, and station inspector (Baron Cohen) brings some humour to an otherwise sad story – but there is little substance to it. There were a few subplots, including those involving Christopher Lee (Lord of The Rings) and Frances De La Tour (Rising Damp), which were not explored enough. In fact, the characters added little or no value to the story, and should have been cut out. I could try to explain away my disappointment in this movie by being more than two decades older than the target audience, but that unfortunately still makes it mediocre.Incidentally, look out for a cameo appearance by Scorsese photographing a young Ben Kingsley mid-way through the film.

Let me divide my comments into two sections - Content and Execution - and start with the latter.This is one of the most superbly executed films I have ever seen. Production design is amazing - it evokes its own self-contained universe of time and space unlike any other film I have seen. Scorsese's Gangs Of New York did a similar thing, but Hugo has an air of otherworldliness all of its own. Scorsese's use of the camera is stunning, and his use of 3D is even better - here is the only director other than Cameron (so far) who understands that 3D can be both a tool for storytelling and also an artistic addition to the director's toolbox. The 3D work here truly adds a dimension to what is on screen. It goes without saying that performances are excellent, but the two youngsters who carry the film are top notch. Scorsese's mastery over what appears on screen is total.Now we come to content, and here is where the film falters. The story of an orphaned boy, surviving in a Paris railway station post WWI by keeping the clocks running (in the face of a hostile security Inspector and also a toy shop proprietor from whom he thieves mechanical parts) so that he can mend an automaton which he hopes will give him a clue about his father, is a promising one. It has the virtue of not heading in any of the anticipated directions. Unfortunately, the direction it does head in - a love letter to the birth of the cinema - doesn't easily sit with the story up to that point. And, while it looks good, it doesn't engage the viewer in the same way - I never really felt there was anything very much at stake.So Hugo is definitely worth seeing - and I recommend seeing it in 3D - but it falls some way short of being the totally satisfying experience it starts out as.

The thing about Hugo, is that you really need to know and appreciate great film in order to understand this movie. Yes, its slow. It's not 2001: a space odyssey slow, but it's probably around Lawrence of Arabia slow. If you don't know what that means then don't go see this movie. The pacing in Hugo is definitely interesting, and I think people that say it's dragging are wrong. Don't go see Hugo if you want to see a summer blockbuster. I went to go see Hugo yesterday with my family ( I'm 14 years old ), and I was the one that had recommend it to them. So we got our 3D glasses which are definitely worth it, you must see it in 3D. However, about an hour into the movie I was thinking how amazing this movie was, but when I looked over at my family they were all sleeping. No wonder they didn't get it. For some reason they didn't understand what was happening even though I found it quite simple. That being said THIS IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE. They will not comprehend any of it. Actually, probably the majority of America will not understand it after watching all those mindless Hollywood Blockbuster's. Although, if you are one of those few people like myself that can sit through Intolerance without getting bored then go see this movie. It is amazing for those that can understand it, and you will love it. I promise.

I was frankly stunned at how BAD this movie is. The 3D is very well done, but like all the clockwork and machines the movie revels in, "Hugo" is technically brilliant, moves like an elegant automaton, and has NO heart or soul. It is dead and hollow within.The "plot" is confusing, the script seems to be more dictated over a cell phone than written, the lead character looks like an animated corpse, and it is DULL, DULL, DULL, DULL, DULL. My boyfriend actually fell asleep. It is terrible that a technique such as 3D seems to have totally eliminated the need for a decent plot, script, characters, motivation and some essence of believability. Scorsese also has to re-learn the use of editing as the movie is too long by at least a half hour, and the pace limps slower than the villainous station cop's leg.The acting was competent except for Sacha Baron Cohen who is nearly unwatchable as the aforementioned gendarme - if he would only get a wooden leg it would match the rest of his performance.The "plot" manipulates emotions rather than inspires them, and is unbelievably pedantic. It's like watching Scorsese lecture a Film 101 class. ***SPOILER?*** I could not believe the scene in the library where the children actually PULL OUT A BOOK and start lecturing the audience about the history of movies up to that point. Stunningly awful.The great irony is that George Melies made FAR FAR FAR greater movies, even with his limited technology than this putrid piece of dreck. "Hugo" is a shameful waste of $170 million dollars. The Melies clips are the ONLY part of this debacle that have life, art, wit, color, and are actually entertaining.PULEEEZZZZZ....Marty....put down the camera for GOOD, and stay in the lecture hall. You have lost the ability to make captivating, interesting movies that speak to normal, living people. If you want to make a movie about Melies, or educate the audience....make a documentary.

At face level, this is the thrilling narrative of (fictional) young, newly orphaned Hugo Cabret's attempt to complete the automaton/robot his recently deceased father was restoring and how that brings Hugo's life and that of (real person) Georges Méliès, the French giant of early movie-making, into more and more conflict--but eventually satisfying contact with each other.'Movies are like dreams that interweave fantasies with realities.'At a deeper level, "Hugo" is Scorsese's homage and paeans to Méliès (actual episodes of many of Méliès' restored films are shown along with Scorsese's view of their making)--AND to ALL of movie-making. (Wikipedia's article on Georges Méliès helps define where Scorsese's version is surprisingly true to life and the few places it isn't; knowing this before seeing the film will increase its enjoyment for most viewers.) 'Movies are like dreams that interweave fantasies with realities.'The more familiarity viewers have with movies across the past 110+ years, the more they'll be gratified by Scorsese's references to their power plus reminiscences of bygone actors and scenes; he interweaves these allusions into the face value narrative. As examples-- --several bits hint at the boy-girl romances in many movies: will this station security master & flower girl get together? --In a similar vignette, the man who gets a dog to win a lady's interest is a lookalike double of S.Z.("Cuddles") Sakall who played many feel-good bit parts in '40s-'50s movies. --One scene has Hugo reprising silent film's Harold Lloyd ("Safety Last") hanging on the hand of a clock far above a city's street. --Etc., etc. 'Movies are like dreams that interweave fantasies with realities.'At its deeper levels, "Hugo" is Scorsese's reminder of how important motion pictures have become in our lives.My rating, 8.5 of 10, may be revised up. :)

I made the mistake of believing the trailers for this movie which made it look like a cross between Harry Potter and the Narnia movies. It's not at all like that. It is a movie for movie buffs to enjoy, who will get all the movie related homages. It's a movie for teenagers definitely, those who have the patience to sit through a "kids" movie this long. I would definitely not recommend it for the average kid under 10 years old - it's not violent or anything like some of Scorcese's other movies, it's just not kid friendly. Take the under 10's to Arthur Christmas and leave this one to the teens and adults - they will most likely find it visually stunning, breathtaking in fact, if a bit lacking in concrete plot - and there are some pretty big holes in this plot too.Quite frankly, as an adult who LOVES movies, I found it to be beautifully crafted, beautifully shot, but I won't watch it again because it was totally lacking in story.Why do we watch a movie again and again? Because we love to relive the story over and over again, even overlooking the parts that were not that great (I'm thinking "It's a Wonderful Life"'s talking angel stars - perhaps good SFX at the time, just annoying now!).Sorry Mr Scorcese - it's beautiful, like a Monet, Picasso etc, but I don't want to own it or re-watch it again.Honestly, I preferred The Polar Express - similar hype, better story, definitely one to own. This one, not so much!

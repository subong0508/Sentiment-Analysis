Overall movie was great Although movie starts a bit slow and i was a little confused and bored but after that the movie finally starts catching up to the expectation.For me this was the best x-men movie because this movie has the best action sequences as compared to any other x-men movie with a great story and emotion(not as good as days of future past but who cares its a superhero movie) .and QUICKSILVER WASSS AWESOMEEEEE .I can literally watch the movie again just because of quicksilver.I never thought they could top the X-Men: Days of Future Past action(or comedy) scene but they did.Acting of all the cast members were awesome and James McAvoy,Michael Fassbender & Jennifer Lawrence knocked it out the park.I don't understand the critics , I never did.(sound's similar to superman's mom in BvS that was in the trailer :P)Movie the great and I can't wait to watch it again.

Okay, this is already the fourth superhero film we have gotten so far this year. The fact that it's this good blows my mind, it's the sixth entry in the main X-Men series, and it might be the third best after X2 and Days of Future Past. Oscar Isaac gives an outstanding performance as the mutant menace: Apocalypse, he was the highlight of the film right next to Fassbender's Magneto (who never fails to deliver). In a year with pathetic and disappointing superhero film villains so far, Apocalypse gives us the layered and threatening performance we want from our villains. Evan Peters returns as Quicksilver once more to give us an amazing scene that tops the one from Days of Future Past. The newcomers are fantastic and exciting and we will certainly see them again in the future. They also finally got Cyclops right! Forget about Rotten Tomatoes and go see this film opening weekend, you won't regret!

I am horrified by the people on the message boards here on this movie's threads. They're fighting each other like a bunch of hungry animals. Since when does everyone started listening to the critics? I mean, yes, to have an idea before watching a movie is good, but that's not the case these days. Critics are taking movies way too seriously these days. It's just a source of entertainment. Your life does not depend on it. Stop bad mouthing this movie for others. Okay, sorry for my rant but this has gotten out of control. Now getting back to the movie, let's just say it delivered what it promised. This movie was amazing. It really felt like you were watching something Apocalyptic. Although I don't have had a problem with Bryan Singer's X Men movies, unlike a bunch of whiny babies, this one actually felt like it was an X Men movie. A sheer resemblance of what we saw in X Men cartoons, both evolution and the 1990 ones. We actually saw the main characters of this movie in their mutant form. I have loved how Bryan always preferred acting over action in his other movies, but this one, it consists of both. I have also seen critics saying that this movie is complete CGI. Well it's not like you can do actual Apocalyptic level scenes without having any CGI effects. That's just crazy. And the CGI in this movie is beyond awesome. I already smell an Oscar for CGI for this movie. Oscar Isaac was so impressive in this movie. Even though he was buried under make up and what not, you could actually feel his performance. Michael and James once again give awesome performances. Expected nothing less from Jennifer Lawrence. At least these movies actually give spotlight to the female actresses *cough* *Marvel* *cough*. The new actors were great. So talented. Tye, Sophie, Alexandra, Kodi and of course Evan Peters were all good in their respective roles. This movie might feel a different because of it's whole world at stake thing. This is the first time X Men has done this, and they succeed really good at it. It had a perfect balance of action, humor, emotion and mutants. It was like watching a live action version of those X Men cartoons we grew up watching. Once again, please dear my friends, who would love to see these guys in MCU, it's not happening anytime soon. Let's just get over it, okay? The producer of these movies has already announced a bunch of new movies under Fox. There are X Men TV shows coming out soon, so let us enjoy these while you guys enjoy yours okay?

Warning, I will be posting spoilers because I feel I can only review this movie properly by telling talking about everything. So if you don't want spoilers, then please don't read this.Again...don't read this if you don't want spoilers...Firstly, the returning cast of McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence and Hoult are cool. They don't really have in depth character journeys but they do well with what they were given. Magneto's reasoning for joining Apocalypse was a bit ham fisted. Taking him back to Auschwitz as a way to manipulate him into getting on board with a human annihilation plan didn't make much sense. I know Magneto is ruthless but that's a kind of dramatic. I like how Raven is saving mutants but I don't understand why she doesn't want to be the "poster child" for mutants. Her entire arc in First Class was being a "mutant and proud", after being insecure over her appearance and now she can spread that message but chooses not to. It kind of contradicts her character. There isn't much to say about Beast and Charles, they are good but don't really shine in this movie. Although, it was great seeing McAvoy with the iconic bald head.I definitely feel like this movie suffered from having too many characters. Singer just couldn't balance it. I feel like you cant bring iconic character to screen and have them be props, or just there for cool effects and action scene. If you want to do that, its best if you make up characters. My point is Psylocke barely has any lines and just makes the weird face throughout the whole movie. I feel like all her "great" moments are in the trailers, so she was underwhelming. It definitely shows that she was a last minute edition to the movie because her character is terribly under developed. Angel is another prop, although his final fight scene with Nightcrawler is pretty dope. Jubilee did not need to be in this movie. She didn't even use her powers. Not ONCE. But Cyclops introduction was good and a great nod to comics/cartoons. Jean Grey was cool and Storm was wasted as always. She did have her accent, however she didn't have much to do and in the final battle just stood around.Apocalypse I feel was a wasted villain. Since the comics, he's always had a survival of the fittest mentality but I feel like they needed to elaborate more on his reasoning for wanting to destroy the Earth. And like, what's gonna happen after we destroy the world? Secondly, you can't touch a television in the 1980s and have all of the knowledge of the world for the past 5000 years. Maybe now, with he internet but in the 80s....definitely not, that was stupid. I think this was a wasted villain and the final battle was a bit underwhelming, minus some cool visual moments. I, also, am wondering what would make Mystique think that she could take down Apocalypse? Weird.I know it seems like I'm ragging on the movie, it definitely had some cool, interesting, funny moments but I feel like the cons outweigh the pros. Quicksilver's scene definitely tops the one from DOFP. But I thought it was so convenient for him to arrive at the school at the moment Apocalypse was destroying the mansion. Also, why the hell did they kill Havok. After, three movies they just didn't let him be great. Total was of a character.This movie is not a bad movie. Some of the critics are definitely being dramatic, but I feel like this film suffers from trying to top itself and rival other superhero franchises like Superman and Civil War. I'm glad that it contains a lot more action than previous X-Men movies and I'm glad that Fox is trying to embrace the science fiction aspect of these stories, but it just falls short to me. I do have a lot more complaints but I will keep those to myself. Of course, I will never tell anyone to not see a movie. I think you should see for yourself to form your own opinion, this review is just my personal experience in words.Anyone who gives this movie a 1 is just being dramatic and knit picking. But anyone who rates this movie a 10 is just trying to battle the terrible reviewers instead of being realistic and honest. Lastly, I don't want the X-Men to go back to Marvel (as great as that would be), I think the X- Men should stay it's own universe. However, I do think the franchise suffers because of the creatives that handle bringing it to life. Kinberg and Singer should just leave this franchise alone and allow some fresh hands/eyes to take these movies to the next level. Even with DOFP erasing some continuity issues, they just bring more issues into the franchise that make your head twirl.OMG....last thing, i promise. The wolverine sequence was cool and fun to watch. But it just wasn't needed at all. That entire scene should have been the post credits. Speaking of post credits, it's nice to know that Mister Sinister exists in this universe. I guess I'm anxious to see which movie he will be a villain in; Deadpool sequel, New Mutants or the next X-men film.

To tell you upfront, I always loved the X-Men series (just the films, never read the comics). Was also a big fan of Days of Future Past who has the same writer and director. But Apocalypse, what a sad mess. Making all the mistakes I hate about many recent action adventure movies. Compare the scene of Eric Lensherr in Auschwitz (X-Men: First Class) with the scene of Eric in Auschwitz in this new entry of the X-Men saga, and you might understand what I mean. When you start destroying cities, or most of the earth, you are drained of any connection. Bad guy Apocalypse is so powerful, you wonder all the way why does he need Charles to succeed with his evil plan. Too many characters not interacting until the end of the movie, with odd pacing and scenes obviously not cut in the order of the screenplay even the makers seem to have lost the overview of all the story lines. Also it gets harder and harder to connect the Prequels with the first Trilogy, even though Days of Future Past changed everything anyhow, especially The Last StandIn the end you must agree with Jean Grey (Sophie Turner is one of the few discoveries for me, since I have never seen Game of Thrones) who claims "At least we can agree the third part is always the worst" leaving a screening of Return of the Jedi. This pun directed at the The Last Stand (and one of the very few gags working, in the first X-Men entry drained of all humor) unfortunately also holds true for X-Men: Apocalypse, the third entry of the First Class trilogy.

For once I agree with the critics, this movie was SO boring and confusing. It has the same old story and it was not exciting at all, civil war was much better and so was batman vs superman. Some things were good but it was filled with many different flaws and some things in the movie did not make any sense. Till now I have been pretty disappointed with superhero movies such as b v s , civil war and now this. Lets hope that suicide squad does any good. This movie was boring , confusing and did not have a different story line like civil war.The effects in the movie were very good and on point but other than that I did not like this movie

The movie gave everything I expected from it, and more.Action? Check.Drama? Check.Funny moments and scenes? HUGE check. (still laughing when replying in my mind! :))Unlike many who watched the pre-premiere, I'm not a groupie of the X-men series, but still enjoyed each and every minute.Reading other reviews, looks like it's a good thing I'm not a groupie, because that means I don't have to stop and think about every action in the movie. I could just sit back, watch with clear mind, and enjoy.All in all, just fun to watch. 140 minutes that end with a desire for 140 more.

Before Apocalypse unleashes the end of the world, there is a moment when the gifted youngsters of Professor Charles Xavier's school for mutants sneak out to the cinema to see 'Return of the Jedi'. Following a debate which of the original 'Star Wars' films is the best, a teenage Jean Grey gets the final word with the following remark: "Well, at least we can all agree, the third one is always the worst". Though clearly intended as a dig at Brett Ratner's oft-criticised 'The Last Stand', it is an equally prescient remark about the third superhero-versus-superhero showdown of this year, a loud, empty, overblown CGI-fest that possesses not the depth or excitement of the eminently superior 'Captain America: Civil War' nor even the grand operatic ambition of the flawed 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'.As promising as it may be to underscore the ideological divide among the mutants of waging war or making peace by introducing an all- powerful deity meant to be the first of their kind, that premise never quite comes to fruition here. Aside from world domination (which pretty much sums up describes what every other comic book villain is after), there is no purpose or motivation to Apocalypse's plan to scorch everything on the planet. Try though Oscar Isaac does, the usually charismatic actor struggles to bring much conviction to his character's monologues about restoring the strong in their rightful place atop society, not least because the actor is buried under slathered-on makeup, facial prosthetics and a costume that would make Thanos embarrassed.Seeing as how Apocalypse proves to be a disappointingly generic villain, it once again falls to James McAvoy's Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender's Magneto/ Erik Lensherr to provide the dramatic conflict on which the showdown between good and evil is based. And yet that tension between Charles' man of reason and hope versus Magneto's darker impulses has been fought so many times that it feels familiar and undercooked here, especially considering how its immediate predecessor had fleshed out the same complex relationship out so much more beautifully.That essentially reduces 'Apocalypse' to yet another superhero round- up much like the first 'X-Men' or 'X-Men: First Class', and so, for the first hour, we are introduced to newcomers Tye Sheridan's laser- sighted Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops, Sophie Turner's telekinetic Jean Grey and Teutonic teleporter Kurt Wagner a.k.a. Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). They will eventually join forces with 'First Class' regulars Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Hank McCoy a.k.a. Beast (Nicholas Hoult) to go head to head with Apocalypse's 'Four Horsemen' recruits – weather-controller Storm (Alexandra Shipp), energy- manipulator Psylocke (Olivia Munn), flight-enabled Angel (Ben Hardy) and last but not least, Magneto. News about the latter will also prompt the son he doesn't yet know about, Quiksilver (Evan Peters), to enlist in Professor Xavier's school, where he will put his fleet- footed powers to save all the students within from an explosion ripping the building apart.Given how that sequence set to Eurythmics' period-appropriate synth- jam 'Sweet Dreams' is by and large an exact copy of the crowdpleasing scene-stealing sequence in 'Days of Future Past', there is more than a nagging suspicion that director Bryan Singer (who marks his fourth 'X- Men' outing with this movie) has pretty much run out of ideas. As if compensating for an attention-deficit audience, Singer and his screenwriter Simon Kinberg cut from subplot to subplot without ever letting their audience get involved in any one storyline or character. Even though the 'X-Men' movies have always been an ensemble, Singer has always grounded them in their struggles to emerge from wealth or poverty, acceptance or rejection, confidence or self-hatred; yet this latest dumbs down their humanity in favour of pure spectacle, which proves an ultimately foolhardy choice in this era where there are just too many superheroes fighting for our attention.Even as a superhero slugfest, the action is frankly disappointing. It says a lot when Quiksilver's cheeky slo-mo turns out to be the highlight of a film that promises no less than the end of the world. At any and every opportunity, every other character reminds us of what is at stake, but the large-scale catastrophe consists of nothing more than unimpressive shots of capital cities (including New York, Sydney and Cairo) reduced to swirling CGI-dust with little sense of tragedy or consequence. The climax itself is packed with plenty of sound and fury, but comes off shockingly dull. Rather than have the Horsemen take apart the good guys as a team, Singer splits the fight into a series of mini-skirmishes that hardly do the characters or their superpowers justice. By the time Apocalypse (finally) steps into the fray after a way-too-long buildup, the battle has shifted into his mind (which, as we suspect, turns out to be pretty blank), but that change of setting barely unleashes any creative possibility for Singer to think out of this world.And coming off 'Days of Future Past', 'Apocalypse' is undoubtedly a tragic letdown. There are so many characters that even Charles and Magneto become no more than supporting acts, their perennial disagreement treated as an afterthought than the dramatic dynamo of the film. The titular villain may seem like great potential as an antagonist, but ends up vague, underwhelming and insignificant. And most notably, what used to be potent allegory about the civil rights movement or coming out in the LGBT community has now been diminished to standard, sometimes sub-standard, superhero melee, so much so that it even fails to make good use of its vibrant 1980s setting except for a couple of recognisable tunes. It may not be the apocalypse of the 'X-Men' franchise, but this dreadfully boring and derivative entry could very well portent its end.

It was everything I hoped it would be. Awesome action sequences, stunning picture, funny scenes, cool Easter eggs/references. Apocalypse wasn't as bad as I thought he would be. He was actually OK.If you thought they could not top Quicksilver's awesome scene from Days of Future Past, get ready for a treat because his scenes were amazing. Marvel, you should get a few lessons on how to make a proper Quicksilver from Fox. Sophie Turner was really good as Jean and I think we finally have a bad-ass Cyclops. Saw it last night and I will probably go see it a few more times. Lets hope there will be more X-Men movies with this cast.

X-Men: Apocalypse is absolutely amazing! The early reviewers don't seem to understand these characters and they don't understand this film. It sets a new precedent for comic book films in a world over-saturated with adaptations.The film hits every nostalgic and aesthetic beat it's supposed to without devolving into pure fan service. The writing is great. The allegory the mutant plight is for civil rights is given its due screen time. The characterization of the superheroes goes beyond their powers and outfits and at least touches the heart of who they are as people. Its main fault is juggling so many characters and so some of the acting comes off as stilted at times. In a way this is also its strength, because it manages to tell a coherent and compelling narrative with a large ensemble cast of characters, emulating the source material faithfully. It is a comic book fan's film.The action scenes are epic in scope, with stakes so high you'll be on the edge of your seat with you eyes transfixed on the action, yet never does the pacing sacrifice plot or character development for obligatory spectacle. Everything is purposefully sensational.As someone who was born in the 80s and experienced these characters' evolution through popular culture onto the big screen, I can say that X-Men: Apocalypse brings the flavor of the comics and the 90s TV show to the big screen in a way that children of the 80s and 90s love.

I went to see this movie in London for the screening event and it was awesome. Got to see the actors and it was spectacular! I loved it and this is perhaps the most X-Men movie ever (spoiler: we finally get to see Jean tapping into the Phoenix Force!!! And we also get to see some colorful costumes in the end) the reviews are mixed but watch this movie and enjoy the ride!) The actors brought their a-game although Olivia Munn and Ben hardy aren't given much. However their action sequences makes it up for what they lack when it comes down to dialogue. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are fantastic as always. Oscar Isaac and Jennifer Lawrence are somewhat okay but not wasted! The new kids on the X-Mansion are great and hopefully the next movie will explore their personalities. Each kid shines on their own and fans won't be disappointed. 10/10

It's hard to fault anyone for approaching X-Men: Apocalypse with optimism. 20th Century Fox has consistently failed the Fantastic Four, but they've had a better track record in recent years with Marvel's mutants. We've been #blessed with Bryan Singer's Days Of Future Past, a brainy, bold thrill ride that uses its myriad characters to excellent effect in telling a time-twisted tale of doom and well, apocalypse. Tim Miller's snarky, wacky Deadpool proved without a doubt that the studio is willing to take a risk on a cult property and let it explode all over the silver screen, rather than neuter it out of hand. With Singer back on board and a top-notch cast, hopes are understandably high for the cataclysmic confrontation suggested by the title of this latest entry in the X- Men franchise.We're even promised the holy grail of X-Men villains: ancient mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac, buried under too many layers of make-up and prosthetics). This righteous blue-hued dude, with his huge but poorly defined power-set, is an iconic antagonist for our band of superheroes in the comics: he's been known to lay waste to Earth in the past, present and future. In Singer's incarnation, Apocalypse's four Horsemen include wing-tipped Angel (Ben Hardy); weather witch Storm (Alexandra Shipp); energy-blade-wielding Psylocke (Olivia Munn); and a bitter, broken Magneto/Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender). It's up to Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and his X-Men – superpowered students that include younger versions of uber-powerful Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) and Cyclops/Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan) – to stop Apocalypse from claiming the entire world for himself. Along the way, shape-shifter Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) must decide just how she can best contribute to the mutant cause in which she so firmly believes. Here's the thing: keep your expectations low – lower – lowest – and X-Men: Apocalypse may just pass muster. This is a cookie-cutter blockbuster, sliced and diced together with more efficiency than heart. It dutifully ticks boxes as it chugs along: Apocalypse recruits his acolytes. Magneto loses his heart and soul (again). Charles and Raven discuss and disagree on tactics. Superheroes face off. It's all strung together with several sequences of world- destroying action, filmed in true Roland Emmerich style. Devotees of both the movies and the comics will find things to enjoy: a twitchy, endearing young Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who looks very much like a demon but is deeply devout; another deeply amusing explosion of special effects as fan favourite Quicksilver (Evan Peters) zips through a hilarious rescue mission; and an already publicised cameo by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) that will drive fans berserk.But think a little harder or poke at its shaky plot, and X-Men Apocalypse falls apart quite readily. The truth is that much of this film is neither inspired nor inspiring. It's okay, for the most part, but it's never great, and barely ever good. Simon Kinberg's script is a limp affair, recycling bits that worked better in other movies in the franchise but breaking very little new ground. The stakes are insanely high, but the threat never feels genuine – a feeling that is only reinforced by the clumsy and anti-climactic way in which the final showdown takes place. Can we say deus ex machina? Yes, we can.The character work that lends so much emotion and power to earlier installments like First Class and Days Of Future Past is missing here too. Too much of the story relies on emotional connections that aren't established too well, and which can only be supplied by the viewers themselves. The film meanders without much purpose through its many relationships, staging a series of first meetings or reunions that basically amount to: Jean and Cyclops meet cute! Charles and Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) meet cute! Raven and Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) meet cute! But very little of it sparks to life, and there's a troubling disregard for female agency, too, that fuels Magneto's entire emotional arc in this film. We're also told why Moira disappeared in between films, but she's not given any time to forgive what she has had to forget. At least Singer's cast does good work with what little they are given. As a re-energised Charles, McAvoy is as appealing and charming as ever. Fassbender remains a gift to the franchise: he imbues Erik with the perfect blend of heartbreak and hatred, which serves as a potent reminder of why he makes a far better antagonist than the automaton-on-evil-autopilot that is Apocalypse. In the context of the film, Lawrence delivers a decent performance. But it's still hard to shake the feeling that she's miscast in the role, with her explosive star power prompting the filmmakers to transform Raven into someone pretty much unrecognisable to comic readers. In just eight years, the genre that was once treated as the difficult bastard stepchild of the movie industry has come fully into its own. It's only May and we've already seen three superhero films hit cinemas – Captain America: Civil War: excellent; Deadpool: awesome; Batman v Superman: awful. This latest installment in the X- Men franchise falls on neither extreme. It displays a couple of flashes of brilliance, but not enough to drag it out from the uncomfortable middle ground of mediocrity it occupies. Here's hoping Singer (if he signs on to direct) and Kinberg find their footing again with the inevitable follow-up to X-Men: Apocalypse – we've already been told that it will be set in the '90s, with a rather obscure end-credits scene teasing just where the franchise will go next.

There is a searing sense of humanity in X-MEN: APOCALYPSE's effort to thrust Magneto (Michael Fassbender), one of its key characters, into its emotional core. This allows a brief, but commanding moment establish a formidable ground to a film that aspires for enormous accomplishments. Yet these very same ambitions also seem to serve as malignant flaws that inevitably drags this Bryan Singer's desirous experiment into its very own apocalypse. While it stands with its impressive visual execution and incredible size— boasting one of the biggest character ensembles in superhero cinema—'Apocalypse' can only carry out ephemeral glories that can never compensate for the film's utter lack of structure. Ambition turns out to be this film's biggest threat.As compelling as descriptions might have made him appear, titular 'Apocalypse' (Oscar Isaac), doesn't seem capable to inspire the terror he seems to claim. For a villainous figure whose omnipotent power is meant to decimate civilizations, his efforts are mostly spent for futile chases that mostly involve expanding his network of mutants. At some point, the film shifts entirely on laying grounds for an apocalyptic battle that the narrative doesn't seem bothered to get to at a tolerable pace. Along the way, it constructs further story lines which it willingly abandons before any palpable resolution arrives. The film struggles to hold all its weight and extensions together, and yet it keeps introducing elements for which it has no evident plans to efficiently utilize. Much of this film turns out only trying to expand size, but at the expense of having a decent structure. Interesting characters get left underdeveloped, their backstories often written without congruence to the central storyline. And as it may insist, Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Professor X (James McAvoy)'s struggle runs on an emotional spine that mainly involves a campaign to retrieve Fassbender's Magneto from Apocalypse's hold. All these actors come out more powerful than their roles dictate them to be, defying the limits of their extremely poorly-written characters with strong performances that are enough to cover up for their characters' lack of development. A short but incredibly singular performance by Fassbender during the film's early minutes may be the spot where the film's sense of humanity is at its peak. Unfortunately, this distinction is relegated below technical pursuits. The ones with smaller roles are seemingly just too small to be served with affecting storyline, an apparent flaw in which Sophie Turner's Jean Grey fell.For all its narrative faults, a hope for some compensations may not at all strike as a bad idea. Singer, here, tries to build an immersive world where action sequences are filled with whizzing lethal beams and energy collisions. The one he creates inspire awe and paves way for breathtaking moments, but this is already as far it can get. 'Apocalypse', in spite of its elaborate designs, doesn't quite get past its mammoth aspirations. It has a lot of stuff going on but the film itself deprives them with space to breathe, and eventually seamlessly integrate with each other in the cosmic expanse that Singer ambitiously tries to construct. So, technical splendor and terrific action setpieces, aside, the only thing that actually makes this film commendable, is the sizable amount of reverence it has paid to the canon, making this Bryan Singer's biggest fan service to date. This movie is tolerable at best.

If you like to mindlessly waste an hour or two of your precious existence, then possibly this cinematic garbage might be for you. However, if you want your cinema to be entertaining, then stay well away. This movie could (and should) have had at least 30 minutes cut from the running time. The pacing is so slow and not helped by the overuse of set CGI pieces that somehow were not thrilling at all. There was better stuff in The Mummy.This is lazy film making. And the response from the audience I was part of? A considerable amount of audible yawning.One of the worst films I've seen this year. Let's hope the plug is pulled on this franchise. It's overstayed its welcome.

X-Men Apocalypse may feel like a step down from the good Days of Future Past and the great First Class, but it's tough to hold that against considering just how good those were.Fassbender's Magneto continues to be the best thing about these movies, along with his relationship with Charles Xavier. The rest of the cast is good, and Isaac does a good job of making Apocalypse seem threatening in spite of the character design. Quicksilver steals the show (again) and a certain scene will be sure to satisfy the comic readers, although it's a shame Fox didn't keep it under wraps.The climactic battle is less Roland Emmerich-ish than the trailers suggest (thank God) and the action overall is top notch.However, three of the four horsemen are criminally under developed, and their motivations for joining Apocalypse are never explained. Possibly worse than that is the fact that Apocalypse never explains why he needs them. Moira is in this movie for no reason (although her presence does lead to some hilarious moments with Charles) and could have been cut out completely.Overall this probably won't please anyone who didn't like the previous installments, but is a far cry from the likes of The Last Stand and Origins Wolverine. It joins the first X-Men and the 2013 Wolverine in the pretty good-but-not-great category.

A week before I saw the movie, I had read all the reviews coming about it. Mostly negatives. And, as the release date approach I kinda had doubts about this last installment. But I went ahead, because I love the casts and Bryan Singer. To my surprise, after I had watched it, my mind were still in awe from the movies. It's not as bad as the critics said. Sure, I am agree with those reviews regarding Apocalypse. But it is so forgivable because the X-men do a heck of a job getting rid of him. As for the fact that there are a lots of characters in there that made them seem a bit underdeveloped because lack of backgrounds,well you gotta admit that this is a 144 minutes movie, which could barely explains all those stories. I left the movie Theatre feeling heartbroken by some of the things that happened in the movie. Hats off to sophie Turner. She did a great job! Well if you love X-men franchise, you'll love this one.

Since the Marvel Cinematic Universe came into being in 2008, the superhero genre has undergone an incredible revolution. Nowadays, we're getting numerous top-quality comic book movies year on year, so when one that doesn't quite match that comes along, it feels immensely disappointing, which is unfortunately the case with X-Men: Apocalypse.Before I get into why, however, I want to say that this isn't a terrible film. It's still got some great moments, the introduction of characters like Jean Grey, Nightcrawler and Cyclops is great to see, and, had it been released twenty years ago, it wouldn't seem so poor.However, modern superhero movies are so much more than just bad guys and good guys, and you need far more depth in a story to make an entertaining film. X-Men: Apocalypse, however, delivers a clunky, convoluted plot almost completely devoid of emotional depth, good characterisation or comic relief, and at nearly two and a half hours long, it's a real slog to get through.My biggest issue with the film comes in the form of its narrative. Although it does improve by the end of the film, the first hour and twenty minutes are very poor. Spanning between Apocalypse's creation millennia ago and the 1983, where the main story takes place, the film spends far too long flying to and fro around the world establishing various different characters' back stories, and it turns the film into a mess.Yes, the plot eventually centres its focus in the final act as it heads towards the inevitable final battle, but for a good half of the whole movie, it's very difficult to get grounded on what's going on in the greater scheme of things, which is surprising considering how well Singer's Days Of Future Past managed to handle its even more complex plot.Another problem with the film is that it feels very lifeless. One of the reasons that First Class remains my favourite X-Men film is because it had a sense of fun to it as well as being an impressive action spectacle. Apocalypse does have its obligatory Quicksilver scene (which is brilliant), but apart from that, there's very little sense of fun here, making it almost as brooding a film as Zack Snyder's DC movies, which was not great to see.But sometimes, with a degree of emotional depth and intrigue, a superhero film can still pull off a dark atmosphere. Again, however, Apocalypse fails to deliver. Throughout the whole film, there's only one scene early on with a proper emotional power, which makes the rest of the movie feel very stagnant, so I just wasn't able to get excited and wrapped up in the story.In the end, X-Men: Apocalypse is a big disappointment. Being a big, action-packed blockbuster that lacks any real intelligence or depth, it feels like it was made for release in 2003, but given the high quality that so many expect from superhero films nowadays, a film that comes across as a very stale, lifeless spectacle just doesn't impress.

Now although over on Rotten Tomatoes this movie is getting a lot of flak I would like to say this. F*&k rotten tomatoes! I've seen people claim that it pushes too much into the movie, and even tho there is a lot going on it's done in a coherent way that makes sense.The movie in terms of scale is incredible. You really get the feeling that these mutants are essentially gods. It has a huge emotional heart to it with serious tear jearkers at some points, yet also manages to squeeze in great humor and subtle references to fans of the comics. (I won't reveal what they are but it's pretty big) All I can say is that in terms of emotion, action, scale, and tension this movie is by far the best in the franchise. I mean they are facing essentially a god and it's hard to comprehend how they will ever manage to defeat him. Just go out and watch it it's deferentially worth the price of admission.

Was hooked from the start, the show of powers in this movie was spot on. The action sequences where awesome was really happy with how it was all done. Quicksliver brought fun to the movie and some pretty bad ass scenes. Sophie Turner was the Jean Grey I've been waiting for since the first X- Men movie. All of the cast did great in there roles i have no complaints apart from i would have liked a little bit more of Psylocke.This is a movie that i will be re-watching a few times, i am all ready hyped for the next instalment of this franchise. Hats of to you Fox, You actually made a superhero movie i can watch over and over again besides Deadpool Bravo.

As the title say, this movie is Apocalyptic. The destructive is great, and it's awesome. My expectation for this movie was quiet high and this movie has done it very well, even though Days of Future Past felt slightly better. Actually I'm a bit surprised when people get confused with the story at the beginning. When you already saw the other X-men movies, the story won't be that hard to understand. The beginning was to introduced the villains and re-introduced some mutants from the first trilogy, and then the conflict started to rise. The best part came when Quicksilver did his scene, just like he did in the Days of Future Past, but this time he got more part.But there's also some shortage, like the conflicts and the problem solving are quiet simple, and there's some CGI that looks cheap.Overall, this movie is worth to watch. Forget about those critics for being too serious because it's very enjoyable and entertaining, and that's the movies are for.

X-Men Apocalypse is another fine chapter in a franchise that director Bryan Singer brilliantly setup in 2000, and returned with the excellent Days of Future Past in 2014. Yes, it may be a CGI heavy action-adventure but it's bold, effortlessly mixing action, characterisation, social commentary and mythology that we have come to expect from this saga.With the emergence of the world's first mutant, Apocalypse, the X-Men must unite to defeat his extinction level plan. Set in the 1980s – several years after the events in Days Of Future Past that revealed the existence of mutants to the world – we find Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) continuing with his School For Gifted Youngsters, as he welcomes new students (Sophie Turner's Jean Grey, Tye Sheridan's Cyclops, and Kodi Smit-McPhee's Nightcrawler) who are coming to terms with their powers. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is still conflicted as she seeks out other mutants, while Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is hiding in Poland with his wife and child. Soon, however, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) wakes from a centuries-long sleep to find weak, blind leaders ruling the world. He gathers together Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Archangel (Ben Hardy) and Magneto, using their fear and anger to convince them that humanity's time is up.With so much going on, it's incredible how Singer's cast of young and old fit so well together. Several of the returning characters are given time for emotional scenes, while new mutants are given room to breathe as the young, vulnerable yet heroic students. On top of the characters already mentioned we have Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy/Beast; Evan Peters as Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver; Lana Condor as Jubilee, Lucas Till as Alex Summers/Havoc, Josh Helman as William Stryker; Rose Byrne as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert and last but not least, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine gives a show stealing scene to remember. All the cast deliver performances ranging from good to great. Michael Fassbender once again portrays his intense inner struggle perfectly. Jennifer Lawrence, on the other hand, looks and sounds like she'd rather be elsewhere.For the most part, the movie isn't afraid to take it's time, setting up the young heroes and catching up with the old guard. With a runtime of 2 hours and 24 minutes, i certainly felt the pace drag at times. It's kind of expected since the X-Men movies are known to be more talky and intellectual than others. Overall the tone is dark, dealing with heavy themes of loss and inner conflict. And yet, unfortunately, there is goofy comic relief crammed in for those who fall asleep too easily. Although in the third act the CGI felt overblown, the action scenes are stunning visual eye candy. Nightcrawler vs Archangel, Cyclops vs Storm, and Beast vs Psylocke are jaw droppingly good. No shaky-cam or over editing here, just intelligent, well framed direction that's easy to follow without trying too hard.X-Men: Apocalypse feels like an end and a beginning. It ties up what's came before with what's ahead. Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughan continue to inject fresh ideas with familiar elements, building an unpredictable universe with deep stories, creative visuals and fantastical characters.

This film is absolutely superb , it has action, great affects and emotional in some scenes, all i can say is go and watch this it really is amazing for those comic die hard fans. Only criticism i have is i expected a little more form the four horsemen but that isn't enough to slate this film like the critics have. Once more all the actors are superb especially Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse who is very menacing and sinister. Tye Sheridan is a fantastic Scott Summers, as for Sophie Turner well she is superb as Jean Grey perfection. If you love your comics you will love this film, to compare to last stand is well over the top I'm not sure what these critics want or expect.

All of the best and worst of this film is captured in a single extended tangent. Following a dastardly assault by En Sabah Nur, our protagonists are kidnapped and taken to a remote mountain fortress. The kidnapping and subsequent breakout has no impact on the main story aside from slowing it down and drawing it out, and also allows for a cameo that even the most casual of fans will see coming a mile away. The scene is a narrative dead end that no one ever talks about ever again, robbing it of any possible value — but it does get a small rise out of the audience.Really, what's most disappointing is how familiar this end of the world feels. Magneto floats with his arms out. People put fingers to temples. Nothing new to see here. Nothing more to say.

I chose to edit my review done a few years ago. The movie on a first viewing is impressive, looks stunning, sounds exciting and keeps you entertained.Unfortunately, despite the charisma of the cast, the plot fails to make a convincing impression. And the lack of compelling features about Apocalypse due to his shallow intent makes the whole arc messy and uncaptivating.Don't get me wrong. The movie is a fun watch and a guaranteed dose of adrenaline but take that away and you just have the same conflictual Magneto-Charles relationship with either one crying several times, you still have Mystique being on the run, you have Hank unable to do anything as usual, etc. The characters are simply shallow.The new batch of characters is interesting and fun too but they are rushed and we have the same problem that happens with most modern sequels especially star wars; bunch of people hardly introduced and thus highly unlikable. Especially on the antagonists' side.To sum up I'd say that the movie is captivating to watch but does not leave a lasting impact on you. Past the first viewing its flaws are too conspicuous: lack of character substance, and thin plot.

This is my first review here, long time user of the IMDb and I found it about time that I contributed something. I just got home after watching this, what i think, awesome movie. The effects was awesome, the acting tremendous, the 3D was good and the feeling it's left me with is intoxicating. Right from the start, one of the best openings ever, the movie gets me going and maybe it slowed down a bit but i didn't notice because i was to excited and intrigued. This might be the greatest x-men yet, at least now I think that it is. I found my self wanting more after the film had ended even though i had been seeing submarines and deep sea creatures for that last 30 minutes due to a full bladder.I think I'm gonna go and see it again before i can buy it for the collection.That all.

As you can probably gather I thought this was another very good addition to the X-Men franchise. Whilst it doesn't hit the heady heights of Days of Future Past it still is a really good watch and I fail to see why it has had a mixed press.Firstly I found it to have a perfectly serviceable story, with Apocalypse and his followers recruiting the very vulnerable and angry Magneto as part of his plan to destroy civilisation and rebuild it in his image. Fassbender turns in another solid performance and you really feel his pain and confusion for the Erik/Magneto character. I also thought all the supporting cast were absolutely fine in their roles, and to me Evan Peters as Quicksilver really stole the scenes he was in and makes a fine addition to the cast. The same also goes to Tye Sheridan as Scott/Cyclops, whose back story is filled in better and with more depth than it was in the Wolverine origins film.I see the critics have been moaning about having too many characters in the film, yet I actually think it was handled better than it was in the Captain America: Civil War film. In Apocalypse the large cast do actually have something to do and contribute to the story, whereas the Captain America film felt like some were shoe horned in, which I felt made that film feel bloated and repetitive whereas this one at least get the storyline moving. I felt that Civil War felt way too long because of all the story padding yet Apocalypse, whilst also a long film, kept my interest to the end (and yes there is a post credits scene that I suspect is setting up Wolverine 3). I should also add that Apocalypse, despite it's bleak story, does have some moments of humour and wit that went down well with the audience.I also felt the surprise appearance of Wolverine fitted in nicely with the back story that we already know, particularly the one told in X Men 2 and the Origins film, nicely closing that particular characters story arc and fitting in perfectly with the circumstances surrounding his appearance in the very first X-Men film of 16 years ago. If this is to be Wolverines final appearance with the X-men then they have given him a lovely send off.I did find some minor flaws with the film though, particularly with the visual appearance of some of the characters and how their ages don't compute when the first X-men film of 2000 is taken into account. However, asides from that I thoroughly enjoyed X-Men Apocalypse and thought it was a solid & worthy addition to the other X-Men films. The films had spectacle, action, laughs and carried on with the journeys of the characters we have got to know and love over the past sixteen years.

Bryan Singer continues the "X-Men" cinematic lore with a continuation to the "First Class" storyline. We see the team formed then divided in the 60s, clashed in the 70s and regrouped in the 80s. This time, a powerful, ancient mutant named En Sabah Nur or Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) resurfaces and aims to reform a new world but destroying our own. So, it is up to Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and his band of mutants to stop Apocalypse and his Four Horsemen from (what else?) taking over the world.Now, I am an avid follower of the "X-Men" lore. Although I have not read the comics, I follow some story lines that shape up the universe. And I praise Bryan Singer for his efforts ever since the first "X-Men" movie until his return from departure for being involved in "X-Men: First Class" to bring the complex superhero team to silver screen form. I tell this as a strong compliment, for Singer made a bold risk with "X-Men: Apocalypse", whether the repercussions are good or bad.To give its credit, Singer, along with collaborator Simon Kinberg, knows the "X-Men" story lines all too well. But fanfare does not weigh as much as narrative. (Still, for comic book fans, watch out for Easter eggs.) Being too familiar of the storyline makes this the most derivative part of the franchise. And it all feels predictably formulaic: mutants are outcasts but they are given a chance when a baddie emerges, and all is well. Despite the amount of great moments, the narrative lacks the heftiness of its predecessors. And it does not help that the jarring editing jumps like a jumping bean, shifting from one lighter tone to a heavier one. When the story fell flat, the same goes for the cast.To be fair, this is an undeniable cast ensemble, mixing the originals, from McAvoy, Lawrence, Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult as Beast and Rose Byrne in a returning role, with the new generation, from Tye Sheridan as Cyclops, Sophie Turner as Jean Grey, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Kurt/Nightcrawler, Alexandra Shipp as Ororo Munroe/Storm and Olivia Munn as Psylocke. Seeing every mutant interact feels like watching the 90s animated series. But even with that, majority of the characters have no arc. The one that has a recognizable one is Erik Lensherr, who goes through the same plot beats but with winning effect. Michael Fassbender really made a compelling performance as a mutant desiring to live normally, only to be brought down by his unwanted powers. The rest are there to drive the plot, sadly. Then we go to the main villain. As Apocalypse, Oscar Isaac makes up the character for its intimidating presence but gives too little of a payoff, making him generic and kind of disappointing.However there are indeed moments, like Evan Peters topping with another Quicksilver's slow-motion scene, Smit-McPhee's Nightcrawler being an effective comic relief and the final battle in Egypt. But it cannot help rescue "X-Men: Apocalypse" from a derivative plot, a clichéd villain, haphazard editing, a confused tone, a mix of professional and amateur special effects, the absence of deeper themes and missed opportunities with the cast. Still, "X-Men: Apocalypse" is a fun ride, thanks to its enthusiastic and well-committed cast, thrilling action scenes and wonderful moments. It may be a fallout from "X-Men: Days of Future Past", but this Bryan Singer's boldest move for the franchise, better or worse.

I went into this film expecting the worst after reading all of the negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not the best superhero film, nor is it the best Xmen film, but it's solid. Positives: More Quicksilver (not enough though) has a glorious scene that is better than his first Cyclops, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler are great Oscar Isaac as apocalypse is solid Well written motives for every characters actions (unlike BvS) Negatives: More Quicksilver (we want MORE!) or this Quicksilver in the MCU Mystique is terrible - so boring, so useless, offers nothing but talk Magneto flips sides every film, it's played out and predictable. Prof X looked weaker than ever That cameo was poor (also why show it in the trailer) The film felt rushed - Apocalypse assembles his four horsemen almost immediately, basically whichever mutant he sets his eyes on first gets the nod. This could/should have been set up over a couple of movies like Thanos in the MCU. In the end he just looked weak, despite great acting from Oscar Isaac. Good film, go see it but don't expect Iron Man 1, Winter Soldier, Dark Knight Trilogy or Civil War standards?

Oh my En Sabah Nur! I had little expectation for this final X-Men film, yet it still managed to unfortunately disappoint. Having so much to offer, the film appears to have lost it's way and results in an unbalanced mess of plot holes and poor character development. It's difficult to not compare this to the recent release of Civil War but even if Captain American and Co. didn't come about, this is still a stand alone shame and misuse of some of Marvel's greatest characters. Jean Grey pretty much sums up the entire movie whilst discussing Star Wars (what is it with Marvel referencing Star Wars films all of a sudden?) Return of The Jedi confirming "the third one is always the worse." (For the record, RTJ is my personal fave of those three) Is this a reference to the actual movie itself? It's lacked emotion and the action was a poor show. Even with major Hungover Jackman's Wolverine making an unsurprising cameo, the fighting is clumsy, lazy, unimaginative and actually quite boring, which doesn't make sense when trying to showcase and reintroduce some X-Men characters. The CGI is some of the worse I have recently seen and though it's apocalyptic, it's resembles a badly edited version of a Roland Emmerich disaster movie that loses gravity of the situation unfolding. I think the studio spent most of it's budget on Quicksilver's extended time lapse scene maybe trying to recapture the success from 'Days of Future Past' whilst sacrificing the rest of the film's effects. Even the makeup slipped, and though I can appreciate it must be a hard job with characters like Beast and Nightcrawler, I do believe they scripted Raven to always be in disguise so to spare the blue paint for the previously mentioned two. Oscar Isaacs does a superb super villain but I couldn't help but think he would make a better Sith Lord if he wasn't already Poe. He's an egotistical wannabe God who, after a long sleep wakes up in our modern world, checks all our facebook statuses and catches up on Jeremy Kyle via an old TV, who doesn't appear remotely angered or surprised about our fall from greatness, yet decides the world needs culling. I actually understand where he's coming from.Sophie Turner does a good Jean Grey but I found Tye Sheridan's Cyclops annoying. Josh Helman returns as promoted Col. Stryker who actually looks more like Seann Williams Scott and James Marsden love child and Nicholas Hoult as Hank the Beast, a casting I'm still not sure of. I'm also undecided about Kodi Smit-McPhee's Nightcrawler and Rose Bryne's MacTaggert's weird return which felt unnecessary and was just another filler to flesh out the movie; you could do away with her whole part; in fact, I reckon you could cut a third of the movie out without it ruining the storyline. JLaw doesn't actually look like she's bothered in this movie and her character does very little compared to what the trailers suggests, plenty of talking and very little action. (I still love her though.) McAvoy is great as Charles X and Fassbender's Magneto shows some torment but again, he can't seem to make up his mind to who's side he's on. Regardless of his final choice, I don't think it can pardon the largest death toll in all of the Marvel movies. Which, didn't have any emotional impact. Being very mutant concentrated, us meek humans get very little screen time for a world wide genocide, apart from a couple of silly snippets from around the globe, NYC getting torn up and the US superpowers sitting in their swivel chairs looking clichéd and completely stupid. It just felt empty and non-threatening which is really a major fail for an apocalyptic film. The four horsemen get over shadowed by Magneto which isn't a surprise and it just shows how flawed the plot is, elaborating on Magneto's recruitment. They just turned Psylocke, Storm and Angel into wimpy sidekicks and what was the point of Caliban, Jubilee and the Blob making an appearance, apart from filling out an already long enough film.What I did like was the nods to the Marvel and not so Marvel universe like the band Rush and Nightcrawler donning MJ's Thriller jacket. John Ottman's score was good, however the use of Beethoven's symphony No. 7 felt like a cheap copy of it's use in the film 'Knowing' when the world finally comes to a destructive end. There was part of me that wanted Apocalypse to win and lay waste to everyone and get it over with, only to be defeated in an anti-climatic ending, however, Jean Grey's eventual exhibit as Phoenix is pretty epic if not over dramatic. This was definitely a step back for the X-Men franchise and have lost interest. I still think DC's Doomsday would kick everyone's arse.

I trust professional critics in many scenarios. On many occasions, I tend to agree with the critical consensus for the most part. However, sometimes the critical consensus falls into a viewpoint I cannot bring myself to agree with. The film has some serious issues in regards to its pacing and treatment of some of the cast, however, X-Men: Apocalypse has managed to do something no other comic book film to date has ever done to date, to bring the scope of the original comic's mythos successfully to the screen. The films begins in 3600 B.C. as a rebellion in ancient Egypt causes the god-like mutant Apocalypse into a long stasis. In 1983 as Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has taken charge of a new generation of mutants at his school and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) is living a life of peace with a family. However, their idyllic lives are now threatened by the re-emergence of Apocalypse, who recruits four powerful mutants to be his horseman in a mad quest to take over the entire planet. It is up to the X-Men, old and new, to stop him. Apocalypse has been widely criticised as being extremely dull and with a 144-minute runtime, the film definitely takes its sweet time getting to the grand finale. But what it does use that expansive runtime for is key bits of world building, and as a comic-book and literature fan, I'll take good world building over a rushed, propulsive plot any day. Apocalypse has an epic scale, and the massive build up certainly helps to add weight to the explosive climax, but some elements of the film's scale work against it. The cast is huge and many members are either underutilised or under-written to an embarrassing degree. Magneto has a compelling, dramatic story in the film's beginning, but gets little to no resolution when the dust clears. The Four Horsemen are the worst offenders, with Storm, Psylocke and Angel practically having about 5 lines of dialogue between them in the entire film. However, the rest of the film's cast manages to salvage their parts in fantastic fashion. Singer used Days of Future Past to establish the 'First Class Timeline' as standing alongside but separate to the original X-Men film universe and James McAvoy continues to distinguish himself as a different Professor X who's funny and yet heartfelt performance stands alongside Patrick Stewart's iconic portrayal of the character. Newcomers Scott Summers/Cyclops, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler bring a fresh and welcome set of perspectives to the film and it's nice to finally see a Cyclops audiences can truly empathise with on screen. Oscar Isaac does the best he can as the maniacal main villain, Apocalypse, but the character is fairly one-dimensional and audience reactions to him will be hit or miss depending on your preference. A character that has been proved to be consistently excellent and a standout, though, is Evan Peter's Quicksilver, who plays a much larger and more involved role here than his previous outing in Days of Future Past. He has another standout, spectacle scene and probably the best action sequence in the film all to himself. This speedster is right on the money with solid characterisation and a strong performance from Peters. Despite all negatives I could pick up on with the slow-moving plot, some weak sections of the cast and a few other completely forgettable technical nit-picks, Apocalypse certainly knows how to show its audience a good, fan-service filled time. One thing I could never criticise the X-Men franchise of is becoming stale, especially Singer's entries, which is a lot more than I can say for most of Marvel's last few entries in their cinematic universe. With the original film, Singer redefined the superhero genre in cinema, with X-2 he created a multi-layered conflict between multiple factions of humans and mutants and with Days of Future Past he gave audiences a gripping time travel adventure. Apocalypse takes a step even further away from the franchise's 'based in reality' roots but does so with grandeur and confident swagger, while retaining a sense of realistic emotion and genuinely funny humour that never overplay's itself. The film is a behemoth, a comic-book epic of a level of ambition I've never seen successfully put to screen before. The film does something that no other film has ever done: made me feel like I'm watching a comic brought to life from page to screen right before my eyes, and the feeling is absolutely glorious. The action is electrifying, the powers bright and flashy and displayed in their full glory, from Psylocke's energy sword to Cyclops eye beam. This is X-Men for the people who loved the original stories in their Chris Claremont days or grew up watching the 1992 animated series. The soundtrack even gets into the sometimes ridiculous mood of things, jumping from eighties pop to a grand, bombastic score when appropriate. By time the obviously shoehorned in Weapon X appearance comes into play, you're too immersed in the spectacular gravitas of the film to care and you've strapped yourself securely in for a rollicking good time. In the end, X-Men: Apocalypse ends up being one of the most memorable comic-book films to date, perhaps because it is easily the most comic-booky film I've seen yet, in that it showcases this set of compelling super-powered characters in an event of such grand scale, I thought it could only appear on the page. Ignore the critics and make your way down to your local cinema to make up your own mind. Any fan of superheroes, especially of X-Men, will most likely appreciate the ambition on display here, even more so that it works so splendidly. In my opinion, it's far superior to Civil War. In fact, X-Men: Apocalypse may well be my favourite comic-book film since X-2 came out in 2003, and it definitely serves as an appropriate send-off to the 'First Class' as a new generation of X-Men begins.

This movie was excellent! I just came out off the cinema in Amsterdam. The Imax visuals were amazing. Loved every single minute of it and was so sad when it was over.The scenes with magneto were amazingly well done.. the acting made me cry, that's how good they are. Also one of the scenes with Quicksilver.. Damn, I didn't expect it and it was just perfect.There was one downside to this movie and that was that the climax was worse then all the story building towards it. BUT.. nonetheless, the climax was nerve-wrecking.I recommend everybody to watch the other movies before seeing this cause otherwise it won't make much sense.This movie made the story of the old and the new X-men fit so much better. I really hope there is gonna be more x-men in the near future.

Critics didn't get it. I don't know why they're giving so poor reviews. I just watched it and loved it! It's very well-written to give each character good space in the story. They complained about it having too many characters, but that may have been the best part for me! They're all well known characters, so if you watched the other movies, that's not a problem at all. I loved Scott and Jean, and I never liked Halle Berry as Storm, but this new actress is great as Storm! I wanted to see a little more from her and also from the Angel and Psyloche, but other than that, I had plenty of the characters in a good way. I believe this is my favorite X-Men movie so far, and it was the closest to the 90's cartoon I used to love watching, and actually how I got to know them. Two thumbs up!

In X-MEN: APOCALYPSE the stakes are higher, the X-Men are battling against a god-like mutant. X-MEN: APOCALYPSE is an EPIC movie for comic book movie lovers. X-Men Apocalypse had a great balance of drama and action, it was a tearjerker and an adrenaline inducer. For a 2 and a 1/2 hour movie I did not feel the length of this movie, from the beginning till the end i was hooked. It was gorier than the previous X-Men films (excluding Deadpool), especially the intro where you'll go "ooh that was savage" but nonetheless the intro worked for me, it got me hooked and interested on this movie.Critics were harsh on this movie, after I watched the movie I went home and looked at the reviews, and I was shocked that it got this reception. I could not remember myself getting bored on this movie. I had a great expectation for this movie and for me it did not fail to deliver!This movie really showed the "true birth" of the X-Men, it wasn't another Jennifer Lawrence movie, in this movie they really gave each character a spotlight. Olivia Munn, Lana Condor, and Alexandra Shipp were born to be their respective characters. All the actors were on point in this film, especially Fassbender. Every scene Magneto was in really connected to the audience, it was perfect.All characters stood out in this movie, each and every character's abilities were showcased in this film, except Jubilee's which is sad because I was expecting to see Jubilee in action but psshh it's just a minor thing, and at least Jubilee finally had some screen time and dialogue. Kodi Smit-McPhee's performance as Nightcrawler was a killer! This version of Nightcrawler is very close to the one in X- Men: Evolution (Animated Series).The Quicksilver scene was awesome.The cameo of this character that you may (if you watched the trailer) or may not know was fantastic. This "act" had a horror/action feel, it really showed that this character was made to be a killing-thing, and gave hint to this character's intimacy with another character in the future.The climax was very epic that i left the cinema with goosebumps all over me. Whatever you have seen on the trailers, FORGET IT! The trailers were nothing compared to what the movie had shown. IT WAS UNEXPECTED.In my opinion, this is by far the best comic book movie of 2016 and the best X-Men movie ... so far. Kudos to Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg!"ALL IS REVEALED"

If the trailer of this movie made you apprehensive, you had every right to be because the movie is everything the trailer threatened to be- mediocre. Just when we thought that superhero movies were going to new places, we get X-Men: Apocalypse which firmly drags the genre back to mediocrity.Deadpool was wild (and incredibly enjoyable), BvS tried to be different(and failed miserably but still had style which this movie doesn't have) and Civil War was awesome (by being both different and great fun at the same time). But X-Men: Apocalypse doesn't even try to be different. It plods on with a run of the mill story and CGI heavy destruction that interests not one bit (the CGI too is varied. It swings between great to downright crappy). It is overloaded with characters that do not interact and are probably there only for fan-service. So Cyclops's brother dies and it is supposed to jolt you emotionally- only it doesn't. Why would I care about a character that I have hardly seen for 10 minutes in prior X:Men movies and whose interaction with his brother mostly happens off-screen? Simply put, there are a lot of characters but no character development. Olivia Munn as Psylocke is wasted (the lady has so few lines in the movie that at one point you wonder if she is speech impaired). Apocalypse's horsemen are supposed to be super powerful but all they do is act as musclemen and nothing more. Archangel has as much charisma as a mannequin and save for a mild effort at a back story, Storm hasn't much to boast about either. Only Magneto has some semblance of character development but even that feels stale- how many times do we need to see Magneto decide to be the bad guy because his family is killed only to flip sides at the end to join forces with the good guys? This has been happening like forever (since X:2 came out that is). James McAvoy is his usual self as Professor Xavier and the only reason Mystique is so important to the story is because she is played by Jennifer Lawrence (who gives her best phoned-it-in performance). You got to wonder how a shape shifter is such a big deal in a battle among crazy powered freaks (I mean one stroke from Psylocke and she is minced meat) but hey, just because it's Jennifer Lawrence, screw logic. And whats with Apocalypse's make up? The guy looks more like Ivan Ooze from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the character is incredibly one dimensional- just one of your generic bad guys that wants to end the world.Civil War has set the bar high for superhero movies but X-Men: Apocalypse firmly brings it down. The plot is messy and is filled with way too many characters than it can handle. The climatic battle is filled with uninteresting mindless carnage more in the lines of Michael Bay and Ronald Emmerich. The coolest (and the best part) is Quicksilver's super fast evacuation of the X-Mansion. It's really an extension of the scene in DOFP but is longer here and still super cool. We do get a cameo from Wolverine (clearly not in his best shape) but hey, Wolverine is Wolverine right?If you are a casual fan of the X-men (like me), you will find this flick OK-sh (if you are a die hard fan, you will probably love the film and hate me) but as a casual viewer (as most outside the U.S are), you might find it underwhelming- a sense of been there, seen that.Oh and by the way, we do get a post credit scene which serves no purpose at all and is just there because Marvel made it cool to have post-credit scenes. It is just vague and doesn't actually mean anything significant

X-Men: Apocalypse is the proof that the screen adaptation for a story arc from the comics can, indeed, be changed, if that change is for the best.A lot of characters to take in? Certainly, but not to worry: they were somehow able to handle it perfectly. Each character has its own importance and development (ok, not Jubilee, she is barely in the film), and that is one of the keys for a perfect script. Also, it can sometimes be very cruel and down to Earth, which is perfect, considering the giant number of movies/TV shows afraid of killing their important characters, for example. That's why I call this script a fearless one. It's not about the audience, not about what's going to happen in the future. It's about delivering a good story in the present.By the way, Simon Kinberg has, again, done a great job here. Same goes to Bryan Singer. Perfect rhythm, very well thought-out connections, characters' interactions all on point, and that list goes on and on. Surprisingly, it contains all the elements for an awesome superhero movie. Plus, I must say I couldn't be happier with how the whole movie revolves around the true meaning of "family", and the different forms of it.It's a 9/10 because of some repetitions from old movies through the script, mostly with Erik Lehnsherr. It's basically everything we've seen before (twice). His resolutions are so the same I had the feeling even some quotes were identical. That feeling of "oh, I've seen this before somewhere" it's not so good here, unfortunately.Overall, a very nicely done film that you can't miss. DO NOT listen to the critics or that friend who's comparing this to other superhero movies. This is X-Men: Apocalypse and it's everything it intends to be.

X-Men: Apocalypse is a jumbled and sometimes confusing mess of a movie. From the unbalanced CGI, to the one-dimensional title villain and the dreadful, mismatched pacing throughout, this is a car crash that you cant help but to watch. Not because of the gripping story or its characters but because you're waiting for something to happen to make you care about this movie. This film (as well as the previous 2 films) are carried and driven by Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Magneto. You see and feel his pain of wanting to do right and live a normal life but is always thwarted by some circumstance that causes conflict within himself. Oscar Issac's Apocalypse is a character that is limited to one- dimensional views of a world he left behind and has now rejoined. One of the most intelligent and fearsome of all the Marvel foes, he has been reduced to basically giving his outlook on humanity but really has no substance as to why he wants to cleanse the world for only the strong to survive. Arch Angel doesn't do much until the end fighting scene. Psylocke basically followed suit but did the best with what she was given (Which wasn't much at all) and Storm portrayed as she was in the comics and Alexandra Shipp just might make you forget about Halle Berry (even with a believable African accent) The introduction of the new timeline X-Men characters are a fresher take on the ones that we have come to love and trust. Jean Grey is solid and Cyclops is actually played with some kind of conviction. Problem with this is, in an ensemble cast they get taken out and re- added to the shuffle when its convenient to push the plot forward which doesn't give you much time to get acquainted with the new actors much. Of course the person who stole the show in the last movie does it here again. Quicksilver holds it down in all his scenes and the "Mansion Run" is going to be the most talked about scene of the whole movie, ITS THAT DAMN FUN TO WATCH.The thing is this: Its not a bad movie, it was average at best. First Class and Days of Future Past raised the bar for a grand finale that was severely underwhelming. In a series of movies, you build up to the finale and it has to end with a bang. The movie had a couple good action scenes but it cant make up its mind as to what it wants to be and focus on. Is it actually about Apocalypse? Does it want to focus on Mystique trying to find her place in the world? Erik and Charles not seeing eye to eye due to different ideals again? Jean and Scott learning to understand each other? Quicksilver's revelation? There are too many different stories that are trying to be told and if feels like a mess. A bunch of scenes with little or no cohesion. You could see what they were trying to do but the execution was severely flawed.Sad to say that this doesn't look or feel like a Bryan Singer movie, but more like an ensemble of directors that lacked any kind of cohesion with the scenes. The dry attempts at humor and way too much cheesiness only cheapened what could have been a solid send off. This movie didn't end the trilogy with a bang, not even a whimper. It was more like "Meh". Make sure you stay for the end credit scene because marvel fanboys and purists might geek out quite a bit. 6/10

It felt incredible to have experienced such an immersive and overwhelming movie that left me with a proud emotional impression. I'm in danger of gushing I know, stay with me though. We have already had some thoroughly enjoyable and brilliantly done comic based movies this year. The Director Bryon Singer has done it again, only even better this time round. All the characters were reminiscent of the animated series out in the 90s and noughties, and all the better for it too. The story integrated into previous movies, without discord and, had a non linear tact. This enriched the film with a dexterity so easily missed in many action movies of the last decade. I felt warmed by the emotional connection the characters radiated. They reflected proud performances. The pace of the film was well structured. It avoiding the drudgery of some action flicks that, seem to bore with a non stop barrage of blurry over the top action. No, X-Men: Apocalypse was action packed but also engaging and endearing. The various characters were introduced steadily and propelled the story in a cohesive manner. A lot has been said by dullards, about the CGI content being more invasive to the film, than complementary. I can confirm this is how to do it. All effects were not just believable but felt natural and realistic. So much so that in many parts I felt the CGI was perhaps the best I have seen of any movie and, a testament to what is possible with time and effort. Apocalypse is a fine deployment and not as over the top as I was expecting. Quick silver nearly steals the show as he did in the previous movie, but quickly harmonises into the story. I didn't expect to like McAvoys Xavier as much as I have but he really does plug into the role like a charismatic semblance. McAvoy does integrate into the part like a continuation of where Patrick Stuart could have come from before being older. Sophie Turner from the Game of thrones fame is captivating as Jean Grey. Amazing casting credits to the new Cyclops too. Plays a troubled teen learning the hard way to be a bad ass good guy. Even Wolverine plays his part in a non centralised way but owns the scene in a way that is intriguing.This film has it all, and repeat value is massive too. I could see this film many many times before having too much. The opposite of Batman Vs Superman. More emotionally engaging than Captain America: Civil War.I saw this film in 3D 4DX - it adds more dimension to film. Sometimes (like in Batman vs Superman) the 4DX isn't used well enough to justify the extra expense and actually distracts from the film. Not in X-Men: Apocalypse the 3D is smooth and deep. The 4DX is immersive and compliments the engrossing nature of this utterly epic film. The director has delivered so much more than expected, it makes me want him to have a go at doing a Transformers film so the Michael Bay effect can be finally washed away. At the end of the film is the usual intro to another movie so wait for it and you'll see last credits say this film had 15000 people employed in its making and it really shows too. Amazing and superlative in every way.

X-Men: Apocalypse review (spoiler free).Director: Bryan Singer Distributor: Fox Cast: James McAvoy, 2 time Oscar Nominee Michael Fassbender*, Oscar Winner Jennifer Lawrence**, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Sophie Turner with Ben Hardy and Evan Peters, Kodi Smit-Mcphee.Plot: With the emergence of the world's first mutant, Apocalypse, the X-Men must unite to defeat his extinction level plan.After X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) being probably the best in the X-Men series and still is it made all the other X-Men films look pointless. Director Bryan Singer who made three other X-Men films returns with the ninth in the series (including Deadpool) which started back in 2000, 16 years later he directs an entirely new cast.X-Men: Apocalypse may not be as good as Days of Future Past but it is still an enjoyable Marvel film, Charles Xavier (McAvoy), Eric Lensherr Magneto (Fassbender), and Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) all return for the third and last time and those characters leave the series with a bang. With the re-introduction of Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (Smit-Mcphee), previously played by Alan Cumming and Jean Grey/Pheonix (Turner cast because of Game of Thrones), previously played by Famke Janssen the X-Men series seems to be continuing on a massive scale even there are seven previous films.This film has plenty of action and a sort of origin story with the new characters including the first ever appearance of En Sabah Nur a.k.a Apocalypse (Isaac), who is the first ever and most powerful mutant the X-Men have ever faced.Here are some points why I think this is one of the must see superhero films this year: New Characters: Although most of the characters have been seen before for example Nightcrawler, Jean Grey, Storm etc. the film also introduces new characters and they are (only two), Phsylocke played by Olivia Munn and Apocalypse played by Oscar Isaac previously know for Ex-Machina (2015) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). These two new characters make a big impact on the film and on the heroes themselves.CGI good and bad point: CGI is the main component of this film because you think superheroes it's going to be massive amounts of CGI. The CGI in this film literally makes buildings crumble and entire cities get destroyed by the shear might of Apocalypse. In some parts of the film the CGI looks a little incomplete there are few parts where it is unnecessary especially during the main battle where you can clearly tell it is a green-screen. Other than than the CGI is well used and well just a great component.One bad point: Apocalypse in the comics is an all powerful being that all of the X-Men fear even the more powerful ones, but in the film he is powerful but in my personal opinion I feel they picked the wrong actor, Oscar Isaac doesn't play evil well and that's a bad thing because I had really hopes for that character.Take the two good points into account and this is actually a pretty good superhero that does fall a little flat granted but that happens, if this was Singer's X-Men 3, if only he had made X-Men 3. Not nearly as good as Days of Future Past but still a decent addition to the X-Men franchise and hope that the X-Men series still lives on for years to come.Verdict: Enjoyable addition to the franchise with an immense ensemble of characters, but doesn't live up to the brilliance that is Days of Future Past and Apocalypse called have been played better. 8/10 Excellent.*Best performance by an Actor in a supporting role 12 Years a Slave (2013), Best performance by an Actor in a leading role Steve Jobs (2015). **Best performance by an Actress in a leading role Silver Linings Playbook (2012).

As this is Singer's 4th addition to the X-men franchise, it's hard to watch it without making direct comparisons with his previous instalments and whether he's still able to add anything else to the franchise. Whilst Singer does cover familiar ideas in this film, it never feels stale with the themes of social acceptance resonating as strongly here as they always have before and Singer still succeeds at creating new exciting sequences in to the franchise. Taking place after the events of Days of Future Past and still using cast of First Class, a new enemy awakens after resting for thousands of years known as Apocalypse, played by a very intimidating Oscar Isaac whose presence constantly dominates the screen. He's a being who believes he's a god, as he has become seemingly omnipotent having gained many mysterious powers over his several lifetimes including the ability to increase the powers of other mutants. He uses these powers to attempt to bring together four followers and destroy the world in order to start a new empire where only the strongest survive. In many ways Apocalypse is the polar opposite to Xavier (James McAvoy). Whereas Xavier unlocked the potential of mutants like Magneto through helping them reach serenity, Apocalypse uses their pain and suffering to mould them in to warriors he can control to bring the earths destruction. It's Apocalypse's want for control and his power to destroy that unites the X-men to stop Apocalypse and once again save the world. The first 30-40 minutes of the film are quite clunky, with the film jumping all over the place to introduce all of the various characters in to the story. It has to catch us up with all the older heroes after a 10 year gap between films, whilst also introducing an entirely new young cast for some of the most iconic X-men like Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner). Because of this the first act of the film does feel rather slow, but once the film gets going it never slows down until the end credits, being well paced whilst moving swiftly between action set pieces and combining multiple story lines. Fans of Quicksilver (Evan Peters) will be glad to know his role is much larger than it was in the previous film and once again he ends up delivering some of the biggest laughs in the entire film. There are also several great new additions to the franchise. Tye Sheridan re-establishes Cyclops in to the franchise at a point where he's far from the natural leader that we saw from the original X-men trilogy and adds some much needed charisma to the role. Whilst Sophie Turner doesn't have the same hypnotic element that Famke Janssen bought to the role, she does bring to life a far more timid and uncertain Jean than what we've seen before, with the film also setting up some groundwork to redo the phoenix saga in a future film.Also Fassenbender once again has another great outing as Magneto, whose own hatred further sets himself down the path to villainy that he's been forced down since his parents were first murdered. He goes on a very painful journey within the film, with Fassenbender adding a great deal of anguish and tragedy to his character once again. His story also has several great stand out moments, including one incredible sequence where he destroys the remains of Auchwitz, another reminder of how those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. However with such a large cast to use there are some characters who don't get the time that they needed. For example, whilst Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is funny and has a few good moments in the film, there's nothing near the scale of the Whitehouse sequence in the introduction of X-2. Also this is probably the weakest outing for Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Whilst her character arc was one of the strongest aspects for both First Class and Days of Future Past, here in spite of her prominent screen time her role seems so tagged on and unnecessary that she probably could have been removed from the film and it would have been none the weaker because of it. Similarly, new characters like Jubilee (Lana Condor) and Angel (Ben Hardy) feel entirely unnecessary and receive absolutely no character development.Once again there's another show stealing Quicksilver sequence (this time to the tune of Eurythmics - Sweet Dreams) which is just as funny and creative as the one in Days of Future Past, but also adds a dramatic element in to the mix. Singer also found a great way to visualise Xavier and Apocalypses battle of the minds, in one thrilling sequence that see's Apocalypse grow in to a giant to overpower Xavier.(POTENTIAL SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE 3rd TRAILER) However the biggest show stopper in the film is in the weapon X facility and Wolverines (Hugh Jackman) escape sequence. Whilst he's only in the film for a few minutes, this short time does better justice to the character than the entirety of Origins was ever able to, finally unleashing feral Wolverine in a brutal hallway fight that leaves a mass of dead bodies left in Logan's wake. Though one drawback of X-men Apocalypse is that it is a film for those familiar with the franchise only. Unlike Days of Future Past, which could appeal to both fans of the franchise and newcomers alike, Apocalypse relies a lot on its audience knowing about plot lines from past films, such as being already familiar with characters like Stryker and Mactaggert. But so long as you're familiar with the franchise, this film delivers with some great action pieces whilst following in the tracks of Days of Future Past by adding new life in to the franchise.

While Days of Future Past played on our nostalgia by giving us the original cast back, Apocalypse holds the trend by introducing younger versions of them. Jean Grey, Scott Summers, Ororo Munroe, and Kurt Wagner are back, but as teenagers. The core of Xavier, Erik, Raven, and Hank return once again to keep the 'preboot' foundation alive, while Quicksilver, Moira, Alex Summers, and the younger Stryker return as well. And yes, Wolverine too, although in a slightly extended use to his nod in First Class.Unfortunately, Apocalypse doesn't spend a particularly great amount of time introducing brand new mutants and characters. I was really excited to finally see a live-action Jubilee given her long overdue spotlight. I remember her fondly from the 90s cartoon. Unfortunately she's little more than a cameo used to make sure you know you're in the 80s. There's also Psylocke and yet another Angel (I've lost count now), but neither of them are played as anything more than bodyguards, which is pretty much all the Four Horsemen are. Furthermore it kind of quashed the surprise and tension when you pinpointed exactly which horsemen would betray Apocalypse before the movie even started. The lack of development also unfortunately extends to the hyped return of Moira from First Class. Once we hit the third act, I found myself wondering why on earth she was reintroduced in the first place, as she holds absolutely no use beyond a small comical exchange with Xavier early on. For some reason that gives her a right to tag along, where she just sits there and does literally nothing the whole time.Apocalypse himself was a bit of a two-sided apple. On one side, there's no denying Oscar Isaac's ability to play the villain really well. He offers probably the strongest Super-Villain this year (which isn't saying a lot compared to the super-lacklustre Ajax, Lex Luthor, and Zemo we've had so far). Isaac has a way of bringing a godly gravitas and sense of real threat to Apocalypse which was impressive. It was sorely needed because physically, Apocalypse is a bit of a letdown. As talented as Isaac is, he just isn't tall or bulky enough. It felt a little off when Magneto looks him in the eye and they're as tall as each other. The somewhat tacky make-up job doesn't do him any favours either.The rest of the cast do admirably as well though. James McAvoy's Xavier sounds a little lazy and not bothered during the film's opening monologue, but he re-engages afterwards and brings back that young Xavier that could almost be a young Patrick Stewart. Jennifer Lawrence is on par with her previous outings, neither showing improvement nor any sign of slacking. Most the praise belongs to the new cast members. Tye Sheridan does a pretty good job of the young Scott Summers who's just coming to terms with his uncontrollable lazer eyes, and Sophie Turner is a perfect fit for Jean Grey (although her American accent sounds a bit off at times). Kodi Smit- McPhee is completely unrecognisable as Nightcrawler though. Hats off to him. Obviously though, and for the third time in a row, Michael Fassbender is the star of the show. Magneto is again offered arguably more character development than any other character, and Fassbender puts it to good use. Time and again he is the highlight of the movie.Apocalypse is probably one of the most action-orientated X-Men movies around, certainly the most action packed that Bryan Singer has personally directed. He took on quite a large bite for Apocalypse though, requiring an epic and bombastic approach to the fight scenes. Apocalypse is pretty much a god after all. I can't say it's fully successful, as there weren't any particularly memorable clashes (unlike Nightcrawler's attack on the White House in X2, for example), but what we get certainly does the job, without any of this silly zoom-in and shake the camera crap blockbusters are getting increasingly riddled with. It was also really cool to see the unstoppable Apocalypse tackled more than just physically, as Xavier takes him on mentally while everyone else is hitting him with all they've got. It finally takes a hint of what's to come to finally beat him, but I won't spoil it.The effects are hit and miss just like Apocalypse himself. I've mentioned his make-up and costume, so I won't talk about that again, but there is a lot of CGI here. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. Smaller, more intimate uses are great, like people being swallowed up by walls or Apocalypse's growth in the mental battle against Xavier, but the grander moments are let down by a lack of clarity. For example, there's a moment just before the third act where Apocalypse disintegrates a city in order to build a giant pyramid. The screen just gets filled with indiscernible dust for a few minutes as you try to figure out exactly what's going on. It's unfortunately not an isolated incident.Apocalypse was a worthy and enjoyable addition to the X-Men franchise. I look forward to seeing the younger versions of these classic characters return once again, but beyond Wolverine 3 and the Deadpool movies, I feel pretty happy to leave the X-Men movies here, if it comes to that. It wasn't the best the franchise has to offer, but it was far from the worst as well. Thankfully it's self-fulfilling, tongue-in-cheek prophecy of "the third movie is always the worst" didn't come to pass. I give Apocalypse a respectable 7/10

"Days of Future Past", the previous X-Men entry, had visions of a stark post- apocalyptic future ala Terminator, and now comes "Apocalypse", taking cues from eschatological lore with its titular megavillain threatening to destroy all to achieve his own vision of grandeur, forcing the X-Men to unite as one to stop this fallen god. It's pretty darn good.Do not be fooled by its comic-book brand; this is a biblical quasi-disaster film disguised as a superhero film, chock full of thrilling action and urgent, no- nonsense heroics, something that is sorely lacking in most superhero films today (I'm looking at you, BvS and Civil War). Both movies lack the human touch that Singer has given ever-so generously in his films, making the X-Men grounded and human while blossoming with their gifts. The stark difference between this film and Civil War/the DCU shows during one particularly harrowing scene involving Fassbender's Magneto in a Polish forest, which elevates this into a real film with real characters. The humor seems natural, too, save for another scene of fine trolling involving audience favorite Quicksilver that is all too similar to his scene in the previous film.Still, despite a script that offers nothing new to the table, hats off to director Bryan Singer, proving himself yet again as the golden goose of the franchise, for delivering the superhero goods with balanced, kinda old-fashioned storytelling and a plethora of fine performances from all cast members, especially Oscar Isaac as its titular villainous anti-Messiah. It's very operatic, overtly theatrical without being hammy, and it contrasts nicely with the rest of the grounded characters, truly fitting for a villain named "Apocalypse."

Following the "X-Men: Days of Future Past", director Bryan Singer returns with "X-MEN: APOCALYPSE". It's not a bad movie but without the fun, the special effect and action of its predecessors. The too many characters are the film's main problem and I think this movie is made for the fans of the franchise. Unfortunately Bryan Singer proves that he no longer has any interesting X-Men stories to tell and maybe he must stop here. In few words, some of our favorite characters are wasted in this X-Men franchise. No surprises here, just a seen-it- before feeling. It is the weakest of Singer's recent trilogy, but not without its engaging moments.

This X-Men movie doesn't bring anything more to the plate. It still feels like Marvel's baby brother. Not as strong actors, a weak script, bad characters' origins... It's a good action/superhero movie with a couple of great scenes, but it's just too ridiculous in some parts.Now let's get into details. First of all, the bad characters. Psylocke is pathetic. There's 0 origin, she doesn't have her psychic powers as opposed to the comic, she has like 4 lines, and so is just as useless as Bishop was in the previous X-Men movie. Angel is utterly ruined. In the Age of Apocalypse comic books and some follow ups, he's a HUGE part, he's supposed to be Death... But here he's just a jerk kid with no past, no motivation, who gets killed easily. Rubbish. And by the way, Apocalypse is supposed to NAME his horsemen (Death, War, Famine, Pestilence). Nothing here. Storm is kind of OK, but you feel like he picked some weak mutants for the job, apart from Magneto.Magneto by the way has some OK scenes, but the arrow thing ? Come on... Who wrote this ? It's ridiculous. One arrow, two kills ? In real life you can't pierce two bodies with a small wooden arrow and a small wooden bow... Plus there's no Wanda Maximov in the Fox's universe so it's a bit ridiculous to have Quicksilver (which is great again) without her.Apocalypse and Xavier are OK, Apo is a good villain, but again, the script is just poor. You had 3 acts in Civil War. In there, it feels like only one act. Remember the teaser with Mystique supposedly training the X-Men ? No it's not a second act as I was waiting for it to happen, it's just the epilogue... So it feels short, mainly because you have to introduce all those characters and put in some cameos (Wolverine's cameo is quite bad frankly). When they start fighting, there's like 20 min left in the movie... The whole Weapon X thing should have been removed. This is an Apocalypse movie...To me, Beast and Mystique were disappointments again. I still believe the Mystique from the original movies was better. Here she just feels too weak. As for Beast, it's mostly the costume and makeup. It's just ridiculous. He's too thin, and bright sky blue...Amongst the new characters, Cyclops is OK but nothing great there. His origins are too long, he still isn't a leader, and his brother's death feels out of place. Nightcrawler is basically just a tool to teleport the team and they didn't have time for his origin story... In the end, the best scene of the movie is obviously the Phoenix scene, that'll give you chills. They've done it well, but we kinda expect it.All in all, it's never gonna become a classic. The script is too weak, they don't have enough background to built on. Coming out AFTER Civil War makes it feel so small in comparison... I mean we wanted the AGE of Apocalypse. Not just Apocalypse barely doing some damage in Cairo... The horsemen are terrible, but you get 30 seconds of Phoenix... It could (and SHOULD) have been a lot better. X-Men movie fans will probably love it for that phoenix scene, or for the "grandeur" it sometimes displays, and Fox gave them nice little carrots here and there (Wolverine, a bald Xavier, Magneto and his concentration camp past...) but it's just not enough for me, I need a good script. The whole film takes place in what, a couple of days ? Again Civil War had time to develop, with the incident in Lagos, then the accords, then the escape, the fight, the villain etc... etc... Here, it's the origin of everyone, for like an hour, then Apo collecting his horsemen and convincing them at the speed of light (what a sweet talker...), then a 15 min fight. The end.

X-Men: Apocalypse is the latest installment in the X-Men franchise and the third film in the rebooted series. While not on par with its two excellent predecessors, I still found it to be a solid entry into the series. However, I recommend seeing the original two films first.In 1983, the mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) awakens from a millennial-long sleep and vows to destroy mankind and take over the world. With the help of his Four Horsemen; Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Archangel (Ben Hardy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Apocalypse plans to create a world for mutants only. It is up to the X-Men, lead by Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), to work together and prevent Apocalypse and his team from succeeding.Filled with all of the explosive action and comic relief one would expect from the franchise, X-Men: Apocalypse unfortunately falls a bit short of being equally as good as the two great films that preceded it. The story would be hard to follow unless one has seen the previous films. With that said, I still really enjoyed the film for what it was. I particularly enjoyed the way that it expended on Magneto's story and showed how he just wants to be accepted for who he is, despite his mutant powers. I also really liked Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones) as the young Jean Grey. However, it is Quicksilver (Evan Peters) who steals the show in some of the funniest comic relief I have ever seen in a Marvel film. I can only recommend this film to those who have seen all of the previous X-Men Movies, if you haven't then I say watch them first.I rate it 8/10.

It nearly gave me a heart attack, when that girl had a light saber in one hand. And one time she made it to a light whip... (Traumschiff surprise...) 6/10 because its watchable. The start was a bit boring with praying egypts. Where Quicksilver came in, that was awesome. Jennifer Lawrence as mystique was okay. The end fight was a bit confusing (who is fighting for who?) In the middle, there were some funny lines. Charles Xavier was an excellent character. Magneto was awesome. Storm was boring. Wolverine is wolverine. Wolverine is just a beast. The whole story was lame, I think you don't have to watch it at the cinemas, at home is okay as well.

If you already know your film is gonna suck, do something to change it and not just whine about it within the film!First of all, a prequel should be what it claims to be. Preceding, previous, "what happened before". The storyline in this film diverges greatly from the canon of the original movies, in fact making some of this events impossible.The cast is made up of brilliant actors. Unfortunately none really get to show it because animation and special effects and action have now taken over this franchise as well. There is not a single scene where Fassbender or McAvoy could have lived up to their potential. Evan Peter's was purely comic relief and his appearance just a cheap copy of his last one in Days Of Future Past.The X-Men movies always had a wonderful depth to it, mutations being representative of any "otherness" in our society. Now this film about "false Gods" feels like American anti-Islam propaganda. Very disappointing!And last but not least, product placement ruined what was left of the film. Hank McCoy says he made special glasses for Cyclops yet we see the big fat lettering of RAY BAN in every single shot of Scott that follows. The same goes for the scenes that advertised Coca Cola, Michelin,... it was almost as horrible as in Jurassic World.

Apocalypse is the lamest villain I've ever seen in an X-Men movie, it makes Deadpool from X-Men Origins look subtle. I believe this movie has the Dawn of Justice problem, except probably a little better. People would defend it to how close it looks from the comics, when the argument they would point out is only from the aesthetic. Example: The movie may have Psylocke's look, powers and leotard, however remains cipher that it's close to Batman v Superman's Wonder Woman. The movie throws in a ton of characters and cannot even juggle enough from them, especially when it comes to Jean Grey. She is supposed to be important to the story, but her arc is rushed and her involvement from the climax felt extremely unearned. Fans of the old movies might find the returning young characters such as Cyclops and Nightcrawler fun, but that's only for the sake of familiarity and if this is the first time you've encounter these characters, then you won't find anything remarkable from them. Good performances do help, mostly from Michael Fassbender, even when Magneto here is underwritten as ever, he manages to make a rather contrived sequence quite powerful. But even then, when he starts becoming the villain again, the bombast just compromises every talent on screen.The movie is heavy on CG, but short on tension. All we see are spectacle, that it gets too exhausting that you're almost like watching a Roland Emmerich movie. It all looks cool, but there is nothing really exciting about it. To be fair, it's still quite watchable and fans might go crazy about its fan service like Wolverine (it's shown in the trailer,) bald Professor X and Mystique wearing her original costume. But even with these aesthetics, it's still pretty empty. These characters are too burdened from the past that it's kind of missing the point.Oscar Isaac tries, but the role is just too silly to be taken seriously. James McAvoy does his best as Xavier. Tye Sheridan is the best cinematic Scott Summers so far, but that isn't saying much since this franchise never even cared for this character. Michael Fassbender is seriously the only one who can exceed from the film's shortcomings.Overall, X-Men Apocalypse is pretty to look at, but the lack of enough connection with this rich amount of characters and tension towards the situation and the villain just rob all the fun. It's far from boring, at least. You can find worse ways to kill your two hours, but still, it's like the Mutant Apocalypse game; if you're looking for some action that looks like the comics, then you may have a blast, but movies aren't videogames. There has to be a story to impact the experience. And there is rarely any elements from the story here that actually flow. It's far from a blunder, but X-Men movies have become better than this. This movie is nothing more than a bucket of candies.

The strength of this movie certainly relies heavily on the extremely cool looking CGI. We see cities being turned to dust, incredible displays of power from the mutants (especially magneto), and the villain is possible the most powerful we have seen in a Marvel movie so far.However, due to the nature of this film being another prequel, being set before the days of the original X-men films, I never found myself fearing for the fate of the main characters. We knew that they would live through this. Whilst you could also say the same perhaps for the films X-men: First Class and X-men: Days of future past, somehow those movies carried a little bit more dramatic tension. Perhaps this was due to the fact that in First Class, many of the characters would not later become X-men, so their fates to non-comic book fans was a mystery. In Days of Future Past, the time-line was in schism so the outcome of the movie actually could change the time-line of the original movies (which it did for the better in the end.In Apocalypse, however, there is no doubt that the cast would survive, although it was at least intriguing to find out how such a powerful villain could be defeated.This is also quite a simplistic movie- there are no complex morals like "are mutants and humans able to live side by side". The villain motivation ultimately comes down to wanting to rule the world. Speaking of the villain, Apocalypse, he was quite menacing and ruthless, but comes not even an iota within the brilliance of Ian McKellen as Magneto, and his character was no where near as developed which isn't surprising seeing as he came and went within one movie.So really, to sum up, this movie is a cool looking spectacle, but lacks dramatic tension or any build up, and there is no challenge of morals to the audience. I consider it to be above only the two Wolverine movies in the franchise, but it is my least favourite main time-line X-men movie. Also at almost two and a half hours in run-time, the plot feels incredibly stretched out. The whole sub-plot of being captured by the soldiers felt ultimately pointless.If you are a true X-men fan, you will probably find some enjoyment from this movie but overall I can't recommend it as I found it quite boring throughout most of it- even the action scenes are quite reminiscent of the "Transformers" Franchise in that it was flashy but lacked great choreography or tension. A lot of the humour also fell quite flat for me, but the other cinema goers laughed so perhaps that's just my sense of humour for you.Final rating for me is 5/10 - average and takes no risks. In terms of Marvel films recently, it was rather disappointing.

Yep if you are a fan of the previous x-men movies made by Singer , i think you will love this one. The story begins with the introduction of the Apocalypse character, although brief it just tells you how he disappeared for all these years and after millenia he awakens once again from followers that sprung once again with the last incident of the x-men saga.The small details of the film gave this movie a thorough and realistic (as it can be) atmosphere which i really loved, the action is explicit especially in the final half hour , very detailed and really well done. Apocalypse in my opinion was well made and he really was very powerful. I bet their are many Easter eggs to be found in this movie and their is one really awesome cameo that i loved ( not saying to spoil it :P) , the scene with Quicksilver is indeed 10 times better that the one in the last movie! Fassbender was awesome once again so was McAvoy. The only drawback of the movie for me was for about 15-20 minutes around the beginning to middle of the movie i got slight bored cause it seemed that it dragged too much , but the feeling was quickly vanished !! I recommend this movie to all the X-men fans, and not listen to the movie critics and see for themselves if they like it or not!

Excess of CGI, lights and rays everywhere, the villain is ridiculous, the script is lazy, boring and incoherent, Bryan Singer destroyed all the good things Matthew Vaughn did in First Class, it was a great reborn of the franchise, and now we returned to same we saw in Xmen Last Stand...Some of the scenes are foreseeable, the casting of some mutants is awful (nightcrawler, storm, cyclops)The only good thing in this movie is Quicksilver scene, the rest is a waste of time.Apocalypse is laughable as a villain, his make up, the costume, and his lines in all movie are over exaggerated (is not Oscar isaac's fault) is because the horrible script

Five years ago, in 2011, When director Bryan Singer released the movie, x-men first class. As a fan of all the x-men movies and all of the franchises related movies (Wolverine's). i enjoyed the movie, but what kept reappearing in my mind was, "where does this movie belong?". i wasn't sure where this movie was meant to fit in the time-line. was this movie a reboot? was this movie a prequel? Did this movie even know what it was?. There is a big stigmata against reboots and prequels ever since the star wars franchise expanded beyond the confinements of George Lucas's original Star Wars trilogy. But...Bare with me, This movie is amazing. For you to fully understand the x-men universe and the time-line/story, i truly recommend that you the leave "x-men origins: Wolverine & The Wolverine" out of your watch list, and... treat those movies as standalone, non continuity, pure entertainment movies. Because they are good movies, their just extremely confusing when you try to piece the x-men trilogy with those movies and then the new movies (first class & days of future past).Yes! Days of future past does incorporate time travel from the time period of the original movies (think more current, modern times, 2000s, mature grown up x-men), to the 1970s! But its to stop everything bad from happening in their future before it has even begun. Apocalypse, picks up a few years later in the 80s, after the events that happened in days of future past. This movie is very very good! i personally rate it 8 out of 10! How about you?

I had heard some mixed reviews for this film and I don't really see where the negative ones come from because this is a fantastic addition to the X- Men films. The premise sees the film set 10 years after days of future past and an ancient mutant has woken up to destroy the world. James macavoy is back as professor xavier and he feels closer to the character then ever before. He does a great job as a headstrong leader that has to show strong mentality to the characters around him. Michael fassbender reprises his role as magneto and he is easily the most interesting character in this film as he tries to recover his life but he has the pain in his life that makes him drawn to apocalypse. Jennifer lawrence is back as mystique and she is great in the role. She provides a complex performance as the character that makes you care about her character. Oscar isaac plays the villain apocalypse and even though he is underneath allot of make up he delivers a performance full of depth. He is a charismatic leader that allows you to understand why his allies would join him. All the other cast do a great job too, quicksilver has lots of stand out moments and depth to his character. Nightcrawler, jean grey and cyclops also deliver great performances and are good characters. The story of the film continues this series of films very well as a new group of mutants are developed and grow. Even though the villains plot is pretty simple it works because of his depth and delivery. The script has a good blend of drama and humour like all of the singer X-Men films and it helps develop some of the supporting characters such as quicksilver and Cyclops. The style has some great action scenes that come straight from the comics and makes the stakes of this film seem huge. However, the pacing of the film is a little all over the place especially for the first 30 minutes where it tries to set up a few different plot lines and it feels a bit disjointed. Overall this is a fantastic comic book film that is amongst the best in this franchise.

Acts as a direct sequel from the ending of Days of Future Past, Singer continues the main themes of family, struggling to accept oneself and the challenge of letting go of the past in expanding this ambitious mutants universe, though slightly mess up but it is still a competent film. It starts off at a fine pacing with several pieces of subplots to reintroduce the old members, decently surface the villain but due to overloading of stories to tell, there's a lot of flaws especially at the final act as well as some underdeveloped new characters. The story still focuses on the three main characters - Xavier (Professor X), Erik (Magneto) and Raven (Mystique), all deliver promisingly just as previous installments that leads to a very engaging chemistry together with powerful scores by John Ottman, visually stunning effects and a number of fun moments delivered by both Professor X and Quicksilver (although the latter seems to steal the attention much better in two major scenes). The theme of hope might not be quite resonant this time and it might not be the best entry in the trilogy but overall it's more humanly emotional engaging and certainly one of the quite successful superhero trilogy reboot.

The scenario keep on his way but it doesn't bring anything new at all. The first movies of this trilogy were amazing thanks their scenarios but here I just got the usual about-face.I didn't watch it in 3D, it might be better because the main part of this movie was to show off spectators. I like good effects but there were not so good and some of them really useless.I gave a 7, it's not a bad movie, I appreciated winks and actors performance particularly but none of these scenes took my breathe away as they tried to do.And Jesus please ... stop to leave before the final scene !

I'd say this movie is great, enjoyable, but it could be better. When i was watching the first part of the movie i think that "this movie could be better than the days of future past" until it reached like 70% of the movie. It could be improved in the last 30% or 40% of the movie, The four horsemen appearance and part in this movie could be better and more exciting. at least improve the big battle part it could be better and more more exciting. If you're a x men movies fans you'll like it better because the reference from the previous movies are make it more enjoyable and there are characters from previous movies that make you understand more and enjoy it more if you've watched all previous movies.

I loved it. Brian did a great job in the time he had to develop the extra characters bearing in mind he had the main story to tell too, so kudos to you there mate. CGI smeegi, really nay-sayers, the faults were so minimal, you'd need to be going to see the film for the sole purpose of showing the world what an amazing negative force you are(trying to be polite here folks). Really, come- on the movie was pure fiction for comic book lovers and anyone who loves sci-fi. Brian and the cast did an amazing job of providing 144 minutes of pure eye popping entertainment. The X-MEN story continuity was well maintained and the material was as close to the original comics as one could do in a 144 minute movie. SO all, do yourselves a favor and ignore the critics who prefer you to see horrible real life snotty dramas with political correctness and sexual orientation shoved in your face and buy yourselves a ticket to see this genuine entertainment spectacle.

Since 2011, I've been praising Matthew Vaughn's "X-Men: First Class" as one of my favorite movies of all time. Witnessing X-Men: Apocalypse has still left me in shock at how the 3rd installment to the prequel trilogy has now made my 'all-time' list too. No spoilers ahead, but I will say this: WHAT A FINALE!From hearing John Ottman's 'Suite from X2' in the introduction to the new and equally hilarious Quicksilver sequence, this film really does have it all. Given you've seen "First Class" and "Days of Future Past", I strongly urge all movie goers to see this conclusion. The audacity critics have to slay this film is beyond me, they really have lost their touch. Please don't be another sheep in the crowd and listen to those morons, believe me, buy yourself a ticket and see how this piece rounds the series off well. P.S. This is my first ever review. If a man has purposefully created an account just to review this film, then you know it's worth watching.

This is a spoiler free review cause you don't need spoilers before going to see this movie. Is absolutely amazing how finally Bryan becomes more faithful to the comics and they paid attention to a lot things that the community complained about it past movies. This is truly a masterpiece movie. No character feels left out, all of them have a big role to play and all of them show a really incredible display of power during the movie. Go see it the movie is awesome. My only advice is not to watch the trailers, videos and clips cause they spoiled too much. You wan't regret this. It is really a awesome movie with a great feeling of X-Men.The reviews saying that the movie is bad are all misleading cause everyone who goes see it, love it. On my theater everyone during many moments cheered a lot. And the final part of the movie is just memorable.What I liked the most about this movie is that it really showed the powers of the characters at their fullest and it didn't focused only on some characters, it focused on all of them with a great pacing.

Personal opinion, as these always are- if you're a fan of the X-Men films, ignore the critics and enjoy yourself, because Apocalypse is FUN!The movie picks up the threads of Prof X's and Magneto's story ten years after DoFP. Both characters are in a happier place - they're older, less inclined to fight, both living a measure of peace through their version of family. Until, as is always the case, it all goes to hell in a hand basket. It's a big, loud, colourful production. Silly costumes and explosions are a standard, much as they are in the comics. Also, cool superpowers x1000 make the fights pretty epic (and who are we kidding, that's part of why we pay the ticket). In fairness to the critics, it's a bit choppy, trite at times, somewhat over the top and too upbeat for the dark moments to hit as hard as they probably should. Apocalypse is undoubtedly the weakest villain yet (neither power-hungry and devious like Shaw nor cynically inquisitive like Transk, he ends up being the most banal of world-dominating super-villains in a while). But!For a fan of the franchise, this film feels a bit like coming home. It combines the hopeful youth that made First Class so good (and very successfully introduces the younger generation X-Men) with the high stakes, high profile, world-ending battles of DoFP. Overall, loose threads from the other two movies are (mostly) tied up, and you get a little bit of everything/everyone as the First Class generation conflicts draw to a close and leave room for the modern X-Men. Despite being flashy and titanic in size, it still manages to end on a simple, hopeful note similar to that on which the franchise reboot began.Thinking of seeing it? Expect an epic superhero film made mostly for fans of the franchise, with all the characters you know and love and the classic highs and lows of its genre. And obviously, spandex.

I really really really enjoyed this movie, I remember sitting in the cinema watching it thinking "I need to watch this again, quickly!" This was a roller-coaster of film which did justice to both the comic world and the world of film, and that's something I haven't said about other comic inspired films much. This is the best of the X-Men films, even better than "Days of Future Past" which took some doing, because that was previously the best of them. If I'm honest, the reboot/ new timeline has done the X-Men franchise the world of good, the films are bigger, better and darker - something the X-Men definitely deserves. I personally think they are partly responsible for the success the current MCU and DCU are having. This is the 4th superhero/comic film of the year, I personally think this is better than "Batman vs Superman" and "Cpt. America: Civil War". As an immersing spectacle to tantalize the senses this is on par, for me, with the "Deadpool" film, and I really enjoyed that, but for different reasons. The film was set in the 80's and delivers for the actual time period with feelings of fear and nuclear war, as well as the colour and the sound of 80's fashion and popular culture. It also delivers on the feeling of early X-Men comics, fear of mutants and man's need to control them, with characters looking to find and understand themselves and what they are capable of.Brian Singer directs and has used the new timeline created in "X- Men: Days of Future Past" to wonderful effects to weave a great story. The film introduces En Sabah Nur, or Apocalypse, the first mutant, woken from a deathly slumber about thousands of years. Events transpire that allow him to enlist his regular 4 horsemen to serve him and bring down humanity. His aim is to cleanse the world of the weak (humans and anyone that opposes him generally) and build the world again with him as it's ruler. Standing in his way are the X-Men, who themselves have journeys and story's unfolding at he same time. I don't want to spoil anything so that's as far as I'm taking the synopsis. The cast is brilliant and believable throughout, not just can they act but as an Englishman it's nice to see a Brit heavy cast delivering sublimely. Established characters as well as new appearances make great showings, nobody seemed out of place here. The emotional variances and deliveries were brilliant throughout, giving you everything from love to tragedy, fear to fascination, comedy to conflict. The action scenes were top notch and suited the characters in the film very well. With each unique character, a different power, and each variant is acted and delivered with class. Sometime the CGI and cabled action shots were a little obvious and overdone, but it was still damn fine eye candy and didn't ruin things. It actually served to offer the comic book physics that I'd expect. The film isn't afraid to set up a story at over two hours but it didn't drag at any point, I couldn't wait for more to happen and I certainly look forward to more X-Men films like this one. Stay tuned for the usual post-credits scene, if you know the MCU and X- Men comics you'll figure out who might be pulling some strings in the next movie and like me you'll be ready and waiting. A thoroughly well deserved a 9 out of 10.

The ancient Apocalypse returns and wants to destroy the world. For companions, he recruits those of the emo teens who don't already go to the School for the Gifted and provide annoying angsty melodrama. Bryan Singer recreates some of his most beloved moments from the series with less effort, and sticks in bits he was previously forced to cut. Like X3 and First Class(which happened 20 years ago. Ignore that no one looks to have aged by anywhere near that much), the main threat and the team are two separate plot lines fighting for attention. Then they smash together at the end.Some claim this has a lot of action. Not at all. There's almost none, outside of the climax, which isn't that impressive, or memorable, in spite of what the director has done in the past. Civil War does, you could watch that again. But there we do have Roland Emmerich style destruction, which this is oddly callous towards. We're going backwards. Young versions of characters, most of which were already wasted. At least give us new ones. Or do them well. Comic relief is hit and miss.There is a ton of death, with blood and brutal gore on corpses, and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone needing reminding just how wildly the quality of this film franchise fluctuates. 5/10

I agree with other reviewers here. How the critics have got this one completely and abjectly WRONG. You absolutely must go see this film if you are an x-men fan; it's astonishing.The newcomers are wonderful. Sophie Turner makes an excellent Jean Grey (perfect in fact), and although I really didn't think anyone could replace Famke Janssen well in the role, it's happened quite automatically here.Mystique's role is not overplayed, and the villainous aspect of her character that's more prevalent in the source material is no longer missed; in fact, I quite like this Mystique now. Also, make no mistake; her presence does not overshadow the other characters in any way, which is something I think a lot of people were worried about. On the contrary, every character shines quite brilliantly here. Some of the more B characters don't get a huge amount of backstory, but that's to be expected in such a large universe of characters. This is especially true in a film with this monumental villain, a secondary arch villain, and seven or eight major X-men players, not to mention the core of Xavier, Storm, Jean, Cyclops, Magneto and in other places — Wolverine. So the critics are completely off base there again.Oscar Isaac's performance is fantastic, and contrary to what critics have spouted, his on screen presence is not diminished by the makeup and costume; it is merely enhanced. The sonic affects on his voice create a visceral experience, and elevate the character to really menacing proportions. Apocalypse's design looks perfect in most places. It's not so great in just one or two moments, but it honestly doesn't matter — either way, this villain's transfer to the big screen is truly excellent. His commentary about the iconography and false promise of modern western culture struck a note that I frankly think has gone well over critic's heads. I mean, can anyone name a supernatural villain who actually wanted to launch nuclear weapons into space? Excuse me, but this is pure genius!The tension between him and Xavier as the film moves forward is riveting. His towering, overpowering presence during the psychic battle is awesome, and his mocking taunts here really bring the character to life — even going beyond the comic book. Jean's eventual entrance into this battle — coming to Xavier's rescue — has to be the most heroic moment in the entire franchise.Throughout the rest of the film, expect lots of great, explosive scenes, lots of intimate character building moments, and another highly memorable, sweet moment between Logan and Jean (during his excellent, extended cameo), which is truly beautiful.The emergence of Phoenix, finally, after sixteen years, is more than welcome. It has to be seen to be believed. Apocalypse's last words, "all is revealed" upon seeing Jean's power unleashed — this simple sentence is a work of genius, incredibly layered and with huge subtext. It's the perfect juxtaposition between a false God, who, in shock, speaks these words when he is presented after all that time with a young girl who could potentially have the power of a true God.So who wrote the line? Singer? Kinberg? Tell us!The scene also really gets to some truths about the original X-men team that were absent to a large degree before. For instance, we see just how close Jean is to Xavier. She is referred to as his 'star pupil' at one point in the Ultimate series I believe, and I think that sentiment was always there in the original book too. They truly have a very special, very unique bond, and it's paid homage to here in a really beautiful way.This is a truly wonderful addition to the X-men franchise. Can't wait for more. (And thanks Singer, Kinberg, Dougherty, Harris, Donner etc.)

First things first, I liked it. Not loved it, but really liked it.There's no going around it. It's a CGI crap-fest from the first scene to the last. With that being said, most of it looked pretty good. A few scenes where I thought "Man, this is going to look bad on my TV." And some scenes where amazing and made me wish I'd seen it in 3D. It starts with a fast paced scene to set up what's to come. Then it takes it time introducing us to the new characters, and show us status-quo on old ones. This is probably not helping on the 2 hour 24 minutes run time of the movie, but some of the characters would probably feel a lot more shallow without it. Then, when it finally kicks in gear, there's no turning back. A lot of great action scenes and some CGI bullsh!t that looks cool, I guess. I don't know much about the phoenix saga, other than that Brett Ratner screwed it up in X-men the last stand. therefor I can't say how accurate or well depicted it was in regards to the comic, but to me it was handled well. The acting was great. McAvoy, Isaac and Smith-McPhee stood out to me as Xavier, Magneto and Nightcrawler. the others did a great job as well. Some in recurring roles and some newcomers. Like Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan as Jean Grey and Scott Summers. Jennifer Lawrence, however, is pretty much phoning it in at this point. She looked like she wanted to be anywhere but there. One of the scenes with quicksilver stole the show and was worth the price of admission alone. On the bad side though. In a market saturated by superhero movies, I'm afraid this might go down as just one more drop in the sea. It's great entertainment, but I'm probably not going to remember much of it in a month. Could be wrong though. Totally justifiable to spend your hard earned cash on, though.

Huge fan of the comics here. As X-Men: Apocalypse began, the opening scenes instantly took my breath away. DAMN good!! Apocalypse's subsequent awakening (due to the meddling of Moira MacTaggart!) and search for his four horsemen were also pretty great. I loved seeing Scott Summers and Jean Grey. All the great stuff with Magneto was also nearly perfect. The movie builds up to its climax for a long time, and it's all good (though not quite perfect) - but once the climactic events begin in the second half of the movie, it all goes off track. First Apocalypse sends all the world's nuclear weapons into space - a cool sequence... but, we think he is going to use them; use the raw power they comprise. Instead he just throws them into space, so humanity can't use them. Even though he clearly wants to destroy most of the world. Doesn't make sense; it deflates the inflated audience expectations. Next, in the true climactic fight, nobody's motivations are addressed in the least. Magneto changes his mind, and soon after some of the horsemen do, too, but we don't hear why! We hear no reasoning of any kind! It's a fight in which the good guys practically only win the day because most of the bad guys decide to switch sides for no adequately explained reason! It's as if the movie just suspended its storytelling, gave up on all characterization and just relied on nothing but visual spectacle to wow the audience and carry the climax.Sadly, it doesn't work. Another of the main things that doesn't work is when Jean Grey "phoenixes out". The flame bird looks great and all, but the whole point of that character is that she is transformed by the change - and she wasn't! Not in any way at all! This was really annoying! I was so excited about what she would become now; whether she would break out as Dark Phoenix or at least just Phoenix, but nothing at all happened except amping up her power level. There was no effect on her character. That is almost as disappointing to me as the last time they botched the Phoenix story, namely in X-Men: The Last Stand, where they just had her standing around and doing nothing. WTF?!X-Men: Apocalypse had too many characters. Storm and Psylocke in particular got hardly any real development; we didn't hear their motivations and except for Storm at the very end, they didn't get a chance to be heroes. Mystique also had very little to do in this movie. She brought news of Magneto's change, and she brought Nightcrawler with her, but she didn't have much else of consequence to do. Her power level was too low to influence the final battle. They should have done more with her, and shown us what connection she had with Stryker, as per the end scene of the previous movie. A lot of the problems with this movie seem to be caused by having had to make it in a damn hurry. They should have waited a year and spent the time working out a better story.Still and all, with all the action and cool characters, this is still a damn good-looking and entertaining superhero movie. I still rate it an 8 out of 10, even though it's best in the beginning and just gets weaker from then on. A good thing I haven't mentioned yet is the music. I really thought the music worked very, very well in this movie.X-Men: First Class (2011) was an astonishingly great movie; 10 out of 10. Days of Future Past (2014) was also fantastic; so many great details and a very cool and complex story: 9 out of 10 stars! Sadly, X-Men: Apocalypse is yet another step down from that level; it's a furious chase movie with a weak plot and villains whose motivations aren't explored in any detail, and some of whom (Magneto!) changes allegiance for no apparent reason. Such a shame! I really expected better from Simon Kinberg after the extraordinarily well-made two previous X-Men movies.

...it doesn't add anything new to the franchise or the genre.The more substantial change introduced to the franchise since it started back in 2000 was the refreshing of the cast in 2011, operated by Matthew Vaughn in a prequel filled with plot twists, multi-layered characters and style that set the origin of the current narrative web. The return of Bryan Singer after X-Men: First Class seemed to promise a continuation of this refreshing of an old franchise, as Days of Future Past gave us more innovation, plot twists and multi-layered characters, as well as one of the best scenes in the genre with Quicksilver and his speed. However, Apocalypse seems to have taken away the freshness the two previous films brought to the franchise. Where First Class and Days of Future Past innovated, Apocalypse merely recycled plot lines and scenes from previous installments (realy, how many more times do we have to see Magneto loose his family, go on a rampage to avenge them, only to have his mind changed at the very last minute by having either Professor Xavier or Mystique tell him he has good in him, that he's more than just his pain and rage? Hasn't he heard that enough times already? Haven't we? I mean, if he didn't get it the first two times he heard it, he never will). Where First Class and Days of Future Past had a multi-layered villain, Apocalypse has a one-dimensional, almost clownish bad guy - his motivation is basically "let's destroy this world and build a new one because I was assleep for 3000 years and woke up in a bad mood". Oh, and what was that with him destroying all the nuclear weapons of Earth? I was hopelessly reminded of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and the very similar plot line of Superman also destroying all the nuclear weapons of Earth, and that's not a good thing since that film was total rubbish. And didn't Apocalypse have the intention of destroying the world anyway? So why bother to destroy the nuclear weapons first? The fact is that this villain should be called Disaster, for that is what he is and no amount of amazing special effects can change that. Which is a shame, when you have someone like Oscar Isaac playing him.The truth is that Apocalypse seems to confirm that superhero movies are increasingly becoming an "assembly line" at risk of a creative emptiness, one that not even an amazing cast like this one can save from mediocrity.In short: even though it was put together with the best of Hollywood's technical expertise, and Quicksilver has another amazing scene in it that is worth a watch (although it does beg the question: why repeat something that had already been done in the previous film? Were the filmmakers that devoid of inspiration? You already now the answer...), this film is essentially more of the same, treading a path already (and more expertly) tread, without bringing any special grit or inspiration to the franchise. To be watched at home; save your money for something more worthy.

By far the best superhero movie of the year. I would like to see more overpowered people in Marvel movies such as Sentinela, Thanos, Galactus... Great move by putting someone as powerful as Apocalypse in it :). Well, talking about that, it would be pretty amazing to watch a movie of Sentinela in it, he is one of the most amazing superheros forgotten by Marvel. One of the very few things that I didn't like about the movies was that Sansa Stark is Sansa Stark! Its hard to see her as an Xmen hero. Also, Havoc didn't have to die so soon, we almost didn't see his amazing powers, I was a little disappointed with that. The rest of the movie was very solid and I keep thinking about the Xmen getting in the same movies as Avengers since they look like to be in the same universe. Actually, I guess that everyone wanna see they together.

Despite a deep love and affection for the source material, the characters, the filmmakers and the franchise, I could not overcome the bloated film I was presented with, which despite preserving some key elements that constantly make these stories emotionally powerful, can't come together in making any kind of organic film, which messes up one of the most fascinating characters in comic book history.Right from the opening scene, introducing Apocalypse, you will get what I am talking about. I was immediately turned off. The X-Men have always been a very grounded saga, with emphasis on character, yet what this scene presents us is a tonal shift of unbalanced proportions. The CGI extravaganza is all over the place, the suspense of disbelief the films ask us is way too demanding to have any kind of attachment to the narrative.These are problems that carry through the whole film. Firstly, on a technical level I have to say that this level of CGI is almost unacceptable from a major blockbuster film. The green screen effects are embarrassing throughout the whole duration and keep distracting you every time characters appear in front of it. The composition overall is terribly distinguishable and the combination between practical and CGI is all but seamless. Moreover the wide shots of CGI landscapes all look way too unconvincing. I don't know what it is, the suspension of disbelief, the rendering itself, the way it is used, it simply didn't add up.On top of that, we have a really bloated storyline where character motivations are frustratingly confusing and it all originates from the sadly underwhelming villain at the center of it. Look, I will not hide the fact that I have been a comic book reader all my life and of course when I go to see these movies there is a nostalgic and excited part of me, but that part comes in only after you give me a good film, if at the core of it you don't have one, my knowledge and nostalgia will rarely fill the gaps. Moreover, screwing up such an iconic character adds to the disappointment. Apcocalypse is one of the best characters ever committed to CB page, what we have here, other than the fact that in the first place doesn't resemble anything close to his printed counter part, is a villain so bad it makes me angry. He has no depth, no motivation, no menace and worst of all he is all powerful! The mistake of having a villain that seems to be able to do anything is really annoying, it takes away any kind of grit or personality.I have to say I really liked the casting of the renewed characters, they were almost all inspired choices that delivered. Tye Sheridan and Sophie Turner were big highlights of the film. That is also probably due to the fact that the characters they are playing, alongside all of their fellow actors, are incredibly layered to the point that they could be considered mythological. Their struggle and inner dynamic is so strong, complex and emotionally powerful it is really hard to alienate an audience with them. These filmmakers know and have demonstrated in the past how thrilling and touching these stories can get, how much this tale on diversity, peace, love vs hate, self loathing (the list goes on and on) opens up the possibility of commentary and discussion. They demonstrate they know all of this in the film which sporadically offers genuine moments of this, only to be taken down by the plot that moves too many elements around and screws up the flow of the film.Bryan Singer has had his first failure in this saga and whilst it isn't a disaster by any stretch of the imagination, it just reminds you of how good X-Men, X2, Days of Future Past and to an extent First Class and (for me) Last Stand are.

Saw it last night. With all the negativity surrounding this film, I expected to come out somewhat disappointed. But my view was quite the opposite. Loved the story, Magneto was great, liked his back story in the film. I thought that Apocalypse was one of the better villains, although his power wasn't really shown in the film as it is in the comics. The new younger xmen characters all did the characters justice. Really liked nightcrawler, thought he was one of the better portrayed Xmen.The film was well timed, liked the pace leading up to the final conflict. I would quite happily see it again. Ignore the critics and go see it :-)

X-MEN APOCALYPSE REVIEW - Finished watching one of the most Anticipated Hollywood flick of the year XMen Apocalypse and i am thrilled. Kick Ass, Faadu, Brilliant, Outstanding and bla bla, in 1 Word (in Indian Language) K A D A K.... Certainly Best Xmen series film i've watched. Better than previous Xmen films, Avengers Series in short Best Hollywood Flick of the year 2016 so far. We usually don't expect Quality film making and script from Money making entertainers but if we get Good Script with lots of entertaining elements then we call that film a Classic and exactly same happened to me after watching Apocalypse. I don't call it a Classic but yes Film has surpassed my expectations and has forced me to watch it again in theater. Probably first Hollywood film of 2016 which i will watch 2nd time in theater. Excellent writing, Tight screenplay with zero loo breaks, Outstanding VFX and 3D effects and a perfect paisa vasool entertainer as a whole. Xmen Apocalypse doesn't disappoint you in any field. The main reason is its screenplay which is entertaining throughout for 145 mins despite very less comedy. Visual effects and 3D Effects are best for any Hollywood film recently. First half lefts you on interesting note which doesn't easily happen with other money making entertainers, and then 2nd half completely surprises you with Good worthy a perfect climax. Wolverine surprises in his 2 minutes cameo. Erik's son is surprising element because of its Lightning Fast speed super power. Overall i don't have any minuses to count, this is a Perfect Entertainer for Hollywood lovers. I'm giving 8/10 stars which is really high for this kind of Entertaining Genre film. Go for this one, if you're really looking for a perfect Hollywood Entertainer and i'm sure Film won't disappoint you.

As much as I am a fan of X- Men series this one disappoints me a little bit especially after Days Of Future Past which was by far the best X - Men movie and one of the best comic book movies . Apocalypse was more menacing in trailer than in the movie because he doesn't do anything in this film rather than giving powers to his Horsemen . First half of the movie is pretty slow and I think that they went too far to build up hype for Apocalypse which he doesn't stand up to . Its the second half and Quicksilver that made us to watch the movie . Quicksilver is the best in this movie I mean all his scenes are well made especially his entry . All the actors did their job perfectly , its their roles that I think were short. Like Four Horsemen should have been more terrifying but they didn't do anything except Magneto . Second half is definitely worth a watch for visuals and characters because everyone gets to shine and has its moment in second half and now I come to the cameo , yes The Wolverine , his scene were very good and he was shown as the animal as he is in comics , more ruthless and more dangerous than he has ever been in movie which I think was very good for him because its what Wolverine is . All thing this movie does is that it is very good to eye but nothing exceptional . You can sure watch it but with not so much expectation but I'll say watch this because of Quicksilver because he is the only one who can make you enjoy this movie .

This year in super heroes so far: Deadpool Awesome, Dawn of Justice Entertaining but could be better, Captain America Civil War Fantastic and X Men Apocalypse.satisfactory.Following on from the previous brilliant X men films Days of Future Past and First Class, X-Men Apocalypse raises the roof several times to a whole new realm of action, destruction, and of course mutants. Now Xavier's school for mutants has become a proud established academy with many students, but a new threat has risen from the earth. Apocalypse rises to bring about a new earth and kill all life but with the help of four rogue mutants.To start off, X-Men Apocalypse defiantly promises what it delivers in the trailers and on the posters, so for the fans looking for what they see in the trailers is exactly what you get. However, this isn't a super hero masterpiece, but it is very entertaining and enjoyable. Probably not the best out of the X Men series, but impossibly no the worst. I would call this the Age of Ultron of the X-Men universe, or the better version of Man of Steal (associating with how much destruction there is).Before I talk about negatives I will go over positives: good performances by cast (especially Sophie Turner), good direction of narrative to an extent, great score, entertaining, hype building, explosive, slightly funny, and cool use of costume.One of the main problems at the beginning was that there was too much going on, and there are numerous stories going on a the same time so it gets quite crowded. Not just with the story but also characters. It tries to pull focus on too many characters which makes it kind of each person gets their time in the spotlight feel. It is also far too long, which doesn't make you bored but does slightly drag on a bit.I will also say there were moments which I call were awkward tense moments. This is when there are brief moments in the dialogue which try to be significant but are not delivered correctly. For example in Force Awakens when Ren and Rey are fighting and he mentions in a bad delivery 'I can teach you the ways of the Force' One of the strong but also weak points 0f the film is its very strong use in visual effects including CGI and editing. This consists of some remarkable scenery to be admired, but it is very repetitive and could make one dizzy.Overall X-Men Apocalypse is very entertaining, and is fourth out of eighth' place in the series. I understand its hard to always top the previous film, but this still doesn't quite reach the momentum of Future Past or First Class, but is still very good. 8/10

I generally do not write reviews about any movie, but after watching this left a sour aftertaste that drove me to review this. It seems Bryan Singer made this film based on these 8 guidelines:1. Magneto must be the victimized anti-hero who gets his life messed up in the worst way possible, turns evil, and eventually betrays the evil to join the side of the good.2. Juicing the hell out of Quicksilver's slow-mo scenes, because everyone loves it since DOFP.3. Some of the good guys must die. Even if the death is lame, forced out of nothing, or has no impact on the plot, just do it. Because audiences love that emo s**t.4. Show the world that there are new characters coming into the film so there's hype. Then give them 1 minute of screen time and 3 lines of dialogue for the entire film.5. Reveal a truckload of subplots, but no need to follow through. Just gotta look fluffy, no substance needed.6. Romance and sexual tension is also a must. Doesn't matter how it is done, or why there is a need to have it in the film.7. Always have a hidden mojo ready, in case there's no convincing way to get rid of the bad guy and end the film.8. Huge plot loopholes are irrelevant as long as we have the power of CGI to juice the hell out of all the planetary destruction scenes and the final battle scene. Because screw logic and just go for visuals.With that said, the film felt like Bryan Singer just wanted to get everything over and done with. Just from watching the trailer alone, 95% of the plot was predictable, and the dialogue became very boring very quickly. The only saving grace was the great acting from the cast. DOFP was great but I really have serious reservations about this one.Well, at least now I know what Apocalypse meant when he said "Everything they've built will fall..."

I think the critics from Rotten Tomatoes left the movie in the first half hour or were just jerking off to Storm. She was hot though. Not going to lie.X-men Apocalypse. Third in the prequel series. So the whole scenario takes place soon after the events of DC. Humans and Mutants have started to bond together whereas in rural parts, mutants are still hated upon and are used as circus freaks. The advent of the 1st mutant known as En Sabah Nur has put the existence of humans in jeopardy and it's center are the X-men and the Four recruits of Apocalypse.The story is fairly simple. A dark mutant who has transferred his consciousness from time to time and has wreaked havoc when ever humans grew stronger than the mutants. This time he is back again and he goes on to recruit his four followers so that he can get back to being the ruler of the world. The only people who are going to stop him are the X-men. So on one side Apocalypse begins to recruit Storm, Angel, Psylocke and finally Magneto. He enhances their powers to make them almost invincible. On the other side we are introduced to the ones who are going to become the X-men. I'll give it points for not stopping to show how each of them are recruited. Everything keeps flowing in a parallel time-line. Apocalypse comes to know about Xavier and his power and he understands that he is his next vessel because through him he can control humans and mutants alike.The pacing of the movie is not very fast to be true. It takes a lot of time to bring us to the midst of things. I had a major problem with the placement of the humorous scenes and the sad scenes. One of them was the death of Alex Summers. We get this next awesome QuickSilver scene and right after that Alex is dead. The humour doesn't seep in and that is why we can't exactly sympathize with Scott because his brother has just died. One of the emotionally strong scenes was the death of Erik's family. The scene was also reminiscent of a scene from 'Guardians of the Galaxy' but obviously more riveting. Plot points like Stryker shows up to take away Mystique, Beast, Moira and Silver seemed a little forced so that we can get the cameo of the Wolverine and yes, so that they can get a jet. One of the most down-points of the movie was Apocalypse. His presence wasn't as deadly as it should have been. The apocalypse of the world took way too much time. If he had made the four horsemen to go to different parts of the world(because he travel from one place to another) and made them cause destruction that would have posed a much more of a challenge for the X-men.Acting wise almost every one is on their A-game. Now we have another funny man on the X-men, NightCrawler. He was aptly characterized. In the comics he was always quipping, but not very smart things. He really stole the show. Sophie Turner more or less plays a mutant Sansa. I liked the new Scott. Olivia Munn hardly talked in the whole movie but she looked great. The new Storm will be good in the upcoming movies. Jennifer Lawrence is Raven Everdeen(hope that is self explanatory). Returning actors like McAvoy and Fassbender and Hoult are amazing as usual. Fassbender a bit more especially because of that scene in the forest. Angel's character was forgettable and he died too, so that's that. Stan Lee doesn't have a funny cameo this time. Oscar Isaac was tremendously under used. I know he is a great actor and he plays negative roles very well but this just didn't click for me. Hugh Jackman will be missed considering that cameo. Hope we could have had at least 10 more movies of him as Wolverine.The movie is not anything epic because the standards are just getting higher and higher. It definitely propagates the plot forward but doesn't satisfy considering it is almost an end-of-the-world movie. First Class also had the destruction of the world in it's center and it had more stakes and more heart than here where there is a God trying to cause destruction. I am happy that the new lot of actors portraying the iconic characters from our childhood will do it justice and hope upcoming sequels solidify the X-men universe better

Completely disagree with the bad rep for apocalypse ....that is finally what an xmen film should be, that was a true to the comics and original animation as possible, critics will hate it, the popular people of movie goers will hate it/won't understand but that was for service to true xmen fans that was exactly the film it was supposed to be !Every weak point mentioned is completely wrong. That was exactly how it was meant to be, it was accurate. It was how I'd imagine the story being. I think a true xmen fan will see what it is. To the avid novice film goer maybe not but to every critic in the world on this film, they can go lobotomize themselves because this film wasn't for them. Every character got a fair crack considering there was so much going on. There was a little story to each one at least and all got a fair shot with their powers. This film was bang on finally singer is fixing the what others have messed up.Only little notes tho, when will they stop underwriting jubilee for god sake! you might think she's annoying but she's part of the furniture and should be treated as such. finally a proper phoenix in Jean Grey! (although not mentioned at all in the film so technically not a spoiler) Bit of a waste killing havoc and arch angel (which they only called angel) but then nobody would die. The only thing I didn't like about days of future past is that they silently killed off all those interesting xmen from first class without a good explanation except that they were "tested on" and weren't used any further. But as i said before to wrap up this is finally pointing in the right direction anyone who hates this movie please jump off a cliff! because this film isn't for you its for the true fans and everyone else can jog on !

Really not understanding all the hate from critics on this one, its not without some faults but nothing that majorly took away from my enjoyment, if you already love the x men movies you should love this, i'd rate it 3rd just behind 1st class and x2, admittedly if you're not already sold on x men movies this probably wont change your mind but fans should love, don't listen to the critics too much, i think most of the criticisms I've read for this movie could also be put towards civil war but everyone loved civil war so overlooked its faults while trashing this, my main criticism is too many flashbacks, this is the 6th x men movie, 9th if you include the wolverines and deadpool, by now it should be assumed anyone watching is following the series and doesn't need flashbacks, all the new cast were great and have got me excited for future x men movies, fassbender and macovoy were great as usual, Oscar Issac was cool as apocalypse, quicksilver stole the show again along with a great cameo that i wont spoil if you didn't already get it spoiled in the trailer, trust me, check this movie out

Alright so this is my first time writing a review on IMDb, just for the sake of this particular title.X-Men: Apocalypse has a slow start in beginning, a lot of characters had to be introduced so a lot of background stories were re-looked here and there. It was pretty hard to follow at first but slowly everything makes sense towards half-part of the movie. Then comes the climax.... I was so immersed by the action packed scene with my mouth wide opened. (plus PLENTY of goosebumps). CGI was top-notch. I mean we are talking about the world-coming-to-an-end-destruction-scale AKA. APOCALYPSE. Kudos to the effects team!!!NOW, the casts. Simply marvelous NEW X-MEN (Jean Grey, Cyclops, Storm etc etc.) Quicksilver stole my heart in every hilarious scene he is in, as per Days of Future Past. Few heart-wrenching scenes came from Magneto (Michael Fassbender) as well. All cast played their parts well be it major like James McAvoy or minor like the NightCrawler kid, they cant obviously fit every character into 144 minutes *too many*Point is, this movie is not overly-done. I can tell that everyone in my cinema were so thrilled and satisfied at the end-credits. You MUST watch this flick if you are one true X-MEN fan. P.S: Do not compare it with Marvel/DC/other superhero movies as they are not relevant. Just sit back and enjoy OK? :-)

This is one of my favorite X-men movie series.The best of mine is Days Of Future Past but X-Men Apocalypse is difference because there are many interesting thing as follows: Acting of Jennifer Lawrence and James are perfect furthermore the opening of the movie is spectacular!! I cannot explain how much I love it because it is cool! Actually I like Egyptian scene and it makes me stunned. I hope to see Jennifer Lawrence,James McAvoy,Michael Fassbender and Hugh Jackman in the next X-men series because all of them make this movie fabulous the most.Moreover I wish to see Mystique movie if it is possible because this character is mysterious and interesting. However I will be fans of X-men forever.Thank you Bryan Singer for the great movie.

I have had the pleasure to watch several superhero films despite not having read a single comic published and while i admit to enjoying a few i never understood the popularity of the genre. These movies while at times fun never seem to carry much depth even compared to blockbusters such as star wars, jaws and dark knight.I thought the previous x men films were mediocre and forgettable with days of future past being the strongest entry into the franchise.I had only low expectations going in to this after having to sit through the awfulness of batman v superman and the mediocrities such as civil war and dead-pool, hoping to find the gem in this average genre.Needles to say i thought x-men: Apocalypse was the best x men movie produced as well as the one of the better superhero films of the last century.This movie showed me a glimpse of that gem i was searching for in this genre and have somehow restored faith in the comic book movies or at least for the next x-men installment.The first half of this movie is just brilliant and probably demonstrates the best of the superhero films.Most of it is done visually without relying on dialogue(which is great considering the fact that the screenplay is the weakest part of every superhero films). The opening sequence was fantastic as it laid a foundation of the story without giving any expositions like civil war did.There is a quiet feeling in the first half giving calmness and needed emotion in the movie and moments such as magneto's daughter's death, quicksilver's dash in flames as well as the bursting of rockets works perfectly giving the film an aura of calmness and energy as well as tension.Now this film is far from perfect as shown in the second half where the brilliance of the first half falls, becoming more Hollywood with the cliché redemption, weak villains and end of the world fights excess of CGI.Despite these problems the final fight is enjoyable due to the craziness of the situation and in my opinion the battle was much more memorable that the airport fight in civil war due to the primal existence of stakes and emotion in the fight between the characters.Also on a positive note the film is never once dull.The cinematography is great when comparing to other superhero films and the music was exceptional and really helped to bring this movie alive and grant.The performances were fine, though nothing really stood out.James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender steal the show with their respectful performances with the supporting roles doing just an okay job.Even Jennifer Lawrence is tolerable with her character.There is a wolverine cameo late in the film which was effective in establishing the character and even managed to provide a screen presence of a larger degree than both superman and captain America did in their respectful movies in the year's superhero installments.So overall x men: Apocalypse stands out as the superhero film of the year 2016.It somehow manages to find a balance between the dark and gritty nature of batman v superman without becoming somber or dull as well as the lighter tone of civil war and dead-pool without becoming jokey and thereby losing the tension.It's not a great film but a highly enjoyable and memorable blockbuster as well as one of the best superhero films ever made.

Seen the movie today. The experience was awesome. Really loved it. DON'T BELIEVE THE CRITICS !!!! The critics are being too harsh on this movie just like BvS and both movies were awesome. Go in and form your own opinion. The story was nice but predictable. The action scenes were amazing. The CGI was much better than Deadpool and Civil War. The characters were really well introduced. Bryan Singer didn't disappoint. The ending was a little cheesy but OK. The movie build-up is good and keeps you interested. This is the 3rd good X-men movie after Days of Future Past and X2. Oscar Isaac acted amazing as APOCALYPSE. But the show stealer is QUICKSILVER. QUICKSILVER stole the show single-handedly. AMAZING. Bryan Singer understands Quicksilver better than the producers at Disney. Don't't rely on critics, they get paid to bash a movie. Go in and have a good time because it is a good movie.

Similar to "Batman v Superman" opinions divide greatly on "X-Men: Apocalypse". While Rotten Tomatoes is not fond of the movie, audiences and a great many people love it. In the end all this does not matter since everybody has to decide on their own whether they like a movie or not. And after all it is good that each person has a different opinion on a piece of art because it is fun to discuss and learn other people's views. "X-Men: Apocalypse" is set in the 80ies and adds a lot of new character portrayals to the franchise. The movie starts out with the awakening of Apocalypse, him learning about the present world and recruiting his four horsemen. A young Scott Summers discovers his powers and arrives at Charles Xavier's school for gifted youngsters, where he meets Jean Grey. Meanwhile Mystique grew to be a role model for many mutants since the events in the 70ies while Eric lives secluded with his family in Poland.First of all, there are many aspects I loved and enjoyed about this movie. The performances in this movie where overall good. Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender prove again they are fantastic in their roles and we witness some good character developments. Especially Magneto has some emotional moments. Evan Peters stays the greatest Quicksilver ever put to screen, this time receiving more screen time and another outstanding scene even better than the one from "Days of Future Past". Olivia Munn is great as Psylocke and it would be cool if we get to see more of her character in the future. Nightcrawler was awesome as well! Unfortunately there were some performances that were not as great. Sophie Turner as Jean Grey was not my favorite part of the movie. I respect her as an actress but there were some moments in the movies when I could not help but see Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones on screen. Also Apocalypse left me disappointed. Oscar Isaacs is a great actor and one can tell he did his best but to me En Sabah Nur is another generic villain. He had some cool powers but I was not fond of his design and most of the time he was more annoying than threatening. In general the look and design of some characters bothered me (looking at you Angel and Storm).Additionally there is a section in the middle of the movie that felt forced to me, even though it is understandable why they had to put it into the movie but still this could have been handled better or left out and it would not have changed a lot about the plot. In general the plot is the main problem of the movie, since some parts felt unnecessary and forced and sometimes the movie is slow, though I would not describe it as boring. Furthermore some scenes were way over the top! Especially the end battle with a great amount of it involving Jean Grey. It felt stupid.As much as I hate to say this, but "X-Men Apocalypse" is my least favorite superhero movie this year and ranks rather low on my list compared to the other installments of the franchise. It had great moments and was enjoyable but it still had too many things bothering me about it. Stay in your seats for the post-credit scene though!

This film tells the story of how mutants become stronger, how they unite and betray one another in a fight against an ancient Egyptian God that aims to destroy the world and rebuild from ashes."X-Men: Apocalypse" is filled with my favourite stars, and I have been looking forward to watching it. The story is a bit slow paced because there is a lot of detail to be told. How each mutant comes about, and how they befriend, familiarise and cooperate with each other is told. There is a lot of background story, and at times I think the story could be a bit faster.Fortunately, the film is filled with very good visual effects, such as the scene of the College exploding. That scene showcases the great visual effects achieved by the team, and provides comic relief in an otherwise tense scene.For the post credit scene, there is a bit of a pause between the end of the credits and the post credit scene, which made the cinema goers wondering if they sat through the credits for nothing. After watching the scene, that thought did cross my mind, unfortunately.

When i read the preview reviews of the movie I was like OK. it might not be great but Im going to give it a chance. But when I saw it I was like what's happening with the critics?? The movie is amazing. x men apocalypse follows the path and style of First Class and Days of Future Past. All characters are great and the way that Singer choose to mix all together is really great. Of curse there are some details that could be better, like the Apocalypse design, but common people the movie as a combo works totally amazing, I don't know why some critics are trying to stop people of going to see it. My opinion is that the movie is great and totally worth it, give it a chance.

More doesn't always mean better. This time however it works well. X Men: Apocalypse is massive digital effect swarm, but surprisingly the story doesn't get buried under all the effects. Story is set on 80's during cold war era. Picture of the time has bring freshly to set, although it won't bring all the cliche's of that time to silver screen. The iron curtain and cold war era has brought well on set. Somehow the story reflects nicely that period manly world, but surprisingly strong women are the last and only hope for the human kind. There are of course some weakness in story. There are so many characters, that story have difficulties enough to no-one's background. Maybe that is not a big problem here. Massive effect rumble is so beautifully implement that there is enough spine for weak story. 3D is executed spontaneous well. The story is not extraordinary, but movie's razzle-dazzle is so entertaining and beautiful and collection of great young actors and actress satisfy easily. Limits of movie madness is tested on this movie. Does it means that we have finally reached all what these digital effect movies has to offer? I don't think so as long as people are ready to pay price of a movie ticket to see them.Movie is typical summer blockbuster movie. Massive effects, action combined to a light story makes people to wander to ticket window. And there is nothing bad in it, you pay the price easily, especially when it has produces so well, than this is. Shameless entertainment.

Stop reading here if you don't want to read spoilers!There is a scene where two people are killed by a single arrow shot with a basic small wooden bow. This scene actually had me in tears, from laughing so much at the absurdity of it all.Without giving too much away; the 'bad guy' is holding a very basic wooden bow and arrow and he is BARELY pulling back the bow when he is momentarily distracted, so he accidentally lets go of the bow causing the arrow to shoot straight through the bodies of TWO people. Now I'm no doctor but I'm pretty certain that the human body contains muscles, bones, cartilage and all sorts of bits and pieces that would make it very difficult for a rudimentary wooden arrow to shoot through. Not only did this arrow by somehow make it through one body, by some miracle it went through a second as well! If this arrow was shot by Green Arrow, Hawkeye, Legolas or even Princess Merida from the movie Brave then perhaps I could have believed something like this could have happened... but instead it was achieved by a minor character with no known special abilities or skills without even pulling the bow back or actually aiming.It's officially the stupidest death sequence I have ever seen.The rest of the movie is okay, but it's not life changing. Whilst it's stupid at times, it's still watchable and hey maybe you'll like it?

I personally thought Days of the Future Past to be the best of the series. And as it turns out, Apocalypse is the worst one to date.The only bright spot in all the awfulness is Quicksilver, whose slo-mo scene is at least as good as in the previous movie, if not better. Other than that, everything else goes from mediocre to outright terrible.The main villain's motivation is bland and stupid. (Yeah, he just wants to kill everyone and rule the world.) The way he "persuades" other mutants to join him is absolutely unbelievable - he basically just offers to increase a mutant's power and in return demands help to kill billions of people. Sounds like a fair deal. What's offputting is that the extent to which he augments his followers' powers is not constant. Like, Magneto gains the power to control pretty much all the metal on the planet at once, while Psylocke gains another special effect on her CGI laser beams or whatever it is that she emits. Apocalypse's abilities in general are largely undefined - at times he is shown pulling matter from objects around him to construct something, and then in the next shot he just makes solid objects like armor out of thin air. Another ridiculous thing was that they tried to make Isaac more intimidating by giving him thick soles so that he'd look taller, which is noticeable. What is more, his lines are cringe-worthy, but the problem is, so are everyone else's. Same boring cliché dialogues like "It's your home. We will help. Join us, Eric. I see good in you."Yeah, forgiving Magneto like it's nothing after he helps to kill millions of people and destroy entire cities is included in the package. Also, he changes his mind about the whole "destroy the world" thing after Mystique tells him for the 100th time that he is her family and she still sees good in him.Some of the characters' looks are still beyond ugly. I can actually see why they chose to try to keep the Beast and Mystique in their human forms more, except for saving the actors from the extensive make-up procedures. The thing is, these characters look absolutely god-damn atrocious and are painful to watch. I mean, Lawrence is annoying and redundant when she is on screen anyway, but when she is also blue, it just becomes vomit-inducing.Recent 2016 comic-book blockbusters also did not enjoy good scripts, but at least they had high-quality gripping action scenes. This is not the case here, as fighting is mostly goofy and bland, and at times it is clearly visible by the actors' motions that they are being pulled by the strings. Or being drawn in cheap CGI.This is actually sad. Singer's previous movie, DotFP, was outstanding. The recent Deadpool, who ostensibly shares the universe with the X-men, was awesome. And now we get a horrible, outrageously stupid and pretentious CG-overdosed mess. Let's hope the next one will be better.

X-Men: Apocalypse continues with the adventures of the X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier(James McAvoy). This film takes place 10 years after the events of X-Men: Days of Future Past(2014). Charles has been successfully running his school for mutants. However, everything doesn't stay rosy, with the re-emergence of the world's first mutant, En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse(Oscar Isaac). Apocalypse is unhappy with the world of today. So, he sets about destroying the world, as we know it. Apocalypse takes the help of, Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto(Michael Fassbender), Angel(Ben Hardy), Ororo Munroe/Storm(Alexandra Shipp) & Psylocke(Olivia Munn), to execute his malevolent plans. Now, it is up to the X-Men led by Charles Xavier, Raven/Mystique(Jennifer Lawrence) & Hank McCoy/Beast(Nicholas Hoult) to stop Apocalypse & his followers, from bringing about the destruction of the world. X-Men: Apocalypse is an outstanding film. Director Bryan Singer continues to make flawless X-Men movies after, X-Men(2000), X2(2003) & X-Men: Days of Future Past(2014). I am really happy, that they finally introduced all the fan favorite mutants like, Jean Grey(Sophie Turner), Scott Summers/Cyclops(Tye Sheridan), Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler(Kodi Smit-McPhee) & Storm. The visual effects are fantastic. The destruction set pieces, are one of the highlights of the film. The Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver(Evan Peters) set piece, tops the Quicksilver set piece from X-Men: Days of Future Past(2014) & is another highlight of the film. The climax of the movie is epic & is a fitting finale to the trilogy of rebooted X-Men films, that began with X-Men: First Class(2011). The 3D is eye-popping & has been put to great use, in pretty much every scene of the film. However, this movie is not just about the action & destruction set pieces. The script by Simon Kinberg, Bryan Singer, Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris, makes you genuinely care about each & every character. Not the titular villain, of course! The audience will love to hate Apocalypse. The performances are another highlight of the film. James McAvoy is spectacular as Professor Charles Xavier. McAvoy's performance is more akin to Patrick Stewart's portrayal of Professor X, this time around. No need to fret though. McAvoy makes his portrayal of Charles, his own. Michael Fassbender is flawless as Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. Fassbender effortlessly portrays Erik's grief & rage. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Raven/Mystique. Nicholas Hoult is awesome as Hank McCoy/Beast. Oscar Isaac is great as En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse. Rose Byrne is impressive as Moira Mactaggert. Evan Peters is incredible as Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver. I am so glad, that Peters' character has a much more important & fleshed out role, this time around. Josh Helman is effective as Col. William Stryker. Sophie Turner is superb as Jean Grey. Tye Sheridan is perfect as Scott Summers/Cyclops. Lucas Till is good as Alex Summers/Havok. Kodi Smit-McPhee is excellent as Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler. Ben Hardy is impressive as Angel. Alexandra Shipp is great as Ororo Munroe/Storm. Olivia Munn is awesome as Psylocke. The supporting cast is effective. X-Men: Apocalypse is a must watch, for fans of the X-Men film franchise. Go, be thoroughly entertained!

I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and I was so afraid that I'd be disappointed. Luckily, I was not. This X-Men has surprised me the most. Actions scenes are thrilling, music is magnificent, CGI as well. Acting is great, James McAvoy has outdone himself. Probably the best superhero movie of the year so far. I'm not sure why Rottentomatoes criticized it so badly. It keeps your attention because there is so much going on throughout the movie. The mutant I liked the most was definitely Quicksilver(Evan Peters). Funny character, with his own scene(which was my favorite) who kept the excitement of the movie to it's end. TL;TR Good and exciting movie. Characters are awesome. Go and watch it, don't look at Rottentomatoes or any other site that has written bad about it.

After reading some mixed reviews about this movie I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to see this one in cinema. I was a teenager when the first X-Men movies came out, and I liked them a lot back then. But now I'm almost 30, so it's not that often I go to see superhero movies - I've missed Deadpool and Captain America - Civil War this year (and Batman V Superman was big pile of sh*t to be honest). You could say I've lost my faith in superhero movies - or maybe I have grown up.But I decided to give this movie a chance. Mainly because Michael Fassbender whom I have enjoyed as Magneto and because Oscar Isaac is the main villain in this movie. And those two actors are the best thing this movie has to offer.The plot is entertaining, and the movie opens with epic scene from ancient Egypt. The movie makes Magneto even tragic character than before and Isaac's Apocalypse is probably one of the coolest villains of all time. Apocalypse is scary and vicious at the same time. And I gotta give it to the makeup department; Oscar Isaac is very nicely transformed into Apocalypse.And now I'm going to give some minor spoilers, so don't read ahead if you have not seen the movie yet.We get to see how Storm got her white hair and how Prof. Xavier lost his hair. You might have never thought about those two things, but after seeing what happened to their hair, the mystery is finally solved (at least to those of us who have not read the comics)! If you remember the movie X2, you might remember the dam where Wolverine was held. So when this movie goes to a dam with same looking wintery scenery, you just might get some goosebumps. You guessed right: yes, we do have Wolverine!!! For about two awesome minutes Hugh Jackman is slicing up people. That came as a surprise for me because I had not expected him.X-Men: Apocalypse introduces many new faces and does a good job doing so. Quicksilver has also "his scene", and it's a lot better than in Days of Future Past - and that scene was great too.I don't think there is much to complain about in this movie. Well maybe Sophie Turner as Jean Grey. I don't like her in Game of Thrones, and I didn't like her now. She's just not that good actress. Too bad they're probably ruining the future X-Men movies with her.This movie is the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight Rises (I know, it's DC and this is Marvel). If you have hard time choosing between this and Captain America, go see this one!

Movie starts with promising note on the backdrop of Egypt, Pyramid and first mutant. Bryan has tried to syn up story with Days of future past and First Class. Slow motion rescue operation by Evan Peters was full of entertainment. Guest Appearance by novice Wolverine was awesome. First half was better one and Second was unable to carry momentum due to less effectiveness of Apocalypse and four horsemen. This installment is definitely better than previous Days of Future past. However this one unable to match up the level of First Class. James and Michael duo the show with their natural performance. Visual effects were treat to watch since from beginning.

S-P-O-I-L-E-R-S Ahead !!!I don't know why people hated this movie so much. In opinion it was really a great movie. But not up-to the level of X-Men Days of Future Past. First 15-20 min of the movie was about Apocalypse. It was kinda disappointing because I want to know why Apocalypse want to destroy human kind what instead it just show me humans hated him and betrayed him. But after that movie started catch its speed. For me the show steeling moment was Eric's loss. That moment was so powerful and emotional that it could even make a cold hearted person cry. Michale Fassbender acting was just awesome. Action sequences were pretty damn awesome. Like the Days of future past again Peter steel the show. But my fav was the Wolverine berserk mode action scene. Awesomeness of that scene was unspeakable. In that 10-15 min scene Fox fixed all the wrong they did in the X-Men Origin Wolverine movie. What I didn't like in the movie were Apocalypse, his horsemen character motivation. Well Oscar Isaac did a great job as Apocalypse but what I didn't like was they didn't treat him like Apocalypse. As far I know Apocalypse is one of the most powerful super villain, he can shape shift he can project energy blast, telekinesis and many more powers that makes him a god like being. But Peter beat him like he is nothing. All other horsemen except Eric has no character motivation. I mean why would Psylocke(Body Guard), Angel(Fighter) and Storm(Thief) want to destroy the world. So basically this movie is not a bad movie which some people claim that it is worse than the Last Stand movie. Bryan Singer did a great job. Great casting of character.In my suggestion if you are a X-Men fan you'll love it.

I think it's time to give up on X-Men. they are getting less and less creative with every movie . Yes i enjoyed it and it was well produced and great acting . but the plot wasn't enough satisfying . obviously bringing a huge weird shaped villain back from death or creating it is a very popular plot now adays from action movie . c'mon guys it was failure on avengers and look pretty well here too. also the movie suffered lack of Wolverine , a very slow start and screen playing didn't rhythm with events. still worth watching , you gonna catch some funny moments and some cool action .

The movie was pretty amazing, so f**k all the critics. I think that the critics see these kind of movies as stand-alone's. They miss the point that they are a part of a series and are meant particularly for the comic lovers. The basic idea of these movies is that over the years, the ever-so-popular comics have held us in trance, and now we can see the characters and their stories live on the big screen, performed by excellent actors (read ordinary humans). I think that's the kind of psychological trick that does it for the superhero/comic-based movies (I'd include Bond movies too). You can't judge it in the ways you judge a movie from the realistic genres. I think its high time specific critics developed for this genre or the existing critics to get an update on the 'criticizing'. The star, for me, as usual, was The Wolverine. The way the scene was built up took me back to the same for Dr. Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (I know, too much romanticism, But it was a real treat to watch). I'll really miss him in the forthcoming movies, if Wolverine III is really the end.Sophie Turner (as Jean Grey) adds another jewel to her already dazzling tiara. She is quite an actress for her age.

Keeping this short.Not without its faults but it was a great watch hardly stays idle. Didn't lose my interest at any point. Magneto oh how great he was towards the end he gets put back a little but the feels were strong.Quicksilver was amazing. Loved him puts a smile on your face.Cyclops and Jean built up nicely as well as Nightcrawler. Angel wasted but probably wasn't a fit for this movie on general. Best Xmen movie by far because it's not centered around Wolverine (as good as Hugh jackman was the movies were awful) and everyone in the main cast got to play a part.The villain himself was worthy but the choice of minions not so much.Purely on an entertainment factor I put this above both BvS and Civil War. Both of which I gave a 7 for different reasons. This does not try to be overly epic or blast open a door to a series of new movies. It gets an 8.

This... This movie is an insult. It is not even bad, it's more than that. I have seen bad movies, and maybe due to the insane amount of brainless superhero / comic book films recently, but this is more than simply bad. More than 2 hours of downright mind numbing, meaningless, cliché filled bull***. How the hell did this movie got more than 5 start is beyond me. After a few hours i seriously tried to find some good parts in this film, and don't get me wrong, there are good scenes in the movie, but the whole experience is just shocking. In the wrong way.You may be wondering if you should see this movie despite the awful critics, ignoring the signs you have been given. Don't. Or do, but at the end, you will most likely be just like me right now, wondering what the hell did you just see, why, and who the hell let this come out under the x-men franchise....I can't, and i won't... No... I have to take a shower...

Me'n the missus headed off on a date-day to the movies and we saw, by mutual agreement, X-Menapocalypse. It's always a good opportunity to suss out what may tickle our future fancies and there was a poster advertising 'BFG' which quite took my fancy until the child-bride hushed me correcting me in front of strangers by pointing out that it was a 'Big FRIENDLY Giant'.The X-Men starts off quite well. It is set in ancient Egypt and there is a pyramid and we get the chance to say 'Oooh, we've been there' and there is a Klingon who is going to be made live forever by getting dead-guy juice from, well, a dead guy. But things go amiss due to various heroic efforts by blokes with spears and a great big rock that slides into the pyramid. The Klingon, who turns out to be the first mutant and who is called Apocalypse, is buried. I think that's his name anyway. I can't remember anyone actually calling him that but.He's reanimated of course. If he wasn't it woulda been a PFS movie. He learns our languages by watching Egyptian TV. Good luck with THAT. I know two words of Arabic. 'Laa' and 'Insh'allah' both of which practically mean 'No' Apocalypse doesn't really carry off the super-powerful nasty. For a start, he wears platform shoes and these diminish his air of malice significantly. The impression is more that of an unimaginatively made-up Gene Simmons than, say, your full blown Sauron, the Dark Lord. Or Darth Vader. He puts together an army, and it's a pretty small one – 'the 4 Horsemen' but they don't have horses so the are just the 4 Men. Well they aren't all men so they aren't even that. The 4 Skins? Dunno. He gives them X-men gifts which are surprisingly modest given his supposed omnipotentness. Whips and skimpies are fine for relaxation, but not really your first choice for world domination. He does have a formidable weapon in Magnet-Man who gets a fancy-dan helmet and can do good hovering Apocalypse and his 4skins are pitted against Sansa Stark, whose time with the funster Ramsay Bolton has taught her a trick or two about survival and some of these tricks are going to make future intimacies unpredictable at best and positively lethal if she's 'just not in the mood'.A contractual obligation is met when Wolverine takes out a heap of baddies then runs off to duel bears and suchlike.Nuclear weapons are unleashed on an unsuspecting solar system. The Sydney Opera House is destroyed.I won't spoil the experience by giving away the ending, although a sequel that is also a prequel leaves little room for maneuvering on the outcome.Would've been heaps improved with Deadpool and Daenerys Targaryen. What wouldn't be improved by Daenerys Targaryen? We've suffered so you don't have to!

I put my reviews very short as you might see in the future. Anyways..I was very skeptic how they could do something better than THE Quicksilver scene from Days of Future Past. But.. they actually manage to do a scene that is even more epic and hilarious. It was very visual experience and most of the CGI have been done very well. I had kinda mixed feeling from En Sabah Nur since I waited it so much. And I really wanted it to be overpowered as he should be. I had some things I didn't like that much and some things I liked a lot. Don't want to spoil anything and since this is spoiler-free and quick review I list pros and cons to bottom.++ Michael Fassbender as Magneto: (Maybe the best thing in the movie!) ++ Quicksilver as goofy and kinda overpowered character ++ Visuals + James McAvoy as professor X + Storm +- En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse (as a character, powers kinda felt limited) +- "New" Scott Summers (kind of a side character) - Stryker ( I didn't like the "young" Stryker at DoFP and not in this) -- Psylocke (kind of a boring character with no bigger meaning) -- Jean Grey (you'll see if you haven't yet)

The x-men movies evolved over the years, and that's a good thing. There is so much potential left en there is so much more to tell. If you have not seen X: First Class (2011) and X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), I highly recommend to see both before watching this one.The movie starts a little bit weird, with Egypt people taking of their masks and there is one guy who grunts weird. I thought, no please don't let this high budget movie be filled with bad actors. And luckily, besides Alexandra Shipp, it wasn't.X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) has little action sequences in the first half of the movie. The first half it is about building up a story what leads in the second half to all the action we are used of this kind of movies. I was afraid the movie would feel a bit cartoonish, but that was not the case.From all the characters I like Evan Peters who played Quicksilver. This guy should get his own Quicksilver movies. He is so hilarious. It is a shame his relationship with Magneto did not have a satisfied ending. But maybe that will come in the next movie. At least I hope so.Good movie, worthy to be in the line of the x-men movies.

Having watched Days of Future Past, which I thought was by far the best X-men film i'd seen, I had high hopes for Apocalypse, regardless of reviews which didn't seem too promising.I have to disagree with some of the reviews here about this film - it wasn't particularly good. It just slots in with your run of the mill superhero film and won't be remembered when the sequel is released.Positives:Some of the action scenes are excellent. CGI seems to have improved again in recent films and Apocalypse is no exception.I think the casting of Sophie Turner and Alex Shipp is a great move. Being a GOT watcher, I liked her introduction into this franchise. I'd never seen Alex before but that girl can do something different with Storm and move away from the Halle Berry rendition. Not so Positives:It's getting difficult to do something really different with these kind of films; there wasn't any shock (for someone that hasn't read the comics). Having seen Civil War recently, this story really lacked that unique edge, whereas it's competition had me from the beginning to the end. Apocalypse as a villain bored me. I won't lie. He could have been so much more exciting! Instead it was just another bad guy wanting to start the world over again. It'll be interesting to see what happens next with the X-men Franchise. With the end teaser, hopefully it will be something new to keep up with the other Marvel projects that are leading the way.

<Movie title is American Hustle>

'American Hustle'. A amazingly entertaining and engaging experience. A successful (in my opinion) juxtaposition of art and entertainment. A wonderfully acted and directed film.Full disclosure: I loved both 'The Fighter' and 'Silver Linings Play', plus the cast are some of my favourite actors working in motion pictures today. So, I went in with a bias and a high level of anticipation for this film. This can sometimes work against you as a viewer as your expectations are too higher and you are disappointed with the results.I can say that I was not disappointed and absolutely loved the film. People take different experiences and sensibilities with them when they see movies, and mine led me to be engaged and empathetic towards the characters. Their story interested me and I came out of the cinema thoroughly enjoying myself.My only criticism is that it felt it lacked a little something with story. After seeing the film I did read that a lot of the film was improvised and Christian Bale commented to David O'Russell that this would change the story. His response was that he cared about the characters more than the story (paraphrasing). On reflection this is evident as the characters and acting are first class.I by no means acclaim this to be a perfect movie or the best movie ever made, but it worked for me. I loved it!

The 'based on a true story' we so often see at the beginning of a film has been a recurring Bête Noire of mine for some considerable time. I have argued before that the licence it gives to film-makers is open to the widest interpretation. It is a specious use of language. It allows writer and director to re-frame events, dissemble, misrepresent people, and, if challenged on points of veracity, hide behind the fact that it was never claimed to be a truthful recall.The Butler was one of the biggest culprits in 2013. This film was based on THE true story rather than A true story - whatever the difference of the definite article might imply. The only problem was that most of the major events portrayed in the life of Cecil Gaines never happened – his mother's rape; his father's murder; his son in the Black Panthers; his son killed on active service in Vietnam. All poppycock.So David O. Russell's wonderful American Hustle had me on-side from the outset with its tongue in cheek advice at the film's beginning that 'Some of this actually happened'.Set in the 1970s, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a con man skilled at depriving the needy from cash they can ill afford to lose. Not wishing to restrict his activities to the lower socio-economic demograph, he sells forged art works to the well-heeled as a lucrative sideline. Joining him in these activities is the seductive erstwhile stripper, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), who poses as a royalty-connected member of the British aristocracy to give the operation some class. Their ill-gotten trade is broken by federal agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who then turns the couple in order to ensnare corrupt politicians on the take whom he wishes to expose and incarcerate in furtherance of his career. DiMaso's inordinate ambition is hampered only by his lack of tactical nous as he has to rely ever more on the wily Rosenfeld.American Hustle is a grand success at nearly every level.The ensemble cast appears to be without a weakness: Christian Bale, with a heavy paunch and comical comb-over, always suggests that he is far more in control then he is letting on; Amy Adams, about whom I was scathing as the demure Lois Lane in Man of Steel, is pitch perfect as the cleavage-showing Siren oozing sex appeal – her ability to separate salivating men from their dollars was all too believable; Bradley Cooper with another comical hairstyle, this time a tight-knit perm, clearly enjoyed his role as the obsessive and flawed FBI man; Jeremy Renner as the well-meaning Mayor, Carmine Polito, (collateral damage in Cooper's crusade) came across as an oily and cheesy lounge singer as a reminder of an era before professional spin doctors homogenised the political class; Jennifer Lawrence as Bale's trailer trash and manipulative wife, aware of the lien she holds over her estranged husband, gave a fantastic performance of tragic comedy. An uncredited cameo from Robert De Niro exuding septuagenarian menace was the cake icing.Direction from David O. Russell was consistently fast-paced with no lulls in its 138 minutes and without ever being confusing. The cinematography and editing were first rate.It would be nit-picking to mention that the excellent 70s soundtrack was occasionally just a little overblown.But what raises American Hustle well over the bar is its screenplay from David O. Russell and Eric Warren Singer. Humorous throughout, the film has several laugh out loud moments while also delivering both dramatic impact and thought provoking concepts. As Christian Bale becomes ever more ambivalent about what he is being forced to do, he very deftly leads the audience to share his growing but tacit realisation that sometimes an end can very much justify the means. That the film is bound to have a final twist is never in doubt. If, when it comes, it is not totally innovative or unsurprising, quite frankly – who cares? The producers of American Hustle can start hiring the limos for Oscar night.

American Hustle is built as the 2013 revival of classic Scorsese gangster pictures like Goodfellas and Casino, but without the gangsters. It has the plot twists, the plethora of pop tunes, the conniving characters, the backstabbings, the high life, the low life, the disgruntled females merciless attached to crooked husbands, the stranded children, and so on. But it's new. Fresh out of the oven. Baked with wonderful performances and tight scriptwriting. And it has characters who inhabit the story and make it their own.The movie begins in medias res, with two con men -- and one con lady -- attempting to buy out a Jersey mayor. There's a lovely opening shot of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale, almost unrecognisable) carefully and painstakingly combing over his thinning strands of hair. This scene reminded me very much of the opening of Richard Linklater's Bernie, where a plump but serene mortician played by Jack Black joyfully lectures a scarce hall of students on the process of embalming. It's a slow scene, maybe too slow to open up a movie, but we are never bored, because we are given insight to a skill that we've never seen before, or don't know much about. It's the same with this scene. I've never seen anyone cover up bald. It's always bald being uncovered; wigs and toupees accidentally being ripped off, or blown away by strong winds. The scene also informs us that Irving is a certain kind of character.After jumping to a series of flashbacks, in which the history between Irving and his long-time girlfriend Sydney (Amy Adams, almost unrecognisable without her makeup) is revealed to have blossomed over a shared love of Duke Ellington, the plot begins proper. Irving and Sydney -- now posing as a wealthy British banker named Edith -- have been arrested by Richie (Bradley Cooper, fully recognisable despite his hairdo), an ambitious FBI agent who thinks he has the wit and skill to take down corrupt congressmen and casino gangsters with flimsy, ill-conceived plans. He ropes Irving and Sydney into his little schemes, and soon has them taking on an entire network of illegal tradesmen.Caught in the middle are two people: Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), and Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Carmine is the mayor whom the trio wanted to con at the start of the movie. He becomes integral to the plot when Irving develops a friendship with him. Do I tell him that I've been conning him all along, and that my innocent little scheme might get him arrested in front of his wife and six children? Or do I stay quiet, maintain the friendship, and face my conscience alone? What he does, I will not say.Rosalyn is an interesting character. Yes, she skirts dangerously close to the Sharon Stones and Lorraine Braccos of the old Scorsese pictures, but Jennifer Lawrence is able to lift her away from them by being more grounded. Stone always seemed to operate on her own terms in Casino. She was a third wheel, functioning outside of the overall story. Here, Rosalyn is fully aware of the situation at hand. She's right smack in the middle of the story. She doesn't love Irving. Irving doesn't love her. But they both love their son, and Rosalyn doesn't want a divorce tarnishing her solid family marital integrity. But she knows that the love festering in the household is only producing toxic fumes. Where her character goes is a place best kept hidden.And then there's a mix of other secondary characters, including perhaps the best cameo I've seen (not because of the cameo itself, but because of the meaning of the cameo). All of them dip in and out of this intelligent story with impact. Why, even Richie's boss, Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.), is a lovely guy. He provides much of the movie's humour, and there is much of it. Director David O. Russell has said that his goal with American Hustle was to focus on the characters instead of the plot. Indeed, what a good decision. It's a rare moment when not a single character seems out of place. They complement each other, whether they're kissing, punching, clawing, or scratching. And they share so much chemistry that you could select any two of them at random, chuck them into an empty room, and watch them chatter till their throats went dry.I attended a screening of this movie in Mandurah, which is a lovely place. The cinema had maybe nine other patrons (weird, considering it was opening day). I'd been to Mandurah a few times before, and I watched The Counselor there. That was a poor movie, but the screening was smooth, which is more than I can say for the screening of this film. With about 15 minutes to go, the video jammed and stuttered slowly to a halt. It's the first time I've seen digital video jam. And it couldn't have happened at a worse time. The projectionist eventually rectified the problem, but I had already been sucked out of the moment. That's a pity, because American Hustle was shaping up to be one of the best movies of the year. You know what? Screw it. It still is.

American Hustle, starring Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper, is about two con artists forced into working for an FBI agent as he pushes the two into a world of New Jersey mafia. Directed by David O. Russell, the director who brought you Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, American Hustle is most probably Russell's best movie he's ever put together.American Hustle is set in the late 1970's - early 1980's, revolving around the Abscam scandal, where FBI agents and con artists would join together to take down politics for illegal cash. The casting and acting is brilliant. You couldn't really picture anybody else playing the characters that have been casted. Each actor gets their own chance to shine in the spotlight, and nobody is left out. Jennifer Lawrence blows everybody away once again - she really is a rising star in the industry with her performance as Rosalyn Rosenfeld. This might be Bradley Cooper's best movie so far as well - he really brings his A-Game for the movie as Richie DiMaso.The movie has cleavage, drugs, money, quirkiness, great actors, comedy, drama and lesbian kisses which makes for an amazing and unbeatable combination. Five losers who all think they are winners, American Hustle is up there with great movies like Goodfellas, but is definitely an original creation. Acting: 10/10 Writing: 10/10Directing: 9/10Setting: 9/10Overall Rating: 9.5

Let me say at the outset that I am at odds with the majority of critics and IMDb reviewers to date in that I thought that American Hustle was an ordinary movie. It's not that I didn't want to enjoy it. I really like Christian Bale and Amy Adams, I think that Jennifer Lawrence is destined to become the best actress of her generation and I like Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner and Robert de Niro. From a cast level, I wanted it to succeed.Perhaps my mistake was in viewing it as a drama. True, there were some humorous lines but I thought that essentially the movie aimed at the dramatic, with some violent scenes adding weight to that view. Now I find out from the Golden Globe nominations that it was a musical or comedy. (The soundtrack was good, so maybe the nominators have viewed it as a musical??)Seriously, though, I was expecting more action. I thought that the movie was too long and some scenes were far too tedious, and as a result I became bored. In addition, I didn't much care what happened to any of the seedy characters, which added to my level of apathy.I am out of step with the majority, as I have admitted, but I felt that the alternative view deserved to be aired.

this review might contain spoilers, you have been warned!!! (no big ones that would ruin your life though) :)so i decided to watch this movie last night with a friend and i had previously read some reviews before the movie started about how good this film is, so i though i might watch it and find out myself. American hustle is about 2 con artists Irving Rosenfeld (Christian bale) Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) being caught red handed and are forced to work for a wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley cooper).The film is alright and is not alright in are lot of areas, the acting is absolutely superb with Christian bales perfect role of Irving Rosenfeld and Bradley coopers Richie DiMaso. unfortunately Amy Adams didn't play as well as i thought she would in this film and Jennifer Lawrence was so out of place in this film, although with that said she did play her part quit well throughout the film as the wife to Christian bale. And Jeremy renner did a great job as the mayor.the film lacks progression (it didn't make it clear, at all) the film starts out perfectly, but about half way/ three quarters the way through you'll find yourself very confused with whats going on and lost within the plot of the story. its not until the end that it kind of makes sense with a twist that is good but is confusing because you were already lost within the story itself which kind of ruins the ending a bit to be honest. although upon a second viewing of the film I'm sure my opinion would have changed. American hustle defiantly did not live up to my expectations and i think that the film is overrated at this time with a rating of 85/100 on meta critic. i will also be very disappointed in the academy if this film wins any awards other than acting and screenplay.so with the brilliant acting and alright story the film deserves a ✭✭✭1/2

Director David O. Russell's new film American Hustle (originally titled American Bullshit) is hilarious chaos. It captures some of the same manic energy as Silver Linings Playbook, mostly through its stunning performances, but it is also scattered in its narrative and storytelling. Some people have compared the film to the style of Scorsese's crime work, like Goodfellas. I don't think it has the precision of that film but what it excels at is a very engaging character study of a criminal network of people, determined to be far more than what they are. Though it is set in the 1970s, the characterisations of its con artist characters and its dialogue quips about the state of the economy forge meaningful parallels to the post- GFC climate of America today. Beneath its sometimes messy and undisciplined narrative is a crime-comedy about the ugly side of the American Dream: greed, status and self-importance. Christian Bale features as Irving Rosenfeld, a conman who runs a laundromat but is also ripping people off with a money lending business and art forgery. He lives away from his young, crazy wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and their son and instead he finds himself in a relationship with his mistress Sydney (Amy Adams). Sydney used to be an exotic dancer but wants to be something more and uses a false English accent to scam people. When they're busted by the police they're put to work by a hyperactive FBI agent Richie (Bradley Cooper) who wants to work a big operation and bring down a corrupt politician in Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), who is intent on rebuilding Atlantic City. Yet the operation grows increasingly dangerous and elaborate, leading to the involvement of a fake Sheik (played by Michael Pena), who is actually Mexican and speaks minimal Arabic, and a dangerous gangster (Robert De Niro in a fun cameo role). One of the attractions of the overloaded but witty script by the director himself and co-writer Eric Singer is that it is never short on insight into the motives of the characters and unifying these ideas into a theme of personal ambition. As a boy, Irving would smash windows so that he would generate business for his father's windows business, showing the legacy of unethical financial viability in his life. Also significant to his character is a long opening sequence where in the present he is fat and balding and he spends a great amount of time adjusting his hair piece and combing it so that he has the appearance of a much tidier man. It is metaphorical for not just the deceptiveness of his business practices but the way other character's posture too. The dialogue characterises them as not only ambitious but conscious of the power of perception and the way people believe what they want to believe in reaching their dreams. Both the characters of Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper also strive to improve their lives too. Adams is shown briefly as a stripper, which instils a blind, single-mindedness that her scam work will provide a higher status and true happiness. She powerfully tells Irving: "You're nothing to me until you're everything". Cooper's character Richie is a loopy control freak. He is engaged and still lives at home with his mother, determining his motives for wanting to stage an elaborate heist so that he can be famous and earn a promotion. The one character who seems comfortable with themselves is Jennifer Lawrence's Rosalyn, but this is another form of blindness because she is manic, irresponsible and rash, which welcomes some delicious scenes where her unpredictable behaviour threatens to derail some of the missions. Yet there is also a poignant moment where she begs someone not to hurt Irving as he is still the father of her son. The film only needed some trimming in how it presents a lot of this information. Parts of the narrative are flabby and convoluted and the exposition rushed. The film is also too long, with several montages padding out the running time to over two hours, while a surprise end twist emerges from nowhere. David O. Russell relies dominantly on voice over in the early portions of the film to flesh out the motives and character attractions so important contextual details and exposition points, like the flashbacks to their pasts, are hastily drawn. Fortunately, when David O. Russell focuses the camera on the faces of the actors he draws career best performances from them. Both Bale and Bradley Cooper have hysterical verbal sparring contests and maximise their screen time with delicious comic energy that is so infectious and fun to watch and listen to. Their dialogue is frequently hilariously and demonstrates sharp comic timing. Under his dark aviator sunglasses, Bale also injects subtle, internalised moments of remorse when he realises he will be destroying Carmine's family. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence both bring forcefulness to their roles, generating a tornado of hysteria and comedy to some scenes that is on occasions electrifying and tense. Lawrence's presence and ability to hold a scene almost singularly is hair raising and scarily confident. Although the film doesn't have the same amount of satisfaction and sheer joy of the director's last film, it doesn't rest on its star power alone either. Each of the characters and their relationship to one another is integral to the film's thematic goal: the dissection of the American dream, where people will willingly trample one another to get ahead of the curve in troubled economic downtime and the effect this has on families. The film is at its best when these goals and desires clash head-on, spearheaded by enormously charismatic actors and a script's verbal wit that overrides its untidiness.

When your cast list comprises of Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner, and you have David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook) behind the camera, expectations are naturally going to be high. Apparently too high. Based loosely on the Abscam scandal, this period drama (set in the swinging seventies) with thriller trimmings is solid but nothing more, which, considering the talent involved, is undeniably disappointing. It's tonally uneven and the dramatic elements are subsequently diminished, whilst the sorta-scheming- and-conning plot is bizarrely underwhelming and lacking a worthy payoff. Nevertheless, Hustle scores big with some well-timed comedy, Linus Sandgren's beautiful cinematography and an absolutely cracking score; and the top shelf ensemble cast, with Amy Adams in particular, are reliably watchable (and boasting humorous disco-era makeovers to boot). There's enough here to recommend a DVD viewing, although forking out the big dollars to see this on the big screen is unnecessary.

I was invited to Special VIP screening of American Hustle as the closing movie for Dubai international Film Festival Yesterday December 14th and after watching the movie, I can see why the Festival chose this movie to be it's closing act - The movie was to say the least Amazing.The acting was top notch. It was like watching 5 wonderful actors/actresses go blow by blow to the 12th round. Amy Adams was unbelievable - she nailed the role spot on. I loved her role in "Trouble with the Curve" but wow she was amazing. Bradley Cooper was on top of his game and so natural. There were a couple of scenes were he made me crack with laughter after an intense exchange with his boss - totally unexpected in a very heavy movie with drama and twists. But the one that surprised me the most was Jennifer Lawrence - For me her role was amazing. She justified winning the Oscars last year and in this movie, I would say she topped Amy Adams even she had lesser scenes compared to bale, Cooper, and Adams.Christian Bale played his role well, but I have never been a big fan of his but he also played the ConArtist role to perfection. All in All, I loved this movie although some might find it slow at some points but the character buildup and the unexpected twist at the end made me hooked9/10

The stars seemed aligned for David O. Russell's highly anticipated American Hustle in which assembles some of Hollywood's most sought-after talent that includes Oscar-winners Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence along with Oscar-nominees Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner. He teams up with scribe Eric Singer, whose only feature writing credit is Tom Tykwer's The International, and based on the popularity of last year's Silver Linings Playbook, this was suppose to be Russell's masterpiece. Sad to report that the final product is an anti- metamorphosis of filmmaking that prohibits any consistency for the viewer to relish. What remains intact and palpable are the outstanding performances by the cast that Russell put together. All of them are dedicated to their roles, even when development and direction are lacking, and they truck through much of the narrative successfully.One of the largest areas of opportunities is the script composed by Singer and Russell. Despite scene-chewing performances from our principal actors, an absence of insight and cohesiveness, along with an irregularity of interesting dialogue plagues this once promising Oscar hopeful. In the first twenty minutes of the film's opening, I said to myself, "this is going to be my favorite film of the year." When the film ventures off into back stories and character origins, it plays like a parody of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, lacking any emotional connection. The film isn't overtly dreadful or horrendous by any stretch, just mostly disappointing. All the pieces are there, they just didn't take the time to make sure they all fit. It's confusing in tone, though very funny at times, especially coming from Cooper and Lawrence, but by the end, Russell feels he's warranted an emotional reaction from the audience when he's done anything but.Christian Bale is terrific, magnified in charisma while still keeping mostly all his ticks and mannerisms he's created for Irving in perspective. His work is also an impressive counterpoint to his other well-executed performance in Out of the Furnace. Bale proves once again that he's one of this generation's most gifted actors. Not only in the way he packs on the pounds, or rocks a comb-over better than any wannabe gangster I've encountered on the streets of Little Italy; he's the one performer that has a character that goes through an authentic evolution that's believable.As the spunky and crude wife of Irving, Jennifer Lawrence gets the biggest laughs and commands the most attention from the viewer. Better than she was in last year's overly praised turn in Silver Linings Playbook, for which she won the Oscar for Best Actress, this is a role that suits her well, both for her range as an actress and what she excels in with her fiery demeanor. I'm still a bit unsure about how old Rosalyn was suppose to be (that may be a fault of these directors thinking she's old enough to play these older women). Lawrence owns her role and has enough naughty sex-appeal and delivery to land herself an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. I'd argue if she hadn't JUST won last year, she would be a formidable threat to win. Probably a more appropriate representation for her acting arsenal.I have fallen hard for the abilities of Bradley Cooper following his role as Pat in Russell's Playbook. Subsequently, the 38-year-old actor has sought dynamic and challenging roles that you can tell he finds exciting and prolific in its nature and candor. His turn in The Place Beyond the Pines earlier this year proved that notion and in American Hustle, Cooper is simply dazzling. Delivering the best performance of the cast, Cooper nails moment after moment, infusing his strict and intense line delivery while having impeccable comedic timing. One sequence in which he imitates the great Louie C.K., who plays one of Richie's frazzled superiors, engulfed the movie theater in non-stop laughter.The actor I feel the most for is the talented and beautiful Amy Adams. If the script was more developed on a writing level, this role could have been the performance of the year. Adams is given an opportunity to enrich herself in a woman, full of layers, that prevent her from losing sight of her own identity. However, being short-changed as her character builds, leaves the audience unsatisfied with where she ends. On a pure performance level, Adams is top-notch, conveying one of her strongest turns yet. I wished more for her but ultimately was let down.David O. Russell used to be able to excite, in the way that Quentin Tarantino would when ventured off into a new realm of his imagination. His 2010 film The Fighter was his most ambitious outing and I've waited, patiently mind you, to see when he top that endeavor. I'll always award his efforts as a writer. I Heart Huckabees, Three Kings, and Silver Linings Playbook succeed mostly on the merits of his storytelling ability. American Hustle levels out a lot of the time, enabling the viewer to connect and engage the world convincingly. There are other times though, where honestly, I almost fell asleep. Even when Russell demonstrates uneven filmmaking, I've remained bound to the story. This is the first time I found myself bored, especially in scenes involving Jeremy Renner, who I adore.Read more @ AwardsCircuit.com

There is a very simple way to put this: I didn't believe it. That sums up the movie for me. Yes, there is all the razzle dazzle you can imagine. But there is nothing at the heart of this film. In Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, for example, I was an instant believer, I bought in immediately, and loved every second of the ensuing ride. Maybe I could tell from the trailers that we were going back to LaLa land territory. Schmooze, slick, and schtick. That's what this movie is. I was literally falling asleep. Because I never cared for a second, because I knew it was fake, the world never invited me in. Perhaps opening the movie with the old 'start halfway through the movie and then go back and show how they got to that point' tactic failed at bringing me believably along. I don't know, and it doesn't matter. The bottom line is I feel like I was never invited into a believable world. I guess it's just not that kind of movie. I had come to have high expectations after Russell's last two outings, which were basically celluloid cocaine. In those two, I was emotionally invested, in the reality, of how believable it was, and then everything else clicked. The snappy dialogue, the electric energy, the rockin' soundtrack, etc., all supported and enhanced the story, because there was a foundation laid. The believability comes from the characters and their relationships, set up by a story, or plot. Apparently Mr. Russell has lost the need for a plot as he is purported to have said when asked by Christian Bale whether the impromptu dialogue would change the story. While having a passion for characters and relationships is great, the story is an equally important element, and one that is lost here. This movie is thematically all over the place. There is little gravitas or gravity that keeps pulling us in its direction. We wander aimlessly through it, like a pimply teenager, awestruck at the glamour, not noticing that nothing is actually happening. This movie is all fluff. My favorite W.H. Auden quote also sums it up: "What the mass media offers is not popular art but entertainment, which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish." The same could not be said about The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. So far 2013 is a bad vintage.

The biggest puzzle for me was the fact that's its nominated for a best Comedy or Musical for the Golden globes.No way its a musical purely based on the choice of background songs , so it is it a comedy? To me there were very few funny moments.May be Christian Bales' big fat belly and Bradley Cooper's pink curlers were among the things that put a smile on my face but there were not many jokes or enough hilarious scenes to prompt it a comedy nudge. Amy Adams is very provocative .Lots of cleavage, side boobs, legs and a lot of skin. The movie often felt long and boring at points. Overall David O. Russell just hired all the actors he has worked with in the past (All really talented actors)and just let them all do their bits. Its a good movie but its not a Great movie !

The only good thing about this film is a story about ice-fishing by Louis C.K's character. The rest of the film is abominable. For a film about supposedly intelligent characters, doing supposedly intelligent things, it sucks. When the characters have to tell the audience how smart they are.... this bodes poorly.For the most part the performances were good, each of the lifeless, background-less, soulless, pieces of flesh were played well, despite the poor writing that included them in a script so full of holes that it was hard to find a piece of sensical narrative. And despite being seriously miscast, Jennifer Lawrence once again demonstrated that she can act.O. Russell exploits all of the female cast, showing frequent side boob, nipple candy and an excessive splashing of Amy Adam's apples. Excessive probably doesn't go far enough.This film is designed to distract and confuse an audience intent on glorifying an excellent cast, despite a mire of terrible writing, average directing, and non-plussed cinematography.After nearly two hours of drivel, Robert DeNiro makes an almost pointless appearance as, wait for it... a mobster. In a story that is already going nowhere, this absurd side plot is totally unnecessary. With unbelievable interactions, inane dialogue, inexplicable scams, and dreary narrative I couldn't wait for it to end after only half and hour and by this stage I was shaking my head on a regular basis.So what is all the fuss about... who knows.

I had a chance to see this at a private screening the night before it was released in Australian cinemas, I can honestly say that its an amazing crime-drama of the year!!Great performances from all the cast (including Jennifer Lawrence, who will clearly take home the Best Supporting Actress awards in the upcoming Movie Award season), the production design is great resembling the late 70's and early 80's, story is entertaining (with many moments of seriousness, humour and character) and lastly the soundtrack is amazing! Overall, it's worth seeing to get the hype! I hope it takes the Best Picture award home for David O. Russell.

The basic story in this movie is relatively straightforward...a couple of con artists (Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld and Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser) are nabbed by an ambitious F.B.I. Agent (Bradley Cooper as Richie DiMaso) who promises not to charge either of them so long as they can help him catch bigger criminals by using their skills as con artists. Irving and Sydney agree to this...Irving's wife Rosalyn (played by Jennifer Lawrence) isn't really privy to all of Irving's activities...illegal or adulterous. The start of the movie informs the viewer that "some" of the movie is based on actual events. Presumably accuracy hasn't been kept at the expense of good fun.During the movie I frequently laughed out loud as the situation went from bad to worse for Irving and Sydney, or the stupidity of Rosalyn later in the movie (Lawrence shows a talent for character based comedy in this movie). Despite this humour, the movie did strike me as being a dialogue driven piece...a wall of dialogue. It's also 138 minutes long...putting those two things together, it was quite demanding of your attention, perhaps at the expense of just providing pure entertainment. It's not exactly intellectually taxing, just demanding of your attention. Even though I don't usually watch movies again, the thought of watching this movie again due to its demanding nature made me think that I wouldn't want to do that again in a hurry. I'd have to wait a decade, maybe. The way the characters relate to each other perhaps has a 'Brooklyn' vibe to it. Maybe some people might find that taxing too.A way that the movie attempts to keep you intrigued is by making you question the motives of the various players...are Irving and Sydney using each other? What is real? Where does the con begin and end? Who's conning whom? This may provide pleasure for some as a viewing experience.Can't say that I knew how to interpret this movie...initially I missed the introduction explaining that it was partly based on a true story. Without that knowledge, I was wondering whether the movie was a comment on the Hollywood factory (e.g. Bale putting on the bat costume, pretending to be a superhero as a kind of con) or a metaphor for the American dream...in the guise of reinventing oneself to reach higher...if that is indeed the American dream...I'm Australian...I don't know these things. If the latter, maybe that has something in common with the novel "The great Gatsby", which is regarded as a classic in America and has also been turned into a movie...multiple times. Would still be inclined to think that on some level this movie is 'saying something' about the American experience, beyond merely fictionalising a true story.Another thing that struck me was how often the look of the characters reminded me of other people in movies or TV or real life. E.g. when I caught the start of the movie, with Irving elaborately doing his hair, I was reminded of Tom Cruise in "Tropic thunder", I think it was; Jeremy Renner as Carmine Polito reminded me of a young Liberace perhaps...or that kind of Teddy Boy look...if that is the right phrase; Louis C.K. as Stoddard Thorsen reminded me of Bill Bailey (the English comedian); one guy kind of reminded me of a young Michael Douglas; there's one mob guy who kind of had a George Clooney in "O brother, where art thou?" look to him (that I don't remember these character's names just reflects on how demanding of your attention this movie is); Bradley Cooper in one scene (or two) reminds me of Kevin Kline's turn in "A fish called Wanda". Sort of related, perhaps Bale channels Gandolfini as Tony Soprano in his performance at times. Jennifer Lawrence sort of reminded me of Renée Zellweger in her looks at times...but maybe that's just me?Speaking of self-referential moments...I got the feeling that a member of the crew had the same surname as the lawyer who appears in the end of the movie...something like "Tellegio"...if that is the case, perhaps it's a sort of in-joke or something? Maybe there's more of that too?There is some good 1970s music etc. in this movie but it's not quite in the same league as "Boogie nights" on that front, which was stacked with the kind of songs I love from that era."American hustle" is a true ensemble work and I suppose in a year in which no particular movie or performance has screamed "Award!" to me, the extra yards Christian Bale has put in to perform his role (putting on a lot of weight, by the looks of it...assuming it's not a fat suit), he'd be as worth a winner of a Best Actor award as anyone else. In other movies of his I've seen it occurred to me that he was often overshadowed by minor characters in star vehicles for him, like The Dark Knight (Heath Ledger's brilliant turn as the Joker) and Terminator: Salvation (Sam Worthington's character Marcus Wright was more interesting than John Connor). It's perhaps ironic that Bale may win an Oscar in a movie/character which isn't a 'star vehicle' for him. Unlike Batman, Irving is an interesting character...more filling and nutritious, acting chops wise than the caped crusader.One last thingthe endingI did wonder if the film took a morally dubious stance on the targets DiMaso was chasingi.e. not sure that I share those sentiments.

American HUSTLE (2013) **** Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner, Louis CK, Jack Huston, Michael Pena, Shea Whigham, Alessandro Nivola, Elisabeth Rohm, Robert De Niro.David O. Russell's blackly funny satire of sorts about a pair of grifters (Bale, with a combover from Hell and paunch to boast of gleeful deglam, and Adams proffering a come-and-go Brit accent) who find themselves in a bind when ambitious Fed (Cooper in a homemade perm and ego to boost) is out to make a name for himself by concocting Abscam (more-or-less) in the process. The best Martin Scorsese film Martin Scorsese never directed could best sum up this miasma of horrid clothing choices and questionable hygiene replete with a stellar soundtrack of pop AM nuggets and a root-for-the cons to win heart line. Crackerjack cast scores with hilarity including Renner as a well-meaning NJ mayor in the midst (and apparently Joe Pesci's wig rejects) and especially Lawrence as trashy but foxy smart wife of Bale's and funny man CK as Cooper's by-the-book schlump superior. Cleverly concocted script by Russell and Eric Singer has dialogue that sings and just enough gumption to make more for less.

I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. For me the trailers didn't really seem to reveal much which can be a good and bad thing depending on the type of person you are.I really enjoyed the movie and thought overall it was very well done. The movie starts out a little slow as it sets up the back story but that is to be expected. There is a flashback scene that talks about how Christian Bale's character came into the conman business and I found that somewhat uninteresting but it's a short scene so that can be forgiven. The story really picked up once they got the ball rolling with Carmine and wanting to bust higher profile people.Christian Bale's performance was very well done throughout the entire film. I totally bought his character and I have no complaints with his role at all.Amy Adams delivered another strong performance as well. Her accent was solid and I think she did a very good job in expressing her emotions as she tried to set up the entire con.I may be the only person who wasn't completely buying Bradley Cooper's character. I thought his performance was fine but didn't necessarily think that his character would do some of the stuff that he did. That put him in awkward positions having to act and express emotion that seems beyond his character.I thought Jeremy Renner did a really good job and complimented the entire cast very well. He really shined in this role and if he wasn't surrounded by such a strong cast, might have gotten more recognition for his role.Jennifer Lawrence's character really grows on you after awhile. At first she isn't in the film much but they gradually increase her screen time so that you get to see more of Rosalyn and how she lives her life. If you're a fan of Lawrence, you will absolutely love the final bedroom scene between her and Bale.The movie overall was solid and the performances are great and while I think it will be nominated for some best picture awards, I don't think it should win. I think the ladies in the film will be up for some awards but I don't see Bale or Cooper receiving any awards for the film.I think they missed the mark on this being any type of nostalgic, classic, have to watch multiple times movie. Then again, a movie only becomes that way after a long period of time. It's definitely worth a watch in the theaters and again at home if you're a fan of the actors but if someone told me that they didn't see this film I wouldn't think that they had missed out on some masterpiece like Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas, etc.

Overall, good movie. Honorable mentions to Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence. They did a fantastic job with the props as well as acting (everybody). The story itself was pretty descent up to the resolution in my opinion. I had a problem with the overall ending and thought it was unrealistic, but thats my take. I think it still is a pretty good watch for the big screen and I would not be surprised if any of the actors win academy awards for their performance. The movie was enriched with a good plot. I thought that the way that corruption is played was very realistic in that sense. The movie also had shades of grey that depict how fighting against crime isn't as black and white as many of the gangster movies have tried to do. But this movie definitely makes you feel for all of the characters at some point.

I don't usually write reviews but after seeing so many crazy positive reviews for this film, I feel that someone needs to speak the truth. If you are expecting a great crime drama in the vein of Scorsese, you will be very very disappointed. You keep hoping the movie will get better or something clever might happen in the plot. I don't want spoil anything, but there really is nothing to spoil!The plot is predictable and boring. David O. Russell, who has done some great work in the past, is trying desperately to create a "Casino", but barely even comes close to "Blow" (disclaimer: Blow is a far superior movie than this). Long story short:AVOID AVOID AVOID!

Great acting. Unpredictable outcome. Women who are stunningly beautiful in one scene and later emotionally crushed, bare-faced, and struggling for survival in the next. Bale is outstanding as is Cooper. Louis CK plays a supporting role that is nearly worth the price of admission. Sound track worth buying.Everyone is a hustler with the exception of one supporting character. Everyone is trying to find a way to survive. The will to survive is the greatest of all desires and the characters show this.My advice is that you go to the toilet before the movie as you will not want to get up and leave during the movie. There are no boring parts.In the end, everyone, including the audience, gets hustled.

Martin is getting old..but his work is still incredible. One of my fav. film of all time is Goodfellas and this movie matched it in it's pace/acting/story. Movies that stay with us weeks after watching it are very rare. I can still remember almost every scene in the 1990 flick. The running time seems very long on paper but the over 2 hour time line leaves you wanting more. The acting with Bale vs.de niro and cooper vs. liotta...can't be overstated. Bale steps out of his batman character and into a whole new persona. Amazing acting throughout and the over the top Oscar performance of Jennifer..and you have an instant classic. Is it as good as goodfellas?...no..but you'll enjoy the ride.

David O. Russell does amazing work. His movies always have incredible character development which is crucial to a good movie. The overall story was very well written, besides a couple confusing points but that's not an issue at all. The dialogue for this movie was above average, and really takes you back in time besides the few uh-oh's like the quarter in the payphone (it was 10 cents back in the 70's). As for the cinematography in the film it was superb, great angles and editing work. I give it a 9 because there are always little things that could have been done better. The acting is what truly made this film an amazing film. Let's start with Christian Bale who plays Irving Rosenfeld, a con man, and boy does he sell it! Bradley Cooper plays an FBI agent that wants nothing more than to prove his worth to the bureau, and to fall in love. Nearly every character wants to change something about themselves except for one, Jennifer Lawrence's Rosalyn Rosenfeld. She knows who she is and doesn't change who she is throughout the film. All around, amazing acting by the cast.The soundtrack was fitting for the film, especially the song Long Black Road by Electic Light Orchestra. Back to the cinematography, they did a great job recreating a set that resembles the late 1970's. Hopefully David O. Russell gets an award for this amazing film.

from http://bbman94.wix.com/brandonsmoviecornerThe power of filmmaking; that is the proved power David O. Russell seems to have over his viewers. His last two Oscar nabbing films (The Fighter & Silver Linings Playbook) combined dramatic storytelling and comedy to us through strong characters with top notch actors. American Hustle; O Russell's newest film, delivers upon every aspect of filmmaking, giving us a gripping comedy with fantastic performances. American Hustle will no doubt 'hussle' for the golden statues this year; and other nominees better beware.The movie moves at an electric pace, jumping to and from different character arcs. We are introduced to plenty of great faces, but our main heroes are daring con artists Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser. (Amy Adams) Their affair is heartbreaking and their performances are phenomenal; leaving you wanting no more or less out of their characters. They are eventually forced to team up with hot headed Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who is an out of control FBI agent trying to take his biggest case yet; bringing down powerful political figure Carmine Polito. (Jeremy Renner) DiMaso's eagerness in the act leaves all of our characters with major problems and the movie becomes a stimulating narrative with surprises around every turn. By the time you've thought you've had your fun, Jennifer Lawrence enters the scene as Rosalyn Rosenfield; Irving's pretentious, loud mouthed, b**** of a wife who adds extra tension to the story and even after all of the stuff she does you still root for her to come out okay in the end.All around American Hustle was a fantastic film, easily one of the best of the year. It delivers well on dramatic storytelling, light hearted comedy, and stellar, Oscar worthy performances. Amy Adams and Christian Bale stood out the most to me, and the supporting cast was great. American Hustle was definitely another superb ensemble film from David O. Russell and his talents; and his newest film was so good that I already want to sit down and relive it again.

Excellent acting but nothing else was good. Great cast. Christian Bale doesn't even have to speak. His facial expressions do the trick. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent. The plot dragged and was sometimes confusing. NOTHING like the preview. No action, no suspense, no gratuitous sex or violence...two hours I can't get back.The flashback is good but it ends up being part of the confusion. There are some humorous moments but some of them are shown in trailers. Definitely not a comedy. The movie is sometimes narrated which can also be annoying.

Great cast... great plot... brisk pace... just a fun movie for that two hours of reality-escape we all need from time to time!Christian Bale is mesmerizing! Amy Adams is a sexy surprise. Bradley Cooper is his usual entertaining self! Jennifer Lawrence shows some genuine emotion in her pivotal role, which suited her to a "T".The supporting cast is brilliant. There are a few surprises I won't spoil, but they all fit quite well.A very pleasant surprise was Louis CK in a clever supporting role. First time I can recall seeing him in a film. Let's hope we see more of him in the future.The plot has many, many clever twists and turns. I thoroughly enjoyed my two hours with this bunch.

I just saw this movie tonight and I found it very enjoyable. I knew it was about people playing con games, and from the one or two previews I saw, I suspected it was sort of an updated version of The Sting, which was a movie that required the viewer if he/she really wanted to enjoy it, to actually think about it. I spent most the movie trying to figure out who was hustling who and how far would each go. I knew specifically that Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, and Jennifer Lawrence were in it, but I didn't think about Christian Bale until about 15 minutes into the movie, that's how well into his role he was. He reminded me of a few other actors who with the right makeup and wardrobe sort of look like that, Paul Rudd for one. I found Jennifer Lawrence's character to be highly enjoyable. I was also very appreciative to see both Jack Jones and Anthony Zerbe having small roles in this movie as the major part of their careers took place in this era. It added a sense of understanding by the director/producers to the movie, to reach out to an audience who lived through it. A couple of drawbacks, Amy Adams hair was not 70/80's in the least except for one scene. The movie was probably about 20 minutes too long and some of the flashbacks (partial spoiler) such as the one where Bradley Cooper actually beat up his boss, could have easily been deleted. It added nothing to the movie except time. I will probably see it several times when it comes to cable. My wife and our friends also enjoyed it.

I think to truly appreciate this movie you have to had lived during the era it depicts and I think it does that very well. My wife and I are in our 50's and found the movie quite realistic to that time They have made the scenes very authentic as well as the dress, mannerisms of the characters, and the music. It really took us back to our younger days. The ability to weave a little comedy in a movie such as this is what makes it so good. The ending was a true surprise and I never saw it coming. My wife loved it as well and we are even contemplating buying it on DVD when it comes out. A great film. Don't pass this one by. You wont be disappointed!

Featuring the main actors from David O. Russell's most recent successes, "American Hustle" is not as good as either "The Fighter," or "Silver Linings Playbook;" however, the actors make it worth it.The movie starts slowly, taking its time to get real interesting. I personally am not a fan of narrations in movies, and that collaborated to the slow pace. The sequence where we learn about Bale's relationship with Adams has high points, but is mostly not captivating.But, as said before, the actors carry the complex and slow built up plot. All four main actors are amazing, creating characters so deep that I wasn't sure who I was rooting for. Special nod to Jennifer Lawrence, who might be winning her second Oscar at the young age of 23 come February.The movie was great at hovering the line between dark comedy and drama like few movies can; I was impressed.O. Russell's directing was good, but not as impressive as in "Silver Linings Playbook." The opening scene, the one in the dry cleaners, and the one in the dance club are highlights.The music was at times spot on, but I feel like it could have been so much more, since the movie features the late 70's/early 80's.

Frankly, the movie itself does not live up to its hype. I never was fully engaged with any character even though it takes more than enough time and delivers a tedious and often painstaking pace. Honestly, it felt to me like the film dragged and that the ending would never arrive. Even though not fully engaged and not empathetic towards any character depicted, there is enough style that I somehow cared about how the story ended. Every scene seemed to me like an exercise in an acting class. It feels like a professor took a group of talented actors and gave them this over-the-top 1970's assignment. Everyone gets an "A" because they are that good but it barely felt like a coherent film to me. It's like their assignment included constant references to try and deliver a "Goodfellas" type tone without having a script to back it up. The events of the conclusion were so easy to spot that I'm sure most everyone will see it coming a mile away. Overall, interesting but there is far less substance than I was expecting. I have to say this was a let down.

I saw "American Hustle", starring Christian Bale-Batman in the Dark Knight movies, Newsies; Jennifer Lawrence-Katniss in the Hunger Games movies, Silver Linings Playbook; Bradley Cooper-Silver Linings Playbook, the Hangover Movies; Amy Adams-Lois Lane in Man of Steel, Enchanted and Jeremy Renner-Hawkeye in The Avengers-2012, 28 Weeks Later.This movie is based on a real situation that happened in the late 1970's. The movie starts with Christian fixing his hair. He is overweight-I heard that he gained 40 to 50 pounds for the role-and he is balding, with longer hair on the sides of his head, which is what he is combing over to cover the bald spot-he is even using glue to keep it in place. Believe me, it is not a flattering scene but it does let you know a little about his character. He is a con artist. Amy is his partner and she uses a fake British accent to fool their 'marks'. Bradley plays an FBI agent that busts them and then decides to use them to get bigger fish. Jennifer plays Christian's loopy wife; she tricked Christian into marrying her and adopting her son, but she never leaves the house. She doesn't seem too bright, either but Christian stays because he loves the boy. Jeremy plays the mayor of New Jersey, the bigger fish of the FBI's take-down operation. There is a lot of good 1970's music, but FYI, Led Zeppelin's 'Good Times Bad Times' is not in the movie-it is used in some of the trailers. There is also a good cameo for a mob boss that shows up. It's rated "R" for language, violence and sexual content-no actual nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 18 minutes. I would probably buy this on DVD.

Set in New Jersey, American Hustle follows con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) along with his partner and lover Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who get caught in one of their schemes by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). However, instead of imprisonment, DiMaso convinces the two to pull off their biggest heist yet on political operator Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). Rosenfield agrees, while also trying to keep his eccentric wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) under control and unable to blow their cover.Under the fabulous direction of David O.Russell, American Hustle looks and feels like a 70s con/mob film through and through. Everything from the set pieces, the costumes, and even the soundtrack completely brings you out of the present and thrown into the world being portrayed on screen. The story itself doesn't exactly bring anything new to the table as far as con artist sub genre, but everything else about it sets apart from any other film you'll see this year. We are given a group of characters that each have their own story to tell in the way they are presented to us. Even if a person viewing the film isn't exactly sold by the story, it's the characters that really help move the film along.Along with the engaging characters, we have an outstanding cast that help bring them to life. Christian Bale does a good job as the lead as the slimy con man who thinks he's on the top of the world. Amy Adams plays his partner and lover and portrays the seductive role with ease. However, our two other leads give the best performances of the film. Bradley Cooper provides a lot of the comic relief in the film as the cop who coaxes the two con artists into the situation. He plays the cocky and at times crazy character who tries to use his charm to get what he wants, and Cooper nails it. Also providing comic relief is Jennifer Lawrence. At 22-years-old she's playing a role that requires her to act so much older than she actually is. As the wife of Bale's character, she plays the snooping and eccentric character so perfectly and just over-the- top enough to really believe it. She once again proves that she is the most talented young actress of her generation.American Hustle is an excellent addition to the sub genre with excellent direction and a solid cast that help bring the story and setting to life and completely take you into the world you're watching portrayed. My Rating: 9/10

First of all let me start out by saying Catching Fire was boring as hell.American Hustle is already nominated for 7 golden globes. That should be reason enough to see this movie, but if you need extra persuasion here it is. GO SEE THIS MOVIE.I know your reading this hoping to figure out if you should go see this movie in theaters and if that $10 is spent wisely alongside the time and effort. Well it is.You don't need any story plots or extra details because that would mean going into the movie knowing. You don't need it.Just go. Also go to my website www.uncoveringsuperman.com

I went into this movie with the highest of expectations simply because I did these type of gangster, conman, dramatic type of movies. However, about 20 minutes in I was waiting and waiting for that big climax, the first killing, the twist, etc etc. However, I was left empty and unfulfilled throughout the entire movie. This movie was advertised and promo'd as a serious crime, corrupt drama and it came across as a comedy moreso than a drama. It was difficult to take Bale and Cooper seriously, and the only time I really felt connected to the movie that I thought I was going to see was when Deniro hit the screen. He gave the movie a little bit of credibility, however it was short lived. The story is fictional enough, and it kept somewhat interested, however it was too long and should have been shaven back a good 20-30 minutes. It was difficult to follow Bale's character because you could barely understand a thing he's saying. I understand that's his character, however it doesn't add any clarity to the story. It just makes it that much more confusing to understand.The acting was nothing to write home about. I enjoyed Lawrence's performance, however I enjoyed her comedy and humor, and that was just disappointing as I didn't want to laugh in this movie. I wanted to take it seriously and I wanted to see more crime, killing and drama. It didn't deliver this unfortunately.Anyways, if you go to see this movie, just don't expect to see a top quality, Scorcese type of crime / drama, because this isn't it. It's a weak attempt at trying to copy movies such as Goodfellas, The Town, Italian Job and Oceans Eleven. It does have a sweet sound track, but that's not enough to save this one.

At first I thought I'd give this movie 8*, but when I thought about it - this movie was not anything special. It had great actors who delivered. I loved the humor in the movie and all that. However, I was getting bored while watching it as some scenes, moments in the movie were too extended. 2:09 for this movie?.. I feel this movie could have easily been squeezed into 1:45-2:00. The ending was somewhat predictable. I am not saying I knew how they are going to end it, but I pretty much called it of how it is going to end. This movie reminded me of some other movies I've recently watched, where suddenly there is this crazy plan that catches everyone off guard, including the viewer. I wish they went for something different at the end.

Acting, Story line, directing. Just when you think you know what is happening, you get confused. It's a movie that makes you think. I have to re-watch the movie as I feel like I missed a few things just having to think, thinking I had it figured out.Great cast of characters, everything is in mesh. Very enjoyable movie with twists and turns. B. Cooper actually hits his mark. Loius CK is brilliant, and the cameo of a certain character really makes the movie that more enjoyable as you are not expecting to see what you're about to see. over all, I'd go watch the movie again just to make sure I didn't miss anything.

I like crime movies in general and the cast looks great.So I went in with high expectations. In my opinion, the best part of the movie is its music, beautiful and blending well with the situations. However, writing is probably the worst part, and directing is not much better. The story is cliché, the story-telling is confusing. The acting is good as expected, but the characters are too single-faced and predictable. So sometimes I found myself sitting there thinking "that's good acting of so and so". But a good movie should make you forget there is acting at all and completely live in the story for two hours. Unfortunately, it's a disappointment overall.

An actor's movie if there ever was one, a part-true, part-fictionalized account of scandal, deception, manipulation, and justice all set during the glitzy 1970s, with colorful characters including a slick con artist, his seductive mistress and partner in crime, a firebrand federal agent, a self-righteous mayor, and the con man's wild card wife all thrown into the mix, all connected in one way or another to the behind-the-scenes greed and machinations of American politics. A smörgåsbord of pure acting ability, interesting characters, effective twists, brilliant dialogue that recalls Tarantino, and plenty of tense, heated exchanges and character interactions that test the limits of each actor's ability. A bit on the long side, and not always easy to follow, but darkly humorous and always engaging, though the plot caves in at the end and seems much too formulaic for a film that is anything but conventional. It's difficult to identify a true standout because every actor (Bale, Cooper, Adams, Renner, Lawrence, et al) is sensational across the board. One of director Russell's most memorable films to date, who shoehorns in major actors from two of his previous works, and yet still somehow finds a way for all of them to shine. ***

Greetings again from the darkness. Over the years, there have been some very entertaining con artist films, and they range from outright comedy (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) to cheeky (The Sting) to dramatic (The Grifters). My personal favorite is David Mamet's House of Games, a very quiet and subtle look at the con. The stylistic opposite of Mamet's gem is the latest from director David O Russell. It's like comparing Duke Ellington to Donna Summer - both of which are featured on this soundtrack.For the past few months, I have said that this film's trailer is one of the best I have ever seen. The energy and visuals were enthralling and have had me anxiously awaiting a chance to see the film. So please understand when I say that the movie does not quite match the expectations, it's not really a criticism ... more of a tip of the cap to the marketing efforts. This is one showy, flamboyant, often frenetic wild ride that is also a bit messy and sometimes even clunky.Hair, clothes, cars, music ... the best and worst of the 1970's ... are on full display. Christian Bale sets a new standard for worst (and most elaborate and labor-intensive) comb-over in film history. Bradley Cooper's perm wins the contest for tightest curls over Emma Thompson in Saving Mr Banks. Jeremy Renner's pompadour would make any rockabilly performer envious. And let's not forget the women. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence provide a steady stream of flowing and floppy locks that would keep any shampoo or blow dryer company in business. The soundtrack, usually coordinated to story events, also includes Steely Dan, Jeff Lynne, Elton John and many others.Director Russell's most recent films include The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. He is obviously infatuated with odd characters who are slightly off from society. What better topic than con artists so desperate to be liked that they spend all effort trying to rip off the gullible types? Now mix that trait with the ambitious persona of Bradley Cooper's FBI Agent and the US Attorney played by Alessandro Nivola, and you have a collision of worlds that results in a fictionalized account of the ABSCAM events of the late 70's and early 80's. I say fictionalized because the film starts with a banner that states "Some of this actually happened". What did or what didn't really doesn't matter here.Who is playing whom? What is real and what is part of the con? Those are the questions that we as viewers ask, and oddly enough, these are the same questions the key characters ask. If they can't tell, we certainly have no chance.This one is all about the characters. Mr. Bale (40 lbs heavier) bears no resemblance to Batman. He embodies the falsely confident con man. Cooper is a bit over-hyped in his role, while Adams is at her best in a role that is the film's most diverse. The real explosion comes every time Jennifer Lawrence is on screen. Not only do things blow up in her kitchen, but she jolts the film in each of her scenes. Some may be tired of Ms. Lawrence's recent success, but as a film lover, I put her screen presence very near that of Marilyn Monroe. She grabs our attention and holds it. That's talent that very few possess.Supporting work that should be noted includes Louis CK as Cooper's reluctant supervisor, Michael Pena as a fake sheik (can they do that?), Jack Huston and Shea Whigaham (both from Boardwalk Empire), and the great and rarely seen Anthony Zerbe (one of the all time TV villains). There is also a high profile cameo that seems right in line with Russell's adoration of Scorcese's Goodfellas.If you are looking for a film to analyze and dissect, you will be most disappointed in this one. If you are looking for a fun, wildly visual and very entertaining retro film, this one should fit the bill. Just keep your hand on your wallet and don't be one of the suckers.

A movie about Hustling, with a mix of politics. Without giving away much of the story I found the movie grabs the viewer and leaves the mark wanting more or experiencing what will happen next. What makes American Hustle work is the characters. Christine Bale has another strong performance. Bale's character is smart and knows the art of the con. Tell them no which creates anticipation. There is what the mark wants to believe compared to what is actually is. Knowing the mark's intentions of what they actually want is the art. What surprised me with the story is the human empathy side of Bale's character. Amy Adams' character is the art of seduction. Amy stirs desire and makes an illusion of being sot after, unattainable, but comforting. Bradly Cooper is a rookie F B I agent who knows everything, has no experience, and does not listen to his supervisor. The minor characters are Jeremy Renner doing the best for New Jersey and and De Niro as a gangster who can see through any con. The movie's characters mixed into the art of the hustle create one entertaining movie. Eight out of ten.

First, the IMDb synopsis describes Amy Adams as the "British" partner. She does not play a Brit. She poses as British.The movie, contrary to many reviews, is not frothy, or light or even a comedy. It is a drama that has comedic elements. It is a good show, not a great movie. Also, all the Jennifer Lawrence accolades are surprising when, in fact the most impressive performances belong to Christine Bale and Amy Adams. The press have a love affair with Lawrence which may be understandable considering she gives a great uncanned interview and she is talented. Watching her is always entertaining, but not surprising. I have only seen her in Silver Linings and in American Hustle. Basically it's the same character and both close to who she appears to be (without the neuroses and hysteria). She is charismatic and real always. But not surprising. Amy Adams on the other hand is amazing. She seems to create iconic characters that bear no resemblance to each other and yet they are entertaining, real and riveting. Yet she hasn't gotten the great press or the big accolades.Contrary to reviews saying that Lawrence blows everyone away, NOT SO. It is Bale who blew me away. This Welsh man completely embodies a Bronx con man with such humanity you can't help but love him. And, this is the first role I've seen him where I found him wildly attractive, despite his comb over and pot belly. His character could have been a repulsive unsympathetic pig, but instead, he is the one with whom we identify and the heart of the picture. His accent is perfect and he doesn't fall into the trap of lots of actors portraying New Yorkers--going over the top. He is restrained in that area. His mannerisms are right on and his heart is on his sleeve which may, partially, be credited to the script, but he embodies that character brilliantly. When he is on the screen, he is the one I am watching.Bradely Cooper, an excellent actor, did not fair as well. Again, he may have had a tougher job bringing out the humanity of the character, but that is the job of the actor. And he could have done it better. I did not care about his character, and I should have. Lawrence has the easiest role. A real character, funny in a crazy neurotic way. She has the flashy, comic-relief role that always gets noticed. And she plays it well. But again, it wasn't sympathetic and it should have been. But she is charismatic and entertaining to watch.I had a similar reaction toward American Hustle (AH) as I did to Silver Linings Playbook (SLP)--okay, watchable, but what's all the hype about? AH is a far better film. SLP was a smaller, quirkier film with a script that seemed contrived. But AH suffers from some of the same problems, but with a much better script, and great twists to keep the audience intrigued. However, it didn't quite fly. It didn't breathe and take flight. In a way AH is bogged down by the very thing that makes movies great: characters. Unfortunately, some of the character idiosyncracies were forced. For instance, the come over worked perfectly for the Bale character. In his youth Irving protects his father by "creating" business for him in a less than honest way; as an adult he protects himself in a desperate, self-justifying way: feeling a continuing vulnerability, Irving does what it takes to overcome (over comb) it and fit in--his comb over is a metaphor for his vulnerability and for his misdirected determination to "overcome" even if it requires dishonesty. Unfortunately, the director uses the same "hair" obsession to much less success for the Cooper character. In that case it just seems contrived. It provides a cheap laugh, but otherwise it's a self-conscious disconnected device.All in all, it was an interesting piece of fictionalized history, even illuminating and certainly ironic (the good/bad guys get caught but the real bad guys go untouched) with some good characters/performances and great performances by Bale and Adams.

The movie wasn't good. It was long, boring and the plot barely kept me awake. This is coming from a man that loves almost every movie he sees. Should have cut the movie to a little bit shorter with more of a 'bang' at the end. The 'bang' at the end was tiny. This has nothing to do with the actors. The actors did a great job portraying their roles! It was fun to see the main actors be in different roles for a change. Bummer to hear that Christian Bale got a herniated disk in his back because he gained so much weight and had terrible posture. I was upset that it was a bust. The marketing that the company did for the movie was over the top. It looks pretty dang good from what I saw on TV. I don't know how this movie could be rated so high on here and rotten tomatoes. Still a little upset.

Director David O. Russell's new film, American Hustle, may not be Russell's best film, but he has clearly hit a stride in his career. American Hustle tells the inspired by a true story of a group of con artists in the late Seventies, coerced by the FBI to help them bring down crooked politicians. Like most films like these, the plot is labyrinthine, often hard to keep up with, and thusly has a few plot holes for such reasons. Here's the thing, American Hustle is a well made, well acted film with some of Russell's trademark quirkiness creating laughs here and there, but the characters never become likable. These characters are all fairly deplorable and I'd be hard pressed to find anyone who'd honestly enjoy spending time with these people. With that said, Russell is at the top of his game in his shot design, further expanding upon the visual ideas of The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook with this outing, then there are the performances. While Amy Adams' constant slipping in-and-out of her faux British accent kind of grinded on me after a while, Christian Bale with his beer gut and combover is phenomenal, and Jeremy Renner shines in each scene he is in as a New Jersey Mayor. As a fan of filmmaking and good acting, I enjoyed American Hustle, but this is not a film that I will find myself revisiting due to the lack of emotional connection with anyone in this film. Plus, if you're going to make a film about con artists, as the filmmakers you have to be able to con the audience and deceive us with every twist and turn, and unfortunately this film did not, with most major surprises seen on the horizon at least two or three scenes before revealed. If you really want to see a con artist film that literally cons the audience, watch The Sting.I give American Hustle an 8 out of 10!

what you have is one of the best performances of the recent times by the "entire" cast (not just couple of them). Christian Bale is the master of makeover and is so much into character and at times hard to believe that the same guy played the famous caped crusader. Amy Adams was fabulous in "The Master" and is completely convincing as a conniving ruthless seductress. Jennifer Lawrence is adorable, playing that crazy, eccentric and loud mouthed wife - she might be the best female actor to have happened in last few years and next decade or so belongs to her. Bradley Cooper is great with his funny hair playing that over-zealous fed who wants to shake the whole system. I might be stretching it, but Renner has that aura of Joe Pesci. I absolutely loved everyone in the movie. For me the story/plot was not the most original of all. If you have seen many of these, you know how it is going to end and who is gonna win. Sometimes, the predictable trying too hard with the cover of unpredictability (and all those twists and turns) can be off-putting. But, script is extremely tight and gripping. The chemistry between all the characters is almost natural. The dialogues are well thought and are timely hilarious. The camera and lighting, the costumes, hair-dos all take you to that 70-80s era. In all, a great job!

Never trust a movie that's having a better time than you are When New York con man Irving Rosenfeld meets his lady luck, an English accent faking Sydney Prosser, their business-honeymoon provides more excitement and pleasure for the characters than the first act of David O. Russell's GOOFELLAS clone American HUSTLE allows the audience to be part of: What's really needed is that special someone to shake things up Let's first point out that, like the work of newspaper caricature artists, two leading men can be transformed into average, goofy looking slobs Christian Bale's Irving resembles a balding Sea Lion while Bradley Cooper's shifty FBI agent Richie DeMaso is a pointy gnu with an extremely bad perm And both dolts are extremely in love with Sydney Meanwhile, unlike the uglified males, Amy Adams looks better than ever.After setting up and taking down Irving and Sydney's scams, ranging from fake art to business loans, the main plot involves Cooper's Richie making a deal: the couple have to turn in four lucrative con artists in order to regain freedom This labored sting involves a bogus sheik, an idealist politician and a dangerous mobster played by a surprise guest, who not so surprisingly wields the most intense scene that ends much too quickly.The 1970's are brought to life in all the glorious polyester by SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK director Russell, zooming cameras in the Martin Scorsese fashion as classic rock provides an ongoing soundtrack to the tantrums and heartaches, which often distract from the pivotal cons being dealt in a whirlwind pace.And while every flashy deck needs a wild card, here it's Jennifer Lawrence as the young and shallow, conniving and deliberately annoying Rosalyn, Irving's trophy wife who, like Sharon Stone's manipulative gold-digger from CASINO, is a bad luck charm thwarting the hard work earned by the real players. What's more tragic is she eventually pushes Adams who had genuine femme fatale potential into a somewhat benign backseat.To give away the twists would be a crime, and to fill in the clues a sin, but ultimately HUSTLE unveils who we were subliminally rooting for and against It's too bad we didn't have more reason to love and hate these people along the way Although, for better or worse, they do take us for a ride.

I want to start off with this... I love this movie. Why? It's true what so many are saying, it's just incredibly entertaining and just so, so much fun! That's really what it comes down to. The only other O Russell films I've seen are The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. The former I thought was decent if totally formulaic, and the latter I thought was fantastic although still somewhat formulaic. Russell shows a different kind of energy here that I hadn't seen from him in those two films, and he shows that he has a more distinct vision than I would have imagined. The plot here really is messy and sometimes hard to follow, but what keeps it endlessly intriguing is the cast and many single individual scenes that manage to work completely on their own. This shouldn't be how a film functions, and it's a surprise the film is as great as it is because it really is all over the place sometimes. But it all works.There are many great performances here, but the single best is Bradley Cooper. Who would have thought two years ago that the Hangover jerk- looking guy could actually act, but wait, that he could actually have an incredibly likable screen presence and steal a film from so many of his co-stars! That's what he does. He releases a kind of energy here that he didn't reach in Playbook and steals away most of his scenes. The other comparable to Cooper is Lawrence, who's also having a blast with all of this. It's like someone let these two come up with their own things and weren't given rules to go by. There's a spontaneity to them and the whole film really, and it pays off tremendously. They both benefit from having some of the funniest material. Bale is great, as expected, but for me, Amy Adams resonated more. In the past, she'd always been hit-or- miss for me, but after last year's wonderful work in The Master and now this, she's becoming someone I'm actually liking a lot. Jeremy Renner has much less screen time than the other four, but he nails the role in his limited screen time. In short, these five make up the strongest ensemble of 2013, unlikely to be challenged by any other cast. That's pretty much what the film's success comes down to. Its cast (and I didn't even mention all of the other great supporting turns) makes this a roaring great time. It may not have the emotion or gravitas that films like 12 Years A Slave or Gravity have, but it might just be better as a more accessible movie-going experience.

I was really excited to seeing this film so I went to watch it on its premiere. Knowing David O. Russell's way of directing I knew I'd end up liking it but not quite exactly. The best thing about this movie were the characters, every single one had their own moment to shine. The acting was superb and the humor was perfect. The only thing that bothered me was how messy the plot seemed most of the time and it was a little bit hard to follow. Also the movie was dragged on too long, his previous works are "long" but this one was the only one were it felt too long. The soundtrack was great and the cinematography as well, it had some random moments but the acting made up for it. Every actor here was just superb, they all deserve their nominations and awards. Of course I have to mention how great Jennifer Lawrence was like AMAZING all the way, the comic relief of the movie. But EVERY SINGLE actor was just amazing, their characters are THE reason to watch this movie.As you can see I mention mostly how great the characters/acting was and that's just mainly it. They had so much heart and their stories didn't bore. David O. Russell captures their lives so well and so entertainingly dazzling it's just intriguing. The plot, like I said, was messy at points but the movie it's just a wild ride with great people and sublime moments.

"Everyone hustles to survive," and that's the picture American Hustle's '70's quintessentially paints for the culture and mentality of America. Our very economic system encourages for loops to be taken as long as you secure those wads of cash, and, in the end, the easiest targets will receive the boot into a jail cell rather than the powerful and resourceful (the crooked and corrupt bankers and politicians who deserve to share a moniker with other criminals). Anyways, the whole concept is devoid of any sense of morality, and that essentially grooms Irving Rosenfeld (played by Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (played by Amy Adams) for the big leagues of scamming and reaping the riches. However, once they're finally caught by an FBI agent- Richie DiMaso (played by Bradley Cooper)- their sole responsibility is to catch a bunch of dirty politicians red-handed in bribery, and they're in charge of constructing the whole procedure. There's no doubt that American Hustle gives off that "Goodfellas" vibe and is generally influenced by Scorsese's masterful work, but it also decides to incorporate even further playfulness. David O. Russell's signature style of directing in which he implements humor into the tensest or most dramatic of scenes returns. All throughout, I found myself confused if certain scenes were meant to be slightly funny or fully serious. Though I chuckled during some mainly parlous scenes that played out in a more outlandish manner (which instituted that element of humor), the majority of the theater room sat in silence. What I'm trying to say is that it's an incredibly fun ride. First of all- and, in my opinion, most importantly- we witness some of the most brilliant, captivating, and intricate performances of this year from the likes of Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jeremy Renner- an all-star cast! Christian Bale, most evidently, remarkably strays from a recognizable appearance and instead sports an atrocious, but equally comical, haircut, an actual beer belly, and a Jersey accent. In sum, the guy transforms like no other. Moreover, all of these characters are granted their time to shine, and they all truly stand out with their own distinctive personalities. Russell means to emphasize this: it's all about the characters who glow with exuberance and complicacy. An abundance of fun is had by placing some of the most vibrant individuals into a complex predicament and then simply watching how they attempt to dig themselves out of such an extensive hole. Not only are we joyful at the sight of an obviously talented cast- not one stealing another's thunder- but we're also surprised by some brilliant- brilliant- cameos. The flamboyancy of these characters greatly stem from a terrific script that provides us with clever and hilarious dialogue. See, this cinematic wonder is so damn quotable as every other line carries amusement and farcicality with it. In addition, the intriguing narrative is serviced by an outstanding soundtrack, recalling the greatest '70's tunes (those violins are just daunting in 10538 overture- amazing track, by the way). With that being said, the plot becomes a little confusing at times, especially at the beginning. The whole plan is so elaborate that the structure and details within moderately threw me off. One has to possess a somewhat clear idea of how the entire financial scamming business works in order to completely understand the more prominent events. A considerable amount of the confusion is thankfully removed as the story progresses and we hear Bale's explanative narration over the wild occurrences. Furthermore, the picture commences with noticeably slow pacing as we take the time to familiarize ourselves with the characters and their backgrounds. It definitely reminded me of Casino's fairly sluggish opening in which De Niro explains the multiple processes and conveys the nature of the crime-riddled environment we're about to be cast down into. Finally, when the scheme is set into motion, that's when the storyline picks up as we see the countless characteristics of these peculiar individuals make their mark. Overall, American Hustle is an exceptional piece of cinema that delivers on what it promises. Normally, a predominantly nonviolent crime tale would feel strange and unfulfilling, but Russell knows exactly what he's doing here. With the help of superb and rich performances from A-list actors, this crime drama feels fun, suspenseful, risible, and impeccably crafted (considering the sublime costumes and the impressively effective presentation of the 70's).

Twists and turns. That pitches American Hustle better than its own plot. David O. Russell's latest is one that can benefit from going in blind, even if the trailers revealed next to nothing on what it's actually about (hallelujah). Featuring damn-near everyone from O. Russell's last two films, American Hustle definitely treads the too-much-for-its-own-good line, yet it still manages to come out on top.For those who crave pre-viewing details, American Hustle deals with conning. A couple characters make a living out of conning people, who then get caught and forced to con others who are, themselves, cons. You could probably make a drinking game out of describing this movie's plot. Even if the premise doesn't peak your interest, O. Russell has more than a few ways to fixate you. The movie opens with a small, humorous jab at the oft-used "this actually happened" title card in movies. Follow that up with a priceless hair scene and we have the start to a movie that builds and builds, all while immersing you. Though there are many characters, Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper are the real tri-force here. Bale gets completely invested in his character (once again) and is often tough to see beyond the hair, glasses, belly fat and other make-up. Adams dominates nearly every scene she's in, bringing a presence that's both vigorous and electrifying. As for Cooper, much like his Silver Linings Playbook performance, there's a constant sense of a man with too many nerves in certain areas, but they rarely snap apart. There's so much praise and discussion to go around for the entire cast, that you could write a review simply on that. Even comedian Louis C.K. gets some classic moments in a role perfect for his dry style of humor.Just as important (if not more so) is the directing style, which has a Scorsese-like feel in that it's flamboyant, but not overbearing (save The Departed). The entire time there's a constant question of what's real and what's fake. Aside from a couple deliberate points, each scene keeps you wondering what's thin as skin and what's thick as bone for each character. Even those who aren't actual cons might just be putting up a little facade of their own. Consistent second-guessing, first-rate performances and a lively directing style all lend very necessary contributions. American Hustle is one of those movies that keeps on giving. It hits you like a whirlwind with every scene on your initial viewing. Come back again and it's guaranteed to make you notice and appreciate a little bit more. With a bravado like this, David O. Russell is certainly doing well to solidify his place amongst other greats, such as Scorsese and the Coen Brothers.

American Hustle is a Great Film. What a Great Film with superb performances all around. It was funny, serious and everything you want from David O' Russell. There was a Great cameo by DeNiro and he and Bale played beautifully off one another. Speaking of Bale, he was Flawless I loved his Dynamic with Amy Adams who should get a Oscar Nom for this and Jennifer Lawrence who was fabulous in her small role. I also loved Bradley Cooper he took his role and really sunk his teeth into it and again Bale and he were fabulous together. I can't say enough good about this film.A def must see. Bale deserves an Oscar nomination for the film as well, in fact I would give him the Oscar.

American Hustle is a stunning epic with a repeat cast from the Silver Linings Playbook, is perfectly paced film that lets the viewer in on just enough of the joke to feel smart enough to be engrossed, but not so much that anyone could say "I saw that coming." While both a dramatic tour de force and a comedic parody, this film has all the grip of Godfather I or II which ever you favor. This stellar cast delivers A Sorkin-like plot with the comedic aplomb of an Apatow spoof, and left me wanting more. The genius of the script is that one can be empathizing with anyone of the main characters even while they have competing and opposites agenda.

With American Hustle David Russell counters F. Scott Fitzgerald's claim that in America there are no second acts. His major characters live out the American Dream that people can reinvent themselves, sometimes over and over, to the point that deceiving others can lead to their self-deception. This fictionalized version of the Abscam take-down reveals a world of Sammy Glicks. This is America as hustler.The opening scene establishes the theme of deceptive appearance. Irving Rosenfeld (an himself transformed Christian Bale) laboriously engineers a pathetic combover. After this ridiculous introduction he grows into a very sympathetic character. Despite the range of his criminal enterprises, he cares for his adopted son, he's smart enough to fall for the smart con-woman Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) and he has the conscience to try to save his new friend, the mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). The film redefines Irving from ridiculous to admirable — within the parameters of self-serving fraud. Even at his worst — preying on the desperate by commanding a five grand fee for the futile attempt to secure them a much larger loan — he remains more sympathetic than the greed-driven and impersonal banks of America.Irving is also a more appealing character than the federal agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), a working class loser with violent tendencies who goes manic trying to advance his career. Where Irving and Sydney remember who they are DiMaso fools himself through the schemes and deceptions he tries to command. His vanity and ambition are baser than Irving's and Sydney's desire to rise out of their limited origins. As Irving says, "Did you ever have to find a way to survive and you knew your choices were bad, but you had to survive?" We're satisfied that the lovers win and DiMaso loses. Irving and Sydney meet and first connect over their shared love of a blues song, but one without words, Ellington's Jeep's Blues. In the con's world words are less reliable than music.DiMaso's vanity and superficiality (as in his curling his hair) aligns with Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Where Irving and Sydney remake themselves "from the feet up," i.e., intensely and completely, Rosalyn only remakes her image. She spends all her time doing her hair and her nails and frying under the sunlamp. At the end she achieves what she had refused — divorcing Irving — and settles in with a supposedly more devoted lover, the second-line mafiosa. At the end Irving and Sydney rewrite themselves again, as a couple, as parents of Rosalyn's son, and professionally legitimated as owners of — an art gallery, where the themes of crooked dealing, exploitation and the sale of an image over reality are likely to be renewed.Like the intriguing characters in their various stings, Mayor Polito has made a political career out of hustling -- albeit for his constituents. The FBI here is itself implicated in the crooked hustle when DiMaso coerces our two chief cons into working for him, to con for the government. In the FBI there is one solid man of conscience and principle, played by the inveterate schnook Louis CK, when all his colleagues and superiors espouse the con. In an America that is all hustle, it is still possible for an honest person to survive — and for hustlers to define their own integrity. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.

In this exaggerated, over the top world the human drive is to get one over and out hustle the fellow man. The hustle is the theme of life in this 1970s New York City world. The convoluted plot was fun to follow, seeing where it meanders with tensions intensifying ultimately crescendo-ing into chaotic surprises. The chaos of the film may reflect the chaos the characters are feeling as the "hustle" ignites and explodes into danger. A boring beginning with not the most thrilling characters ever created evolves into a more fun tricky plot. In order to preserve the mystery of the hustle we must be kept at a distance from some of the characters. We are never quite able to enter some of their heads until the very end, so throughout the movie the characters are vague and lack substance in our eyes. This distancing makes connecting with them difficult. So you ultimately don't really care too much about these characters.American Hustle glorifies its actors and actresses. The overly exalted Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are showcased in many scenes strutting their stuff with haughty confidence and moxy in slow motion. These are all good actors and I'd like to see them brought into more of a reality instead of put on pedestals and thrust down our throats. Overall each of the actors had their moments and at other times they were over the top. American Hustle can be watched for a fun plot that makes you think during the viewing about the motivations of the characters and who is trying to hustle who. And afterwards the thinking continues as you digest and connect the dots to the puzzle that was just witnessed.

There are a quartet of excellent performances to be found in this fast and loose re-telling of what led to the famous ABSCAM sting involving congressman and corrupt Jersey pols back in the 80s but under the guidance of David O Russell's feverish, erratic direction the film implodes into improbable silliness before its pat happily ever after finish.Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale)is a career con artist with a chain of dry cleaning stores (how appropriate) and a phony investment business that scams desperate investors with the promise of a heavy return. He meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) a Jersey stripper who can produce a fetching English accent and the business takes off as well as their intimate relationship. When she gets busted by a hyper intense FBI agent Richie DiMaso ( Bradley Cooper) they agree to working a sting that starts out small but mushrooms big time when the DC pols develop a taste for some illicit green waved in front of them. Mob involvement raises the stakes.Leading man Bale is outstanding as the romantic oily con artist with a flamboyant comb over, pot belly and heart of gold that fails to ring true in the long run by going soft with his mark a crooked Camden mayor, Sol Politto (cinematographer homage?) another sweetheart of a guy with a Brady bunch family, including an adopted black kid, greedy for bucks but all in the name of altruism. Adams, Cooper, Jeremy Renner as the mayor and Jennifer Lawrence as Irv's off the wall wife more than hold their own with the superb Bale but the projectory of the story begins to lose thrust halfway through as Russell struggles to amp up the suspense with smoke, mirrors and a hint of slapstick.Hustle pads itself heavily with music video to give it an energy and many scenes crackle with it as agent DiMaso, Irving and Sydney play a sexual tension cat and mouse game with each other. But Russell as he did in his last overheated exercise Silver Linings Playbook fails to maintain a consistent mood, vacillating between tension and humor to tell his story making it uneven and ultimately unconvincing as it ties up loose ends in a mawkish way with Russell sacrificing verisimilitude in favor of making his loathsome characters warm and fuzzy for audience consumption. Just like Irving's bilked clients you only find out at the end you are the one who has been had.

Should have read more reviews before wasting my $$$ and time. Admittedly, all the pre-release hoopla conned me.Boring, little to no action, dialogue so long-winded my ears hurt (Bale can do that), and a plot that seems the result of "improv acting", i.e., anyone with lines just delivers them.Despite already being overly-long, the audience keeps waiting for something to happen . . . it doesn't . . . if that's a "spoiler", consider yourself very lucky, i.e., you've been warned by a 68-year old lifelong movie buff.What a waste of good actors.

I cannot guess what people see in this film. The four main actors come off like kids playing dress-up. Only Louis C.K., DeNiro, and other members of the supporting cast come out of this looking like pros at work. This might have been acceptable had the film been a comedy, but at a pace of one laugh per 20-30 minutes, it's not. Instead, it's a long, slow, unpleasant grind that mostly goes nowhere. Yes, there moments of genuine intensity, and yes, the final 15 minutes or so go quite well, but for nearly two hours of running time the only thing keeping me in the theater was the fact that my wife didn't want to leave. This film is way, way overrated; wait for the DVD so you won't feel too cheated when you give up in disgust.

With a current user rating of 8.3 and with ten - yes, 10 - ratings of 100 from the critics, I feel crazy not liking this movie. Critic Richard Roeper writes that "I can't imagine anyone who loves movies not loving THIS movie." I wanted to leave the theater and do something else after 45 minutes. No one else felt this?When flipping through a friend's screen writing book recently, I read that the most important thing a movie has to do is have a main character that the audience sympathizes with, a main character that the audience roots for. Even in a complex case - such as the protagonist of August Wilson's wonderful play "Fences", whom we both detest and sympathize with - the audience must be drawn into actually caring about the main character.This film didn't have a protagonist (that's not a fault - Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" doesn't either), but still I could not have cared less about any character in this film. What was very strange, and a little unsettling, to me was that I felt this immediately, within the first five minutes of the film. Another thing you'll learn from screen writing books is that amateur screenwriters use too much dialogue. This movie is a classic case in amateurish, dialogue-heavy scenes. Constant, ceaseless dialogue really bogged down the film for me. This film didn't have a single bone of subtlety in its entire body. Dialogue, dialogue, dialogue.I saw in one of the trailers that this is a comedy - really!? I chuckled twice, and one of the occasions was in the film's first 30 seconds. There were several jokes that not a single person in the movie theater laughed at. So, in summary, I guess I'm the only person in the world who didn't care for this one. Contrary to Mr. Roeper's assertion at the beginning of this review, I love movies but I strongly disliked this one. My favorite movie is Stanley Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon" - so maybe that explains it.jacobnunnally.blogspot.com

American Hustle: 5 parts style,1 part substance, a chigger of period music, dirty with an expected twistAmerican Hustle attempts to be a David Mamet script filmed by Martin Scorsese. It's a nice try, but it doesn't live up to the challenge. Sure, there are a couple of memorable lines, but the timing is off. Sure, there is some great period music, but it is at times awkward and plays because "we need a song here" and not because it fits. Sure, the costumes are great. They are also great costumes in San Francisco's Castro on Halloween. Sure, the characters are whack, but we don't care about them. You don't have to care about the characters in a movie, but if you don't care about them, they have to be interesting. The characters in American Hustle are neither empathetic nor fascinating. They are retread characters from an old seventies television cop show like Baretta or Kojak. While that's not bad, it's not enough for a major Hollywood film to sustain it. The movie starts at a climatic scene at the end of the second act and cut back to the beginning of the story, not unlike Good Fellas. However, unlike Good Fellas, there's no payoff, so to speak, at the end. The beginning is confusing and it lacks back story and development. The film is at once overly complex and predictably simple.Sure, this movie will get its share of nominations for acting and Danny Elfman's sound track (a bright spot), but it's just not that soulful, ground breaking or hard hitting. Nor is it that entertaining. Rating: Rent it. It's not terrible, and the costumes are fun. However, unless you need to see wide lapels, bad comb-overs, caked on eye-shadow and long lashes larger then life, see it at home on the cheap. Better yet, rent Good Fellas, Casino, Heist or Glengarry Glen Ross to see what you, and the film makers of American Hustle, are missing. Peace,Tex Shelters

Well I can just say that David O. Russel and I don't see eye to eye on stylistic film making. I didn't quite feel like I was in the 70's besides the outrageous outfits and totally distracting hair. Even with hair and wardrobe, Christian Bale still nailed it. As he did in The Fighter. That movie grabbed me, it inspired me, and reeled me in.. I can't say the same for Silver Linings Playbook or this one. I might give David O. Russel another try in the future.. Only if he uses Christian Bale again but that's about it. In the end, this movie was a big let down for me. With all the raving reviews around it, i expected more. It's a movie with incredible actors who i felt tried to conquer each other on set. And only Christian Bale won.

I knew nothing about this film when we sat down in the cinema tonight to see it, so I had no expectations. But from the opening moments I found myself completely engaged by the acting, and interested in the characters straight away.Christian Bale has not done much for me in recent years, but he was captivating in this, and in every single scene. His physical transformation into a slightly overweight conman with a bad comb-over was enhanced by his believable character portrayal, and I have renewed respect for him now as an actor that can be damn interesting to watch.Bradley Cooper was brilliant, as was Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Jennifer Lawrence, and Louis C.K.. There wasn't a single person that didn't pull their weight, and it makes the film's more-than-2-hour-length fly by.There's not much in the way of physical action...in fact, I can't think of anything any action at all really...but the drama of the film is so well handled that action simply isn't necessary. Even the comedic moments were handled superbly.I'd love to criticise something, cos no film is perfect, but this is a tough one to find fault with...maybe I would have left out Lawrence's dance scene when she mimed to Live and Let Die, cos it felt slightly at odds with the rest of the film in my opinion, but that's being seriously harsh.So, to sum up, if you want a movie with top acting, big stars, brilliant dialogue, no over-the-top action and a well thought out story (with some historical truth mixed in), then this one is for you.Trust me, you won't be sorry!

There are cons, hustles, lies, tricks and conspiracies aplenty in writer-director David O. Russell's Oscar-baiting American Hustle. It comes with the territory, of course, in this ostensibly based-on-a-true-story film about con artists working with the FBI to take down corrupt government officials. But one of the biggest hustles Russell pulls off is, quite simply, convincing audiences that they've just watched a great movie. There's no denying that American Hustle is filled with sizzling performances and some of the year's best scenes. But it's also a bit of a hollow, sprawling mess, strung together with great moments that don't really add up to a coherent whole.Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a small-time con artist who's figured out how to swindle his way to moderate success. Unexpectedly, he finds a soulmate in Sydney (Amy Adams), who's equally adept at lying to people and winning their trust and life savings. Rumbled by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), Irving and Sydney - the latter in the guise of her British alter ego, Lady Edith Greensly - agree to help the FBI catch government officials in the act of taking bribes. Around the hapless form of genuine good guy Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) evolves a crazy scheme comprising a made-up Arab sheikh, greedy mobsters, opportunistic politicians, real and fake money, hidden cameras... and the potentially disrupting influence of Irving's slightly unhinged wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence).At its best, there's a loose, loopy charm to American Hustle. It's a story of bad comb-overs and even worse decisions that starts out strongly, as Irving and Sydney take turns narrating their unconventional love story. Several scenes are so outlandishly silly - pretty much any involving the cooked-up Arab sheikh, Rosalyn and Richie's beleaguered boss Stoddard (Louis C.K., hilarious) - that it's impossible not to be swept up in the giddy swirl of confusion and double-crossing in which Russell's characters have wilfully trapped themselves. In those moments when the black comedy peeks through the pretense of its plot, American Hustle approaches the sublime.But Russell's film - which he's revealed is about one-third improvised - is almost too loose and it's certainly too long. The moments that everyone will remember are padded out with narrative convolutions that don't add all that much to proceedings. Most of the scenes drag on a little longer than they presumably would have if the actors had stuck to a script. It's exactly as if Russell let his actors off a leash, and couldn't bear to excise some of their more free-styling moments - even if it would contribute to a smarter, tighter final cut of the film. As a result, the considerable zip, charm and joy of American Hustle's best sequences dissipate from moment to moment, making for a curiously deflating viewing experience.There's no denying, however, that Russell has amassed a clutch of impressive performances from the combined casts of his last two films (The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook). Bale anchors the entire enterprise with a knowing, vanity-free turn as a follicly-challenged hustler with a hidden heart of gold. His silent reactions to the insanity going on around him - whether it's Richie's ego bursting through the ceiling or Rosalyn arguing him into submission - are pitch-perfect. Cooper, too, continues to prove he can actually act under Russell's direction. He has a fine handle on Richie's enormous ego and burgeoning delusions of power and control, delighting in the sheer absurdity of this lawman who gets drunk with delight when he takes a walk on the unlawful side of the street.Awards buzz has been heaped upon Russell's leading ladies as well, and for good reason. Adams spends rather too much of the film off-screen (especially in its second half), but she's so raw, brave, vulnerable and brassy - often in the same scene - that she provides the film with an unexpectedly truthful emotional core. In Adams' hands, Sydney is a rounded, sympathetic creation: one who loses and finds herself again amidst all the lies and deception.Lawrence is a hoot as the mouthy, delusional Rosalyn, tottering through the entire film like a bleached-blonde time-bomb that could explode at any second. She's scintillating, maddening and frequently hilarious, even if it's hard to shake the feeling that she's just not right for the part. Lawrence is talented, no doubt about it - so talented that she almost makes the role work - but she just can't help coming off as precisely what she is: a young girl playing dress-up. Imagine an older actress - say, Julianne Moore, Naomi Watts or heck, even Amy Adams - playing the same role; she would lend the sad, dark weight of age and experience to Rosalyn's kookiness, something the sadly miscast Lawrence can't quite muster (through no fault of her own!) at the tender age of twenty-two.Watch American Hustle for its plot - or a faithful re-enactment of the FBI's Abscam operation in the late 1970s - and you'll be sorely disappointed. Its story is a jumbled mess that isn't half as clever or complicated as it thinks it is. But Russell's cast shine brightly nonetheless. Their bold performances - and gleefully terrible hairdos - are the real strength and energy of Russell's film. For many moments, they make it easy to believe that American Hustle is the real thing. But take a closer look and it becomes clear that this diamond was really just cubic zirconia all along.

"American Hustle" is one of those movies that when you watch you feel entertained and fresh still you feel a little sour and down to earth after you see what the world of greed and power struggle can do to people as each person and every organization is full of corruption and must figure out their own way and methods to survive. Based on the real life scandals of the 1970's mid to late of the 10 year period in New Jersey a con man named Irving Rosenfeld(Christian Bale)meets up with a sexy social kitten Sydney Prosser(in Amy Adams's best and most sexy role)and together they form a team that lures scandal and con games to make money for them as each and every way each scam is tied to different organizations and cruel underworlds. Even when FBI agent Richie Dimaso(Bradley Cooper)enters the investigation he joins the team with a plan to oddly enough set up a crooked and corrupt politician and that's a New Jersey city mayor named Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and you guessed with politics it's dirty laundry that involves power brokers and the mafia. All along Rosalyn Rosenfeld(Jennifer Lawrence)the wife of crime king Irving just drinks up her pain and sorrow of sin in distilled spirits. Overall "American Hustle" rings true to life as every person is for him or her it's a way of life with greed, corruption and scandal as director David O. Russell again proves with a cast that has great chemistry that life is tough dark and never pretty as sometimes you have to do it ugly just to get by and live.

Despite it's stellar cast and great production creds, "American Hustle" is little more than a sinners-with-a-heart of gold story. YAWN!!! It plays like a particularly sad Woody Allen movie without the jokes. The film is definitely not a comedy, though Jennifer Lawrence provides not only the best character but most of the few laughs the film has. Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner are particularly effective in their parts. Bradley Cooper does a solid job with the most complex character in the film. Amy Adams is fine, but not award worthy for a change. Watch "The Grifters" if you want a devilishly clever con-film, because it is 1,000,000 times better.Honestly, the NY Film Critics Assn. must have gotten a con-sized pay off for calling this the best film of the year. Is it awful? No. But neither is it memorable. Fun soundtrack, great costumes, hair/make-up and photography can't make up for a plot which is dull and characters who are so uninteresting.

In American vernacular, "hustle" has several definitions. One of the definitions is "to cheat". Another reference is a type of dance, popular in the 70s disco craze. "American Hustle" is about a con job that is choreographed better than any dance move you can think of. The first screen capture read "some of this actually happened". The true part of the film is easy to recognize. During the waning days of the 70s, the US Feds operated a sting operation meant to capture corrupt US politicians. ABSCAM generated a lot of headlines and, if you're interested in the details, Google is your friend. The good part of the film, though, is a fictional story of how a couple of grifters get recruited by the Feds. Robert DeNiro is on screen less than a minute, in an uncredited role of a possibly corrupt casino owner, and he's substantially more menacing than his role in the execrable celluloid cesspool "Malavita". Jennifer Lawrence portrays a completely out-of-control wife, and her performance reminded me of Elizabeth Taylor in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf". This movie is a gem, and I highly recommend it.

This movie was surprisingly good. By watching the trailers, I didn't really know what was going to go on so I went into it somewhat clueless. It reminded me a lot of Pulp Fiction, just in the style that it was done (although not in many different stories that all make one eventually) but by it starting off in the middle and then went back and continued from the beginning. It did seem to drag on though. Some parts could have been shortened but overall, it was a good film. The costumes were good and the ladies were for sure beautiful! I loved their hair throughout the entire film. Especially Jennifer Lawrences updo. I will definitely see this film again, although probably not in theaters.

I do not understand any of the bad reviews overall it was the best movie i have seen in theaters since inglorious bastards. It was very well written and the acting was superb Jennifer Lawrence and Christian Bale should both be up for Oscars. I laughed and i loved the characters but most importantly the story line was perfect and original. Well done film that had depth and weight. The movie also got me to hate Bradley Coopers character which is not an easy thing to do because I am a huge fan. Easily the best movie of the year I believe it beats Gravity and Her but that being said you will have to see it yourself. I can not imagine anyone seeing this movie and being disappointed.

If there was yet any doubt in your mind from his previous two films 'The Fighter' and 'Silver Linings Playbook' that director David O' Russell is on a creative streak, then his latest 'American Hustle' should convince you unequivocally to put these qualms to rest. Taking an unconventional approach to the loose retelling of the Abscam scandal, a late 1970s FBI sting operation that led to bribery convictions for a U.S. senator and several members of the House, it sees Russell at his most invigorated yet, a wild and woolly ride through the dark and dizzy heart of American ambition brimming with so much unbridled verve that it is quite impossible not to get caught up in its rapture.Co-written by Russell and Eric Warren Singer, it begins on a definitively offbeat note with a paunchy Christian Bale painstakingly putting together his hair with some glue, a forlorn toupee and a comb- over. Bale's transformation into the balding and bloated con man Irving Rosenfeld is a revelation in itself, one of his character reinventions that demonstrate his commitment as an actor and his astonishing ability to disappear into just about any role that he takes on. But more about Bale and the rest of the ensemble later on – what is apparent from this very opening scene is Russell's screwball exuberance to the material, which recalls both stylistically and spiritually the spirit of vintage Scorcese.That sequence thrusts its viewer into the same frame with the rest of the key actors - Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) and Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) - whose roles in relation to Irving become clearer after Russell rewinds to recount the events leading up to that terse and tense exchange. Allowing his characters their own voices, Russell lets Irving and Sydney narrate their own individual livelihoods - the former as a con artist with a dry cleaning business on the side and the latter as a knockout stripper from New Mexico - before the pair bond at a Long Island pool party over a shared passion for Duke Ellington's "Jeep's Blues" as well as a mutual belief in reinventing their respective lives.Making use of an alternate identity as Lady Edith Greenleigh, Sydney builds a fake loan scheme with Irving using the company guise of London Associates. Their grifting enterprise becomes so successful that they attract the attention of Richie, an ambitious FBI agent whose latest target is white collar criminals and whom arm-twists the pair into setting up a scam involving a fake sheikh (Michael Pena) to reel in some bigger fish. What follows is an increasingly elaborate - and dangerous - sting operation that calls into question their shifting personas and motivations, especially as the all-too eager Ritchie works his way up the food chain with New Jersey mayor Carmine as his prime focus and eventually unwitting pawn.While the title ostensibly refers to Irving and Sydney's business, the brilliantly written script slowly peels back the layers of each and every one of its characters to reveal each as a 'hustler'. For Ritchie, that means refusing to see through the delusions of his FBI glory to recognise the good intentions of Carmine and the rest of his targets. It also is refusing to accept his hen-pecked life in a working-class home with a mother and fiancé, and finding distraction instead in his growing attraction for Sydney. And for Irving and Sydney, their hustle lies not only in their schemes but also in their personal lives, what with Irving being married to a much younger but also much more unhinged wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) whose young son is the apple of his eye. There are no perfect characters here, no saints or heroes or role models to look up to; rather, each in his or her own way inevitably resorts to some form of hustling in order to survive.It is evident from how richly Russell sketches these characters that he loves each and every one of them, and his passion for the material is matched by the enthusiasm and creative energy that each one of his actors brings. Reflecting that perfect synergy between actor and director, Russell and his ace cast share a trust and confidence in each other that is demonstrated in the boldness with which they take to their roles. Not one of these actors is a stranger to Russell - Bale and Adams from 'The Fighter' and Cooper and Lawrence from 'Silver Linings Playbook' - and their combination sets off an explosive chemistry that counts as acting fireworks. Indeed, 'American Hustle' might very well be Russell's best film that boasts a perfect balance of the director's spontaneity and control. He gives his gallery of strays, cheaters and deceivers plenty of room to roam far and wide, and yet nothing feels superfluous at any point. And in that corral, we see Bale's magnificently understated performance, one that grows in pathos and dignity as he is called upon to be the film's moral centre; we also see Adams' most versatile act yet, showing a depth in a darker and more dangerous role than she has ever played; we are also treated to Cooper at his funniest and liveliest, digging deep to unearth a maniacal side yet unseen; last but not least, a simply magnetic Lawrence who is mesmerising as "the Picasso of passive- aggressive karate". Exceptional performances from some of the finest actors of our generation, a director at the top of his game, and an intriguing subject that finds its relevance even today, this is one movie that belongs on your must-see list and every critic's best-of list of the year.

American Hustle is no blockbuster, not Batman-like action, no explosion (perhaps one small one when the oven caught fire), no sexy love-making scenes (is Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence not wearing bra good enough?). But (well, there's always a "but" in all my reviews), the main leads are so good and strong in their characters that they made the fictional characters alive.American Hustle has a simple plot with many complicated characters. Each characters are so different (no worries about confusing them with one another) that it was hilarious having them together. I love the film for the characters, but not the plot. The characters' late 70s dress style (or should I say hair style?) was amazing. Be it Irving's (Christian Bale) bald head combed to make the hair fuller, Rosalyn's upswept hair (Jennifer Lawrence), Richie's (Bradley Cooper) fake curls or Carmine's (Jeremy Renner) Elvis Presley hairdo, they are all screaming seventies. There's plenty of style, but little substance.The terrific characters played by the wonderful actors earned four out of five stars from me. I'm impressed how I could still remember each character, with their characteristics, given that there were five main leads, even after the film. Jennifer Lawrence's insane (and somewhat bimbotic) lines made her shine despite not having as many scenes as Amy Adams.Why not full marks then?Read more: http://tiffanyyong.com/2013/12/24/american-hustle-movie- review/

Truly a disappointing movie. There was so much potential to the story but it was just, boring. Was it supposed to be a romance, action, drama? A Comedy? I've seen several note it was hilarious but no one in my theater let out more than a random chortle from time to time.It started out with a flashback, but when caught up to the beginning moment, the movie continues for another hour. The whole thing was an unfortunately mess. Its sad that with all the potential of a great story and phenomenal talent that nothing came of it.Rarely do I see a movie where I'm sick that I actually spent money on it, but this is one. Makes me nauseous even as I write this.

The story is great, thats all that needs to be said there. The rest of my words deserve to go to the poor outcome of the movie. BORING!!!! There is so much extra information that doesn't even go with the storyline. Every time the story begins to get interesting it is ruined by extra scenes that are unnecessary to the plot. They tried to add in some "raunchy" comedy garbage that absolutely ruined the movie in every aspect I can think of. BAD BAD BAD BAD Although it was one of the most interesting plots in any movie I've seen in 2013 the raunchy comedy and unnecessary scenes skyrocketed this movie to the top of my hate list for 2013. If you like raunchy comedy intertwined with a serious plot then this movie is for you...although I imagine very few people enjoy the latter.

"American Hustle" is a pretty darn good, entertaining, and fun film. While I don't think it's director David O' Russell's best film, I still think it is his best directed. It is directed with a flashy style that really fits with the era of the movie. There are many over the top moments and exaggerated camera sweeps that really brings a lot of excitement on screen. The script is layered with hilarious dialogue and deeper meaning of living the "American Dream" than what is actually being presented on screen. However, I wish it did have more focus and a tighter story as it did feel like it was all over the place. The journey is also more satisfying than the actual conclusion.The cast is great and the director really gets some amazing performances from the cast. Christian Bale, Amy Adams, and Bradley Cooper are great in their roles and play very dimensional characters. They make them come alive and their on-screen chemistry is great. However, the real stand-out in this star studded cast is Jennifer Lawrence, who doesn't have as much depth or screen time, but commands total attention on-screen. She embodies everything that the movie is going for by being over the top, zany, and full on entertaining. Every time she was off-screen, I kept on begging for more.Overall, "American Hustle" is a really good movie that is equal parts entertaining and thought provoking. It never reaches any emotional highs and needs some focus, but David O' Russell's stylish direction, use of high energy music, and committed cast makes this movie something special. I give it 4.5/5

I have to admit that I was allured by the film's critical acclaim, and having seen and immensely enjoyed 'Silver Linings Playbook', I thought I was in for another David O. Russell hit. The film has its moments, the plot is fairly simple, con artists get busted by the FBI, and they have to dig themselves out of a hole, by helping the FBI catch a bunch of crooked politicians. The story progresses with moments of jealousy and all sorts of dysfunctional relationships. The film's structure and style is a complete rip off from Martin Scorsese: the voice over, music, freeze frames, slow motion, flash cuts, are all trademark Scorsese storytelling techniques, which are over used. The ensemble was enjoyable as a whole, but individually I felt like I was watching caricatures of people and not actual people, in the exception of Jeremy Renner. Overall, I really did enjoy the film, I see it more as a comedy, I felt none of the characters were ever in real danger, or any of the "drama" plausible. Anyone who goes out to watch this movie will probably enjoy it, but it won't blow your mind or leave an impression. You'll forget you saw it once you get out of your seat.

The con artist mentality – everyone is a sucker and the more you say NO to "marks", the more they want what you are selling; conversely everyone likes to play the film-flam game – that is the basic premise of David O. Russell's goofy, madcap new film American HUSTLE. And the Federal Government turns out to be the ultimate hustler in the "idealistic" pursuit of justice or "entrapment"– a thin line that bends and sways depending on the ambitions of prosecutors. The word "real" is used in the dialogue over and over and over againdisguise is the norm – being "real" involves a rare moment of trust and exposure of your inner self which always reeks of a putrid scent, barely camouflaged by the fragrance of nectar that we employ as a shield of body armor.This convoluted, crazily complex movie originated "somewhat" with a true story-the ABSCAM scandal of the 1970's. Understanding the source will help make sense of American HUSTLE, giving you the opportunity to relax and be entertained, without being distracted trying to puzzle out what is going on. ABSCAM was an FBI sting operation in the late 1970s and early1980s, initially trafficking in stolen property but later converted to a public corruption investigation. The FBI hired Melvin Weinberg, a convicted con man, to help plan and conduct the operation. "Abscam" was the FBI codename for the undertaking, because it involved Abdul Enterprises, Ltd., as its front company, using an FBI employee posing as Karim Abdul Rahman, a fictional Middle Eastern sheikh bribing targeted government officials in videotaped meetings. Suffice it to say Atlantic City and its burgeoning casino industry were in the mix, ultimately leading to the conviction of a United States senator, six members of the House of Representatives, one member of the New Jersey State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, and an inspector for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.Christian Bale (terrific) still handsome after gaining over 40 lbs playing the beer bellied mastermind and proud-of-it charlatan, Irving Rosenfeld (based on Abscam's Melvin Weinberg) who owns many dry-cleaning and window glass stores in the Bronx and Manhattan – all small time establishments fronting illegal loan activities. The movie opens with Irving fashioning his daily make-over on an elaborately funny and very serious comb-over – a source of pride and concealment before attending a cocktail party where he glances over and BAMMM sees a gorgeous Amy Adams who portrays the seductive, alabaster toned Sydney Prosser, and Irving Rosenfeld is hooked on the spot – meeting his match in brains and larceny. But this dame is a classy one, who has already "masked" her persona, and intuiting a fellow traveler responds to Christian Bale in kind. A love story is in the making, despite the fact that Irving is married to a surprisingly, (for me) wonderfully, eccentric, often inept, and unsuitable (to his chosen profession) wife, Rosalyn played by Jennifer Lawrence, who might be the most authentic person in American HUSTLER.Adams and Bale join forces and become partners in crime, and business is soon flourishing until a wildly enterprising, tightly curled poodle cut, FBI undercover agent, Bradley Cooper (Richie DiMaso) shows up and snares them in his net. From then on our heroes are working for the impulsive, righteously manic, Cooper in order to stay out of jail.And then the fun begins! Larger and more intricate schemes including Abscam (Arab scam) loom ahead. Passionate avidity blossoms as a Mafioso - a critical bit part by a barely recognizable Robert De Niro - gets enmeshed into the conspiracy. Despite harebrained shenanigans and lots of heedless bungling, and plot twists, the underlying romance perseveres, complicated by Christian Bale's hesitant equivocation concerning the age-old choice between wife and girlfriend. Another memorable character, a linchpin of the FBI shakedown operation - Jeremy Renner is startling as the oblivious, charismatic Mayor Carmine Polito of Camden NJ, complete with an Elvis-style mop of hair, and the only politician who actually cares and works for his constituents. He is the one genuinely tragic figure in this tale.American HUSTLER is a complicated mosaic of cynicism, questions of credibility, legitimacy and the art of illusion tempting desire. The energetic soundtrack weaves through each scene punctuating the activity; passages are episodic - some hilarious and others predictable. Absurdity nesting in farce can be sublimethose resplendent moments appear and vanish like the hypothesis of the film itself.

Just got out of the theater for this one. American Hustle is a brilliant blend of great acting, a perfect script, and copious amounts of dark humor to keep everyone thoroughly entertained during the film's two hour and twenty minute run time.Bale absolutely nails it as a sleazy con man that we can somehow relate to and shake our heads at the whole time, and Adams has once again grown as a competent actress to match him. This duo could not have been more perfect for this story. Bradly Cooper also extends his acting range and slowly let's the audience in on the pathetic nature of his character. Cooper had several scenes that had the whole crowd rolling with laughter. ...and the there's Jennifer Lawrence. Wow. Will she ever stop topping her self in these dramatic roles? I was worried about a younger actor standing up to the other heavy weights on screen, but she steals the show in every scene she has. The "Live and Let Die" scene is bound to wind up a classic.To speak of Hustle's convoluted (but ultimately tried and true) plot would be cheating (hustling) the audience out of the fun residing in this masterpiece. While certain scenes definitely required more developed empathy for the characters to achieve the desired effect, Hustle invests the time to keep us on edge at least, and is a film that gets better with each and every scene.Go see it with attentive eyes and you shall not be disappointed.9/10

Just saw this movie with my wife and 17 yr. old daughter on the Christmas holiday and now we are wishing we made a different choice. We picked this movie because we loved the promos, actors and storyline, but unfortunately we were severely underwhelmed. In fact we heard many negative comments from throughout the crowd as we were exiting the theater expressing similar feelings to our own.Maybe the movie is more for those who study the craft, but we were amazed on how bored from the storyline we actually were. There is not much action, not much comedy, not much drama...just don't know how to describe this. With all of the great actors involved, we were expecting much more. In fact, I believe we were the ones hustled...for $34!

Wow, filmmaker David O. Russell has come a long way to becoming one of the most popular filmmakers today. Recently having impressed audiences with The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, Russell has struck gold a third time in a row with his latest flick, American Hustle.Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a man from the Bronx who sports a comb over hairstyle. He works in running cons with his lover Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams). They have been doing successful in conning people to giving them money thanks to Sydney's fake British persona Edith Greensley. Even though they are succeeding, they're lives are complicated by Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who he refuses to divorce out of fear of not being allowed to see his son. It isn't until FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) tricks them by being a customer and then arresting Sydney. Feeling attracted to Sydney, Richie will release them on the condition that they help him arrest four other con artists.In order to set this up, Irving has one of his friends pose as an Arab Sheik looking to invest in American business. An associate suggests doing business with Camden, NJ mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), who is looking to legalize gambling. David O. Russell's film is one of mystery, craziness, and you don't really know who is conning who until it is all revealed at the end.David O. Russell continue to show his excellence in directing. Russell does just right at pointing the camera at what is important to the story and how what is happening pays off. Another way Russell shows his skill as a story teller is keeping us interested in these characters, who are not really likable.Eric Warren Singer and Russell co-wrote the script, which gives the film a nice Goodfellas vibe. With the majority of their screenplay focused on Irving and Sydney, it gives us a nice insight into what is in it for each of these characters and how they are all developed.Christian Bale does an excellent job leading this ensemble as the con man who wants business. Bale dedicates himself to this performance by having gained weight and giving Irving an interesting looking comb over hairstyle. With this role, Bale shows us a guy who does his best to keep his cool despite what he's going through. Amy Adams is knocks her role out of the park as Bale's co-lead and Irving's lover Sydney Prosser. Adams does some impressive work not just as a con artist tricking people with her British accent, but also keeping us on our toes in making us unsure if she is loyal to Irving or Richie. Bradley Cooper is the best in show here as FBI agent Richie DiMaso. As Richie, Cooper showed us how much he has grown as an actor. I liked the choices Cooper made in showing us how much charge Richie is taking and keeping things in order, while trying to please his unhappy boss. Jennifer Lawrence is a riot as she pulls off the role of a 1970's New York housewife. Lawrence engulfs herself into looking the part to a tee, with the hairstyle and dresses she wears. Lawrence does so by using the mannerisms used then and how she gets nosy into her husband's business. Jeremy Renner does some nice work as the mayor who wants to do what he can to bring business to Camden and be able to get the economy going. I even enjoyed the cameo by Robert De Niro as Victor Tellegio, a mob boss who is also looking to do business in Atlantic City.I also quite enjoyed some of the technical aspects to it. The production design of the film done by Judy Becker was so well done, I felt like I was right there in 1970's New York. The costumes designed by Michael Wilkinson felt authentic to the time period depicted in the film. The soundtrack also had a lot of great tunes that also contributed to the Goodfellas vibe I was getting.

Brilliant con man Irving Rosenfield and his alluring partner in the con, Sydney Prosser are forced to work with FBI agent Richie DiMaso in a high stakes con that eventually involves New Jersey power brokers, U.S. politicians and the mob. Loyalties are tested as the lines blur between control and chaos, where the con eventually becomes the only reality that they can trust...Gripping in its semi true story, you will find yourself watching as these characters spiral into a world of chaos. Brilliantly acted by Bale and company you slowly become to realize that you are watching some of Hollywood's best actors today. Though this movie of crime, cons and passions is slow at first, it eventually picks up steam. Director David O. Russell holds nothing back and neither do his actors. Transported to New York/ New Jersey of the 70's the sound track brilliantly authenticates this movie, and serves as a perfect companion to the film. The set pieces, the wardrobe even the grittiness of the film itself reminds one of a movie straight out of the 70's Alluring and sexually charged in certain scenes as well as good points of humor to ease the tension. Not a full drama, and not a full comedy but a blend of both that delivers, not the best movie I've seen but indeed on that is worthy of the praise it receives.

This rewarding true story of two con artists in the70s who are forced to assist the FBI is enjoyable and worth watching for the terrific performances Christian Bale gives a convincing accent and performance with his scary toupee. His partner in crime is played by Amy Adams who is given a racy role to show of her versatility as an actress and she looks stunning. Her low cut dresses were a bit overdone though. Jennifer Lawrence is very funny as the idiot wife. Bradley Cooper is alright but his role isn't that demanding.The only minus point is that I got lost a couple of times in the latter third of the movie. The narrative could have been clearer. With such a complicated plot it helps to not break up the continuity and explain things a bit.

Fun movie, great cast with Bale and Adams.Good soundtrack.I like the good times, like when they first meet.Supporting cast very good but maybe someone little more mature for Jennifer Lawrence role.Politicians and mobsters need each other. Nothing new right.Cooper role over-dorked and maybe a little bigger twist at end would had been better.Sorry I couldn't make 10 lines. What is up with the 10 line thing? I did like this movie.

I thought "Saving Mr. Banks" was going to give Emma Thompson the Lady Big Oscar but I'm wrong. Amy Adams, the owner of magnificent cleavage despite small breasts, will win it.And I thought Forrest Whitaker would win for "The Butler." Wrong again. It'll be Christian Bale who offers the finest lead actor emotion and dialogue I've just about ever seen. The man is amazing. And last but not least, we have Jennifer Lawrence doing a tremendous job as the gorgeous but lonely wife who will win Best Supporting Actress. This film will win for Best Screenplay, Best Director and last but not least, Best Picture of the Year. What a story based on ABSCAM. Using crooks to nab crooks and the twists and turns are phenomenal.And of course, every movie must have the great Robert DiNiro who sneaks into this one, does a spellbinding cameo and then disappears. Is the picture long? Yes, but who cares? I didn't want it to end-that's how darn good it is.I write reviews not for the purpose of telling anyone the storyline of the picture. That's because anyone can read a synopsis. My job is to tell you how a movie hits me and this one is a Howitzer shell. A fantastic movie experience and I personally feel that those who knock this knockout film, has no taste whatsoever.

American Hustle's filming-style is artistic, and the angles captured are attention-grabbing, somewhat resembling the Tarantino-style cinematography in certain scenes. Very thought-out cinematography. The film's screenplay was entertaining, the dialogue authentic, weaving both drama and comedy together in a harmonious fashion. Christian Bale was phenomenal in this film, demonstrating exceptional versatility, and incredibly amusing to watch. And, Amy Adams intense expression of feelings and facial expressions are remarkable. Wacky hairstyles and marvelous clothing design collaborate in creating the eccentric setting. Some level of predictability arguable, yet a very amusing and well-made film throughout.

Many films nowadays fall victim to the trap of self-sacrifice--sacrificing characters for the sake of the plot, sacrificing the plot for the sake of characters, sacrificing intelligence for a visual escape, etc. The list runs long. 'American Hustle', on the other hand, sacrifices nothing. It is greedy in terms of wanting everything and achieving a step more. It is ambitious in being ambitious. It is beautiful. It is the best movie of 2013. Many viewers claim to be confused and/or bored by the plot. This is a grievous misstep on their part, in my opinion. The brilliance of the plot lies in the thematic mists of the 'gray area.' From the very beginning of the film, deceit, deception, and a wildly fantastic British accent flourish on screen--and that's for the "good guys." The opening scene of obsessive hair care illuminates that point. Throughout the film every character continually re-invents themselves in order to survive. Alliances are never a sure thing, and suspicious eyes view the character's choices from beginning to end. The movie does an unparalleled job of making the audience realize that life, and choices, are not black and white. We live in a world of gray. This is cleverly referenced in Rosalyn's sickly sweet nail polish, the downfall of Carmine, who is a guy with good intentions and is punished accordingly, and the unorthodox work relationship under which Richie operates. This is off-putting to some people, I reason, who do not wish their own demons so blatantly danced across the big screen. Perhaps, it is time they drop their own phony accent, and own up to life. The acting was out of this world. Every single one of them--Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Lawrence--deserved their nominations. Bale is subtle and brilliant as Irving, the main conman. He is unappealing and dubious, yet you can't help but like him. His later soft heart towards Jeremy Renner's Carmine is icing on the cake for the dabbling in the gray area. Amy Adams shines, literally at times, as Sydney, Irving's con partner. She is the most volatile and hardest character to read for most of the film. Adams embodies the cocoon that Sydney has created with elegance and fiery deceit. Cooper is entirely convincing as the Richie, the FBI agent whose own ambition proves to be too much. Cooper brings the same electrifying energy he put on display for 'Silver Linings Playbook' (2012), and doesn't miss a beat between howl of laughter of roar of frustration as his plans become convoluted to a maximal degree. Jeremy Renner is also an absolute winner as Carmine, the mayor, despite not receiving an award nod as of yet. Renner is the consummate politician, and you can't help but sympathize with his character (even though you wonder if you should be, 95% of the time). Last, but certainly not least, is Jennifer Lawrence's Rosalyn, Irving's hysterical, deranged wife. The hype around Lawrence's role is well-deserved, she solidified herself among the elite with this role. Each of her scenes brought laughs and anticipation as you awaited what sort of screwball situations her character would stir up next. Standing ovation to all of the cast on this one--you stand far high above the rest. At the core, this movie is more than just a dazzling spectacle of throwback clothing and crazy hairstyles. It speaks to an era. It speaks to human emotion and ambition. It speaks to the world we live in today. It speaks sometimes with an infectious British accent and sometimes adroitly American. Most importantly, it speaks. Go out and listen to what it has to say.

What really made this movie for me was Jennifer Lawrence. She stole every scene that she was in. Whether she's accidentally setting her kitchen on fire, angry dancing to "Live and Let Die" or walking around with a neck brace, she was absolutely hilarious. But she was also very charming and made me feel for her character. I even teared up a bit when she was at the restaurant with Pete and she started crying about how "she doesn't like change". I mean, she was wonderful. I would love to see her win another Oscar. Her accent was pretty spot on too. All of the other actors were pretty good too. Although, I thought Amy Adam's British accent was distracting. I don't know if it was meant to come across that way...but it wasn't good.I also really loved the costumes. They all looked authentic 70s garb. I actually really dug a lot of Amy's "booby" costumes. The hairstyles were awful....but purposefully awful and they too worked. Even the atmosphere, and the colours they used for the filters had a 70s vibe to it.However, I thought the rest of the film seemed like a mess. I didn't like how the story played out on screen. And I thought the voice-overs were annoying. Like, they would say stuff like "I thought he was charming". "I met her 2 years ago". And I would sit there like....Who are you addressing this to? The audience? Why is this necessary? It was distracting, annoying and not needed. Im sure you can properly convey this to an audience without actually having to actually say it.

If you plan on seeing this film, do not expect to see one that is heavy on the plot. The plot for this film is used almost exclusively as a setting for the characters to interact. With that being said, all of the characters become part of an intricate plot that is bigger than themselves, and David O. Russel does an incredible job of humanizing each of the players in this game. I found myself not looking forward to some "big bang" ending or intricate underlying twist like that of an Oceans flick, but awaiting the next interaction between conflicting characters and just how pathetic, comedic, humanizing, or intimate they can reveal themselves to be. It's a movie about strongly connected characters and how they will blindly step all over each other in order to achieve their goals. The entire cast is incredible at their roles and it's wonderful seeing such beautiful people playing such flawed, vulnerable, and believable characters. If you go to this movie expecting an action-packed plot with a Hollywood ending, you will leave disappointed. If you go into the movie with an interest in the characters and their evolution throughout the film, you'll be delighted at every turn.

American Hustlewww.realmoviereviews4you.blogspot.com Rotten Tomatoes- 94% My Score- 9/10Set in the 70's this dramatic comedy tells the some-what true story of two in love con artists, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), who get trapped by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who offers them a way out of their crimes if they help him bust 4 other cons. Soon the whole deal gets out of hand when they get entangled in a world full of corrupt Politicians (one of which is played by Jeremy Renner) and Mobsters. Also weaved into the story line is Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Bale's unpredictable wife In the film). Her performance steals the show leaving you gasping for more. The film plays a little slow but is sped up with unexpected laughs waiting at every corner. Acting as a sort of third part in the David O. Russell (Director) box set, this film reunites Adams, Bale, and Renner from The Fighter and Lawrence, Cooper, and De Niro from last years Silver Linings Playbook. Both movies led to many award nominations and wins as well as a Best Actress Oscar for Jennifer Lawrence. With its powerful yet light script, mesmerizing performances, and outstanding direction, you can expect this years "American Hustle" to sweep award shows and possibly end up with some Academy Awards.-ReaL Movie Reviews Hannah Lynn Meadows-

I don't usually try to buy into hype. It's led to some underwhelming results, both in life and in following the film industry. Life is full of disappointments.Around a year ago, I posted my review for Silver Linings Playbook, joking about how with an all-star cast and a notable director, a film can still fail (even though I do like Silver Linings). Here we are, a year later, with a film more star-studded than Elton John's wardrobe that manages to be a disappointment on a number of levels, one of which being the acting.Christian Bale is fantastic in his role as a leading con man, and while I never considered him particularly charismatic, he definitely retains that quality with Hustle. Bradley Cooper does what Bradley Cooper is supposed to do, and Jeremy Renner is fine, but the rest of the parts fall short on a number of levels. Amy Adams in particular is a letdown, with many of her lines seeming forced or clumsy. Jennifer Lawrence can't determine how to make facial expressions half of the time, and it's not due to "indecisiveness"; it's a matter of not portraying emotions properly.But still, Hustle retains an interesting plot that is ultimately lacking in depth but it makes up for it somewhat with scattered humour and The Big Sleep-esque plot maneuvering. I'm not one to complain about not sympathizing with lead characters, but I didn't sympathize with the lead characters. Yes, we see how an unexpected couple fall in love, and how someone from that couple falls in love with another, who is in love with another, who may or may not be in love with another, etc. There is no depth, however, to these relationships. There's a reason why the love- triangle is one of the most popular plot devices; it appeals to a broad audience, it creates plot tension, but also it allows for thematic depth. There is none of this in Hustle.Still, the biggest issue with Hustle is perhaps its script. It seems like the script a 20 year old film buff would write. For some people, that's great. For me, I expect more out of my films than something oozing clichés and immature dialogue (immature as in lacking depth). The reason why Tarantino is an excellent writer is because he recognizes these tropes and is able to channel them into his highly unique style. Russel simply churns out a mediocre script that attempts to beat the audience over the head with the plot.It's entertainment enough, however, and the costumes are convincing as is the makeup. Watching Christian Bale for an extended amount of time is always a good thing. But I couldn't see myself recommending it on any serious level beyond that.

Perfect acting in fact great acting but it goes nowhere and is hard to understand and follow the terrible plot definitely overrated great disappointment if you really want to see it wait till it comes out on DVD but even then don't say I didn't warn you. most of all the actors in the movie were born for better things than this and last of all We all know an ending makes a movie this one just made it a lot worse sorry everybody save your money please for my sake..don't make the same mistake that I made. Lets all wait for the 2014 year and hope that these actors and directors make better decisions and that we'll make up for the huge and greatly disappointing movie we all just had to witness like I said these actors have all seen better days and I'm sorry but they were "conned" into being in this one.

I really needed this film two days after watching and being so disappointed with Gravity. I am pretty sure that American Hustle will make ways less money than 'Gravity' and will get less Academy Awards if any. It is however a much better film in my opinion, smart and sensitive, funny and entertaining, and in its way represents much better today's (or yesterday's) America.The story happens in the late 70s – early 80s in Manhattan and part in New Jersey, these two settings which may provide the background for more than half of the movies about America today, and is based in part on the real story of an FBI investigation that discovered wide-spread corruption in the local and national politics. In order to infiltrate in the local environment the Bureau investigator (Bradely Cooper) devices a scheme in which he blackmails a couple composed of a con man (Christian Bale) and his partner and lover (Amy Adams) are sent to lure a local politician and then other by offering them bribes. Same as in director David O. Russell previous film Silver Linings Playbook, (also set between NJ and NYC) none of the characters is really normal, they all have their non-negligible dose foolishness, malice and stupidity.There are two reasons for which American Hustle works well. The first is that the structure of the script is well designed, and the characters are very credible with all their goods and flaws. The second is that Russell's style of directing his actors enhanced the feeling of authenticity. Russell picked a team of very talented actors whom he knew well from previous films and let them create and improvise each their own roles. The result is bright. Christian Bale is hard to recognize physically, he is a smart and pathetic, loving and cynical con man. The actor of so many feel-good movies Bradley Cooper is mean and dark. For the first time I have seen here Jennifer Lawrence in a role (Bale's wife) that justifies the praises he received from many critics. Last and best – Amy Adams is unbelievably beautiful and vulnerable – she looks like a 2013 version of the best of what Jane Fonda could be. The cake has a glazing, and it's called Robert De Niro (uncredited for some reasons) – he does the older and tired version of the role he played so many times, and I hope that his devastated looks were just make-up.Smartest, maybe best American film that I have seen in a while.

This movie starts out as an unmitigated clunker. For the first half hour or so the story is a meandering nothing, featuring characters who are utterly devoid of interest. This movie is so flat that it gives cause to leave it alone, and chalk it as another waste of time and money. Then, all of a sudden, the movie takes on new life. It immediately becomes interesting, exciting, and above all, fun to watch, and the reason for that: Bradley Cooper. He saves the movie; in fact, he IS the movie. He so thoroughly dominates this movie, meaning, every scene, that the producers could have sent the rest of the cast home. Christian Bale is not funny; Amy Adams is not funny; Jennifer Lawrence is outright shrill; Robert De Niro isn't even credited; but Bradley Cooper IS funny, and engaging, and, most importantly, entertaining. He carries this movie. The story itself is ridiculous, another Hollywood parody on law enforcement, and suggests that federal agents can be co-opted and turned by con artists whose cons are so transparent that a child could see through them. Bradley Cooper rates a 10; the rest of the movie rates a 5. 10+5=15/2=7.5, round off to the next highest number, 8, hence the rating of 8.

What a horrific movie this is! Yuk!!! Get away from this monstrosity of a picture! Kidding! Just conning you because everyday I'm hustling LMFAO!!! I am no pun hustler, well maybe a little, but one thing I know that is real is that "American Hustle" is one of the best if not the best movie of 2013. Director David O. Russell strikes gold again with another impressive playbook in orchestrating a motion picture. "American Hustle" stars a top-of-his-game Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld, a lifelong New York con artist who teams up with the beautiful Sydney Prosser to con desperate men asking for loans. Amy Adams plays Prosser with exact precision. Not to mention, Amy has never looked better in a movie; Will Larry Flynt be calling Amy for a Hustler cover? Who knows? But she is better than that. Anyways, when Irving and Sydney get busted by FBI Agent Richie DiMaso (masterfully played by Bradley Cooper), the con game goes into a governmental level. DiMaso uses Irving and Sydney to seize elected officials in taking bribes; this was all based on the real life Abscam scandal of the late 70's. The movie is set in the 70's and it is presented also as a love letter to that "won't play by the rules" decade, and that is the way uh-huh uh-huh I like it. Jennifer Lawrence also is on target here as Irving's showy wife Rosalyn. Jeremy Renner contributed a major Mayor performance as the targeted Mayor Carmine Polito. The entire acting ensemble of "American Hustle" was spectacular, but my favorite performance of the movie was of Cooper's as DiMaso. David O. Russell co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Singer, and what a money script it was. Sure Mr. Russell did incorporate a few Scorseseisms in his direction and writing of "American Hustle", but he did inject his own Russell muscle to it also. This movie should garner a plethora of Oscar nominations for Acting, Screenplay, and Direction among many other categories; and if it doesn't, there has to be some type of con going on in the Academy. So get on your Con-Air vehicle to witness the cinematic brilliance of "American Hustle". In other words, do the hustle!!!! ***** Excellent

I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since "Inception." I've read the critics' reviews and the user reviews here - I encourage you to believe the professional critics on this one. I don't quite understand the negativity of the users, unless they just want to be contrarian.What you have in this film begins with perfect performances by Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner. Jennifer Lawrence is very good, but just a bit over the top. She's the only one where you ever "see" the acting. The others - as great as they are - disappear into their characters, especially Bale.The overall direction of the plot is constrained by the fact that the movie is loosely based on the ABSCAM sting of the late 70s. However, if you remember the news from that time, it was a very controversial operation. Even many members of the law enforcement community believed that the FBI crossed the line into entrapment. As a result, it is very natural that this movie about con-men helping the FBI con public officials into taking bribes has a wonderfully calculated unevenness. The line between good guy and bad guy is a lot less clear than the line between legal and illegal.A con is all about improv, and this movie feels like it. Great characters making it up as they go along. The classic con movie of all time, "The Sting", was beautiful for its ultimate sense of how well the plan was choreographed. The joy of American Hustle is that it doesn't feel choreographed at all - it feels natural, reactive. And that's brilliant filmmaking.

I was anxious to see this movie for many reasons... the cast, the story line, the plot, the hype, and the fun...Unfortunately, I was disappointed at every turn. The characters were under-developed. The story line was disjointed. The acting was mediocre. Jennifer Lawrence and Louis CK had the only good moments in the film and they were far and few between. Not one character was interesting. I was disconnected throughout.There were no surprises, no unusual twists, and virtually no entertainment. Perhaps I was expecting too much. But this movie left me more disappointed than most bad movies I've seen.So much so, in fact, when my 10 year daughter wanted to see Grudge Match, and I begrudgingly took her... I enjoyed that movie far more for what it was (not too serious, character development, and bad acting).

This movie, while containing decent acting performances for the most part, was difficult and just not very enjoyable to watch. It felt as though it was in love with itself and its whole depiction of 70s east coast disco Guido "culture" when in fact it was just an empty, pointless piece of bombast not half as clever as it thought it was. It felt fake, contrived and half-baked from the first scene to the last, and as others have noted you just didn't care one bit about anyone on screen.The performances were decent except for the lead FBI guy (sorry but neither his screen nor real name is worth looking up) who tended to overact. But ultimately the poor plotting & pacing and the cliché ridden visuals made this one I wish I would have missed; if there was ever a movie that proves how useless so-called professional critics are, this is it.

"Some of this actually happened."From this first inter-title, David O. Russell's new crime comedy-drama American Hustle (2013) promised two and a half hours of the twisted, the practically anarchic, but most especially, the absolutely absurd - and in the best way possible. Despite its late arrival to the Oscar scene (along with Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street) and its being overshadowed by Steve McQueen's long-awaited 12 Years a Slave, American Hustle proves worthy of every nomination and accolade to date and lives up to its enormous hype. It is one of the best films to hit cinemas in years.American Hustle - based on the true story of the FBI ABSCAM operation - follows conman Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) and con-woman Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) after they are forced to work for wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). As they con their way through the story "to survive," the audience joins them, dragged into a world of power schemes that is as lethal as it is intoxicating.If the subject matter doesn't scream Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990) (or even Mean Streets (1973), if you squint), the style most definitely does. American Hustle's narrative trajectory is almost reminiscent of Casino (1995) in its first person narrative, given from the perspectives of both Bale's Irving Rosenfeld and Adams' Sydney Prosser. Yet, it's no Scorsese in regards to cinematography - and definitely no Guillermo del Toro. From a first viewing, the camera placement and movement remains incredibly simplistic and unremarkable. The cinematography, therefore, simply acts as an enabler for the film's greatest aspects - namely the performances by the A-list cast, and its fantastic script and plot.The screenplay is simply sensational, creating a remarkable dynamic between both comedy and drama that is so rarely accomplished with films of this nature. Dramatic moments - including a screaming match between Irving and and his unstable wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) - are immediately followed by hilarious quips and creative dialog that left me gasping for air. Everything about the script is interconnected fluidly and cleverly and moments expressed in the film's infancy reappear later on with greater prominence and importance, all working together to create a story that comes full circle and completely encapsulates its overall themes of reinvention and survival. The story is fantastic, the writing superb - and the plot completely driven by its characters.Christian Bale, renowned for his dedication when it comes to a character's physicality, immediately astounds with a comb-over and beer belly in his interpretation of lead, Irving Rosenfeld. However, it's his rendition of Irving that truly startles. Bale cleverly crafts a man who, despite his conning nature, is honorable at heart and is uncomfortable with potentially destroying a good man with good intentions (Jeremy Renner's Carmine Polito). Bale could have gone over the top with Irving - he is, after all, a conman from the Bronx - but, instead, he opted for a more realistic, grounded character. It was a fantastic choice, and one that definitely adds to the story's growing tension and drama. This may perhaps be one of Bale's best films. Opposite Bale is Amy Adams, in arguably one of her best showings to date, as well. Her performance as cleverly deceptive Sydney Prosser (or Lady Edith Greensly, if you're on the wrong side of the desk) is punctuated by moments of severe sincerity and emotional turmoil. Adams' prowess as an actress is in top form, and she proves absolutely deserving of her nomination for Best Leading Actress at this year's Golden Globe awards.In almost a throwback to another Russell film, Silver Linings Playbook, Bradley Cooper plays uncontrollable FBI agent Richie DiMaso (slightly familiar to Paul Solitano in regards to his wild desperation), who is determined to prove himself as a worthy player to not only his department, but his mother and especially himself. Though not Cooper's best performance to date, American Hustle definitely shows off his stuff and solidifies his position as a powerful, talented actor in Hollywood.Jennifer Lawrence once again proves herself to be one of the most daring and talented young actresses in the business as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, Irving's unstable and uncontrollable wife. In a world of reinvention and masks, Rosenfeld is the only character who tries not to change ("I hate change. I think I'd die before I ever changed") and it shows through her erratic and sometimes violent behavior - perfectly executed by Lawrence. Simply put, after watching American Hustle, I threw my hands up in the air and exclaimed to a startled audience of moviegoers, "Just give her the Oscar now!"Jeremy Renner, though the only actor in American Hustle to not rack up a nomination at the Golden Globes for his performance as good-guy Carmine Polito - gave a solid performance. I could not see any other actor giving Carmine the sincerity and good-guy-politician, go-getter attitude he deserved. Keep an eye out for Renner in the future; that Hurt Locker nomination was just the beginning of what will be an award-stacked career, and American Hustle is a perfect stepping stone towards that future.If the acting - and pristine characterization - isn't any indication of what an incredible film American Hustle is, just take a look at the Golden Globe nods its received - Best Picture (Comedy or Musical), Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Lead Actor (Christian Bale), Best Lead Actress (Amy Adams), Best Supporting Actor (Bradley Cooper) and Best Supporting Actress (Jennifer Lawrence). And American Hustle proves incredibly deserving of every scrap of recognition that it's been getting.If you haven't heard about - or seen - American Hustle, please get yourself out from underneath whatever rock you've been under for the last six or seven months and stomp on over to your local cinema immediately. Also, tune into the Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 12, 2014, where it's sure to give 12 Years a Slave a run for its money!

In the late 1970s, while America was swinging to rock n roll, exposing all its flashy jewelery over plunging necklines and under unruly hairdos, a scandalous entrapment planned by the FBI threatened several political figures and rocked the nation in its most oddly alluring time. David Russell reunites his cast from his previous best movies including 'The Fighter' and 'Silver linings playbook' to tell us the story of con artists who are led by the FBI to trap bigger fish in an attempt to expose corruption at high levels. This highly fictionalized version of the Abscam sting by the FBI has some meaningful conversations, witty dialogue and glorious nonsense in its overlong narrative. In an era of resurgent wealth and dynamic lifestyles, success is achieved with compelling ambitions amidst increasing competitiveness, only through some hustle. Right through his childhood years of conning people for his father's business, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) used the guise of legitimate businesses such as dry cleaning to conceal his beguiling loan schemes. Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), initially suspicious of Irving's businesses, soon becomes his partner in bed and crime. Her fake identity as Lady Edith Greensly not only attracts investors lured by her supposed British financial contacts but also by her revealing attire. Soon enough however, the con-artist duo is in the grips of FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who intends to entrap a New Jersey Mayor along with several Congressmen. Aided by a wire operator and a bogus Sheikh Abdullah (Michael Pena) who was to provide the funds for the redevelopment, the hustling of mayor Carmine (Jeremy Renner) begins with Richie, Sydney and Irving hustling each other in the process. If that wasn't enough, Irving's loud mouthed, cleavage flashing housewife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) gets them all on the edge with her erratic outbursts and ignorance of the entrapment. This sexy looking inspiration of the Abscam operation lacks a fast-paced plot and intrigue that made other conman films such as 'Catch me if you can' and 'Argo', exciting movies. Loud characters protract several insipid sequences that outlast their importance from the script. The seriousness of the entrapment plot is often overshadowed with the digressed focus on the characters and their relationships and while this dilutes the story-telling, it isn't such a bad thing when you have such a talented cast. However, one can only go so far with just acting, good looks, sexy styles and 70s tunes. David Russell fails to engage the audience with a tight script and twists in a con-artist's story that are only few and far apart. Clearly, style over substance was his approach here with entertainment left solely upon the actors' talents. Christian Bale put on 40lbs for this movie. It isn't the first time he has transformed himself on-screen and won't be the last. This con-man draws a line on his wrong doing and hesitates on going too big with the plan. His love for Sydney grows through the movie but always comes second to his son's well being. Irving has everything likable about him, even his weirdly meticulous wig. His softer, more intelligent character is a sharp contrast to his unabashed wife. Jennifer Lawrence plays everything that is wrong and right with the film. Rosalyn can be a big mouth, whining incessantly and trying hard to prove her worthiness. But she can also be the one character whose presence just makes you nod in disbelief about what she will do next. That uncanny ability and its unpredictable deliverance is surely Lawrence's talent at work that doesn't fail to impress. Bradley Cooper is a hot-headed FBI agent whose ambition gets the better of him. There are many scenes where he clearly improvises, such as enacting Louis C.K.'s agent Thorsen and the epic moment when Sydney lays herself out on the table for him, he gets so close and simply can't handle it. The most striking aspect of Cooper's performance is that his character is so unconvincing. He is ambitious and he has the con-artists by their necks in his elaborate plan but he is still an amateur who is guided by instinct rather than experience. Jeremy Renner's Mayor Carmine shows his devotion to his city and while it took some major hustling to draw him into the plan, those interactions with Irving were quite a delight to watch. Amy Adams looks sensational and sizzles in the chemistry she builds with Irving and Richie. She portrays wit, grace and spontaneity as they adapt to changing scenarios during the sting operation and remains ever focused on the plan. Adams may not be as loud as Lawrence nor as multi-dimensional so to speak but her screen presence is equally alluring. David Russell hasn't showcased his fine talents in a script that needed to be funnier, wittier and tighter. The actors improvise on their greyish characters and provide more entertainment than the script possibly could. That certainly isn't the film-maker's achievement but he did choose the right cast that could pull that con off on the audience. Perhaps that is the year's biggest hustle from Hollywood that bends the audience into liking material that is portrayed to be far greater than it should be accorded for. Enjoy it for the gorgeous women, the committed actors and the stylish times but do not get ensnared in the hype surrounding this hustle. 6.701 on a scale of 1-10.

A lot of people are talking about the movie American Hustle being one of the top ten movies of 2013. The trailers would lead you to believe that this movie is some grand heist, something like an Oceans 11 and a Goodfellas combined. Do not be fooled.American Hustle was a long drawn out movie about people who like to claim to be monogamous, but who are in fact all morally corrupt. That's the heart of the movie. The whole sub-story about catching some corrupt congressmen, that plays such a minor role. It's a movie about shitty people.Maybe they have a great advertising campaign, but be assured that this movie is definitely NOT a classic. The movie had so much potential. It was just such a disappointment.

I tell you I don't even know where to begin in trying to explain this movie. We can start by saying it was extremely unusual and pretty much incomparable to any other film I have seen lately or ever. I couldn't figure out if I liked the movie and then when I figured out that I did like it and really started to enjoy it, I knew why. The actors did a phenomenal job. And normally that goes hand in hand with a really good story. But in this case it was.well unusual. The main story is goodthe stories within the main story arewell just not feel good situations. But even with that somewhat negative observation they were entertaining in their own right. Funky I know. Without giving anything away it revolves around a con man (Christian Bale) and his partner (Amy Adams) and a fed agent (Bradley cooper) in an unlikely partnership to catch other criminals. The stories within the story are various. And you feel multiple emotions throughout the movie. Some of the situations are a bit sleazy, and I don't mean sexually. I mean just plain doing the wrong things. But just when you get kind of turned off the scene turns into laughter. Again, because of the fantastic job of the actors and their portrayal of the characters. You feel excited one moment then intense the nextupsetthen laugh out laughingthen intense again. At the beginning of the movie you are like "What is the hype all about this movie?" but I tell you as the movie goes on you get more and more enthralled with the characters their side storiesthe absurdity of some of the situationsand again the intensity. Literally you don't know what to make of it when you get out of the moviebut one thing for sure you are glad that you saw it because after everything you really enjoyed it. I can't say it enough that the all of the actors, every one, did a fantastic job of portraying their characters and you go from laughing with themto laughing at them to having no respect for themto sympathizing with themand back to laughing with them and going through that circle of emotions several times throughout the movie. Christian Bale played a part that you have never seen him like this. Amy Adams was so sexy and smart and very intense at timesyou will love her. And again each and every actor bought their game to this movie. I will say one thing, if you go to this movie commit to seeing the whole thing because you may be tempted in the beginning to say "What the heck?", because I did. But even as I am writing this review I am thinking I will see it again when it is available to rent because I will enjoy the first quarter of the movie more the second time after I have learned to really love the characters. I give this movie the most unusual "B+".

"American Hustle" opens with the construction of an unfortunate hairpiece. A balding man looks in the mirror, works his comb-over before gluing his new hair in place. When the process is complete, the result looks – hey! – not so bad. It's quite an intricate process. The careful application of these fake follicles represents, in a not-so-subtle way, the methods and application of almost everything that will happen for the next two hours, it's all subterfuge. We are invited into the world of a group of con artists, some working together and some being scammed themselves. We see how they operate on their marks and on each other.The application of the script, like the hairpiece, is convincing too. Writer-director David O. Russell and co-screenwriter Eric Warren Singer have based their script on the FBI's famous ABSCAM operation of the late 70s in which several high-level politicians were caught in an elaborate bribery sting. Russell is bold enough to open the movie with a title card that tells us that "Some of this actually happened," which frees up the story to be juicy enough that it isn't hindered by keeping the facts straight (actually, they've put together a story that is infinitely more interesting than the real thing). Their script weaves together the most fascinating con game since George Roy Hill's "The Sting" and the most dizzying vortex of 70s polyester and butterfly collars since "Boogie Nights." None of this would mean anything, of course, if we didn't care about the characters, starting with Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale, the one with the hairpiece), a Brooklyn-born business man who has made his bones with a string a dry cleaning stores all around Long Island. It's all a front, of course, behind the scenes he dabbles in fake art and loan fraud. With a bowling ball-shaped stomach and unfortunate hair, this is Bale's best performance since his Oscar win for "The Fighter", playing a guy who excels at the con but can't keep his personal life together.His passage to the big time begins when he meets Syndey Prosser (Amy Adams), a sweet and sexy gal from Albuquerque who started as a stripper and has moved her way up the style ladder using a mixture of what she's got upstairs and up front. There's something vague about Sydney that we can't quite put our finger on. Most of her cons involve slipping into the persona of Lady Edith, a Brit with banking connections. Her alliance with Irving takes his con games to new heights. They become, not only partners in crime but also lovers despite the predicament of Irving's wife Roselyn (Jennifer Lawrence, a ball of passive-aggressive insecurity wrapped up in big hair and fake nails. She knows about his double-dealings, and has him by the you-know-what.So too, does FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper, sporting a very Brady perm), who nabs Irving and Sydney and employs them for a sting operation to catch congressmen taking bribes. What happens next cannot be revealed here. What has been revealed only serves as the set up. Each player has a role and must play his part, especially when part of the sting involves a meeting with a blood-thirsty gangster (Robert De Niro) who has skills they don't anticipate. De Niro is, of course, an old pro at these kinds of stories and brings a kind of scary tension to the proceedings.The performances here are brilliant. Bale make his unattractive character work by means of quick thinking and experience at the con. Cooper comes in on the game and gets addicted to the thrill, even putting his own career on the line. Lawrence, as she did last year in Russell's "Silver Linings Playbook", shows a new side of herself as an unstable woman who comes into the game with a dangerous heir of unpredictability. At several points, she stands on the edge of blowing the whole deal.But the best performance belongs to Amy Adams as a woman who understands the con game better than anyone else. You can always see her thinking, sizing people up, working the situation only moments before it is her turn at center stage. Moving from the persona of Sydney to Edith and back again, there are moments when we question whether she has forgotten which is real (are we being conned?). Adams' single best scene takes place in a quiet, almost whispered conversation as her two accents alternate in the same sentence. It is a remarkable moment that never feels like a stunt. It is worthy of another Oscar nomination.What is refreshing is that the movie never feels slicked out. Everyone has a story and therefore has massive flaws. They are damaged people before the con starts and aren't improved once it gets underway. Russell makes us care about these people; otherwise the script would just be all mechanics. You like these people despite what they are doing. They are placed into a movie that moves and vibrates with color and madness. The irony, of course, is that while they are busy risking their lives to steal money, they only have to wait five years for the Wall Street boom of the 1980s and they could take it legally.The soundtrack features songs from everybody from Donna Summer, to Duke Ellington to Steely Dan to Paul McCartney and Wings. The music plays as a Greek chorus, not just a period identifier. The music goads these disaffected people, all of whom are searching for something better, and are willing to risk their lives to get it.**** (of four)

'AMERICAN HUSTLE': Five Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director David O. Russell's new comedy/crime drama film (set in the 1970s) about a con man, and his partner, who are forced to work with a crazy FBI agent as part of a sting operation. It stars Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence and Cooper recently starred in O. Russell's 2012 hit 'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK' (which is my all time favorite movie) and Bale and Adams co-starred in his film before that 'THE FIGHTER'. Bale and Lawrence won Oscars for their parts (Cooper and Adams were nominated). Lawrence, Cooper and Bale are likely to be up for Academy Awards again this year (Lawrence is a frontrunner and a win would be back-to-back Oscars for her). The film is also a major Academy Awards contender itself (as is David O. Russell) and has received almost universally positive reviews. I love the film and think it deserves every bit of the hype and praise it's been getting!Christian Bale put on 40 lbs to play the role of Irving Rosenfeld (based on real life conman Melvin Weinberg). Rosenfeld was an intelligent and successful con-artist in 1978 when he met Sydney Prosser (Adams), a stripper who was also very good at the art of 'hustling people'. The two teamed up and became lovers, despite the fact that Rosenfeld was married and had an adopted son named Danny (played by Danny and Sonny Corbo). Danny was the son of Irving's dimwitted wife Rosalyn (Lawrence). All went well for Irving and Sydney until they were caught in the act by an undercover FBI agent named Richard DiMaso (Cooper). DiMaso forced them to help him bust four bigger con-artists and Mayor Carmine Polito (Renner, who's character is based on Angelo Errichetti) got caught in their hustle as well. Adams' character Sydney Prosser is also based on Evelyn Knight, DiMaso is based on Anthony Amoroso, Jr. and Rosalyn is based on Cynthia Marie Weinberg.Lawrence (my favorite actress) is a scene stealer in the movie (once again) and she lights up the screen every time she comes on it, especially the first time she appears, when she really takes the film up a notch! What's surprising is that the film continues to stay at the same energetic level even when Lawrence is off screen (which is a large part of the movie, given her part is a smaller supporting role). For the first 20 minutes or so I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy the film that much but it really picked up in pace (and entertainment value) and I think that's largely due to O. Russell's flawless direction. While the movie is not quite as classic as 'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK' it is O. Russell's most impressive directing job to date (in a visual and stylistic way at least). The performances are all excellent as well, especially Lawrence and Cooper (who are once again the two craziest characters in the movie). Bale and Adams make great straight men (and women) though; Adams looks more beautiful and acts better than she ever has before and Bale really went all out gaining the weight he did to play this unattractive balding criminal. It's really impressive how O. Russell has became such an 'actor's director' (especially given the history he has with actors he's worked with in the past, like George Clooney and Lily Tomlin). His script is brilliant as well (based on a screenplay by Eric Warren Singer, which is in turn based on historical events involving the FBI ABSCAM operation of the 70s and early 80s). It's yet another amazing masterpiece from David O. Russell and one of the best films of the year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDElhat3XPM

This gets a pass, but only because I didn't feel like walking out after 20 minutes, like I normally do when I make the mistake of going to see a movie. Some are comparing American Hustle to Goodfellas - this comparison is plain redundant. The problem is that it has none of the panache and (controlled) manic energy of the Scorcese classic, therefore its attempt at pastiche is a failure, and it ends up just being painfully derivative. However, this does not prevent the director from indulging in a woefully egotistical self-reference regarding a forgery of a Rembrandt painting. The line goes something like "Who is the master, the painter of the original, or the forger?", ie "Who is the master here, Scorsese....or ME?" (!!!). The use of music is too deliberate, and falls easily into the 'soundtrack in search of a movie' category. We're also a bit tired of over the top depictions of 1970's fashion, hairstyles, etc. Overall,a rather klunky piece of self-indulgence.

Acting was great, but the story was about as exciting as watching paint dry.2+ hours that could be better spent, don't waste your time with this movie and go see Frozen instead.I'm glad I didn't take the whole family to see this.I felt like the movie just droned on and on.I hate it when I have to take a pee in the middle of a movie usually, but I had no problem leaving during the movie to relieve myself...didn't feel like I missed a thing when I sat back down.I'm actually surprised that anybody gave this a good review. When a movie is as hyped as this one, it's usually not a good thing as was the case here.

As a massive film fan, my tastes are very wide-ranging, but I do have a problem with musicals. Nevertheless I was happy to take the opportunity of a private viewing of "Les Misérables" at the London office of distributors Universal - the day after the London première and a month before the UK release - because of the outstanding success of the original stage show (a run of 27 years with a total audience of over 60 million) and the surprising and impressive cast list (Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne). The showing was introduced by producer Eric Fellner of Working Title who underlined the commercial challenge of making a film in which all the dialogue is sung and the themes are so political and praised director Tom Hooper ("The King's Speech") for his insistence that every take was sung live.The two main characters are presented in the opening seconds of a sweeping introductory sequence: the police inspector Javert (Crowe) and the prisoner 24601 Jean Valjean (Jackman) in post-revolutionary France. There follows over two and half hours with barely a spoken word which will not appeal to all cinema-goers, but the production is a triumph with Cameron Mackintosh's musical opened up by dramatic shooting on Pinewood's brand new Richard Attenborough stage and some historic English locations. If Crowe and especially Jackman are excellent, Hathaway - who lost 25 pounds and most of her hair for the role - is outstanding as the destitute Fantine and Cohen and Carter almost steal the show as the comical Thénardier innkeepers.I'm not sure how long it will take for "Les Misérables" to recoup its investment cash- wise, but it's going to win award after award and rightly so.

As a fan of the musical, I had not to be disappointed with this adaptation and I wasn't! I had the opportunity of watching it at the premiere in Leicester Square in London, with all the huge actors, the director, musical creator's, etc. It was really exciting, the actors sing better than I expected, and all the photography added to the musical perfectly complete it for an unforgettable experience. I can't tell anything bad. Anne Hathaway is very good, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen or Hugh Jackman. The musical is fantastic. The movie: terrific!

This film is amazing. Absolutely incredible. I don't understand what people are saying about pacing issues, I thought it flowed beautifully. The changes made worked very well. And I didn't think there was any weak link in the cast. I honestly loved Russell as Javert. He wasn't traditional by any means, but what he did worked. The cgi was not the best, but it kind of created this fantastical other world while still being realistic and grounded. So many of the acting choices were brilliant and subtle. For example Jackman ever so slightly altered his voice with his characters aging, which I thought was brilliant. There is no negative thing to say about this movie. However, I do see why a critic may not like it. It's not a critic movie. There isn't a lot of impressive violence, crazy camera shots, etc. the things critics seem to love. It's more grounded in the performances and the story, which it tells extremely well. The only thing I can point out (because I saw it with my boyfriend who knows nothing about the story) there are two or three slightly confusing plots for those who aren't familiar with Les Mis. But they are either explained later on or not important enough to dwell on. Anyways, that's my rant. Needless to say I will be seeing it many many times and cannot wait for the DVD so I can own it and watch it even more.

I went to an awards screening of Les Miserables and left the cinema speechless. Tom Hooper's direction and the cinematography, costumes, art design and editing are nothing short of genius.Hooper's idea to have the actors sing live really brings a deeper emotion to the film not seen in other movie musicals. Hugh Jackman is absolutely incredible as Jean Valjean and carries the film with spectacular grace. Anne Hathaway is magnificent in her fleeting role as Fantine - the film's sequence in which she goes on a downward spiral is one of the it's best moments, and her ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HEARTFELT rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' will win her the Oscar by itself.Also, a great supporting turn from newcomer Samantha Barks as the heartbroken Eponine (look out for her waist - it's absolutely tiny!), who is sure to be shot into stardom. Eddie Redmayne, Russell Crowe and Aaron Tveit are also good, and there's some great comedy relief from Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.It will leave you laughing, crying, and feeling inspired. A great watch, sure to win some major awards this year! 10/10!

Wow! - Les Misérables is seriously Outstanding! Seriously Amazing! If this doesn't win a "Best Picture Oscar" - Nothing should!! Hugh Jackman - Oscar!!! (he made me cry!) Anne Hathaway - Oscar!! (shemade me cry!) Samantha Barks - Oscar!! (she made me cry!) Eddie Redmayne - Oscar!! (he made me cry!) ...and then we move onto Russell Crowe - if only they had enough time to re-shoot / edit out / destroy all existence of him ever being near this movie! (he Didn't make me...think he could act or sing!) The entire movie is non-stop and with them singing live while filming you can really feel the authenticity of their singing! When they move into some of the big "torch" song - you just want to give a standing ovation!

Outstanding : Anne Hathaway's Fantine. Twenty minutes of screen presence at the beginning, and she hovers over the whole story until the very last frame. Her heartbreaking rendering of "I dream a dream" is a milestone in acting/singing. Outstanding : The bombastic soundtrack, music and lyrics altogether, splendidly performed live and re-orchestrated. Good : Chris Dickens and Melanie Oliver's editing. Especially when songs are performed by three or more protagonists. Missed opportunity : Why on earth does Hugh Jackman turn the requiem-like "Bring him home" into a high-pitched exercise in hysterical yelling ? Bad : Russel Crowe's Javert. His eyes and his voice play two different characters. Plus, he never really seems comfortable in his much too slim outfits. Bad : Amanda Seyfried's Cosette. Much too cheesy, she doesn't match the overall realistic approach. Awful : Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter's Thenardiers. Their slapstick duets, along with horrendous makeup, absurdly grimacing faces and graceless body language will prompt the use of the "skip" button of the remote when Blu-ray time comes. Awful : Tom Hooper's direction. A few exceptions aside, the endless Terry Gilliam-like tracking shots and distorted closeups not only kill the intended lyrical scope of the show and almost ruin its emotional impact, but inflict the kind of headache you can "expect" from an incompetently converted 3D flick.

If you don't like musicals or are not a fan of the through-sung style, skip this movie. I will only irritate you (much like bombastic action films torture me).But if you're a fan of Les Miserables or musicals in general, then you're in for a treat.Many people have criticized Tom Hooper's direction. For me, I just think these people have no idea what Hooper is doing, and do not realize the effects of his work (with the help of Danny Cohen's marvelous cinematography). The Dutch angles work very well, especially during the Lovely Ladies sequences -- Hooper skillfully created a surrealistic, nightmarish Paris for Fantine (and the audience), making us feel queasy and uncomfortable and horrified, in some ways, for Fantine. We have to realize that this is not a videotaped version of the stage play or concert. This is a movie. Hooper said that he wanted to create an extreme/heightened realism that is on the verge of being surrealistic. I for one applaud his choice and I think it works beautifully for the movie.Same with the close-ups. They created the kind of intimacy you won't get on stage, and also provided the opportunities for the actors to do their work. The result is amazingly personal, intense. Obviously it works better for some actors than others (that's why we're thinking of giving Anne Hathaway the Oscar, not Amanda Seyfried), but over all, it's a great cinematic choice -- together with live recording... it's emotionally powerful.I do have some gripes: certain hand-held camera shots could have been avoided or stabilized -- there is really no need for them. The barricade scenes can be somewhat chaotic and rushed. Unfortunately Hooper has to work in the confine of the musical structure, and the story is already almost 3 hours long. Also, they had to cut or shorten some songs to fit the time frame - to those who have seen the show 30 times, it could be unsettling.The performances are excellent. Hugh Jackman carries most of the movie with dignity and amazing versatility. He may not be the best singer in the world to play Valjean, but he IS Valjean on screen -- his voice is characterized to fit Valjean perfectly. His "What Have I Done" is a revelation of what his song-and-dance man who is best known for Wolverine can do.Anne Hathaway deserves all the accolades she is getting. Her "I Dream a Dream" will become the de facto performance for those who will play Fantine in the future.Eddie Redmayne is a surprise -- I know the actor can act, but I had no idea that he could sing so well. And that he could sing and act at the same time with such grace and charm. It's not an easy thing to accomplish.Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit have done Les Miserables on stage before, and they are excellent in the film. Many stage actors can't transition to the screen, but these two have succeeded (with a lot hard work, no doubt).Amanda Seyfried is one of the weakest links in the movie. She is, of course, lovely as the adult Cosette (Isabelle Allen is excellent as young Cosette), even though the part is underwritten (in the film or on stage). Her singing voice is okay, but not as strong as expected, and I find her performance somewhat one dimensional. But she and Redmayne have great chemistry together, and that's a good thing.Russell Crowe also is the weak link. He is a good actor and I think he does his best with this role. But his rock-opera voice is jarringly different from the rest and he just stands out like a sore thumb. However, in the course of the movie he grew on me. In his final scenes I can see the great acting (it's all in the eyes, people!). So while I can't say he's the best Javert ever, I'll give him a pass.The supporting cast and background actors are all excellent.The production is rich and wonderful with great sets, great cinematography, great costumes. Is it perfect? No. I haven't seen one single film this year that is "perfect." I don't think that exists. At the end of the day (pun intended), Les Miserables is all about the music, the characters, and the emotions, and this film delivers. I expect many award nominations for this film.

To even attempt a movie version of the musical "Les Misérables" may be an act of insanity. There are few musical productions more beloved or more memorized, and so the end result is either going to be success or a colossal failure. Seeing the finished product, it can be confidently said that director Tom Hooper, brings together a full-blooded production that is not shy. He pulls out all the stops, takes no prisoners and creates a big, lavish, garish, but always entertaining adaptation of a musical that leaves subtlety smoldering in the dust. Is it sad? Is it melancholy? Is it full of grimness and death? You bet, but hey, it's Les Misérables.The story, for the uninitiated, begins in 1815 on the day that Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is to be paroled after serving 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread. By law of the land, he is to be on parole for the rest of his natural life. By law of the destiny, Valjean finds his place in the eyes of God after being shown kindness by a priest. Frustrated with the tyranny of his bondage, Valjean tears up his parole notice and goes on the lam. He knows that the stone-hearted Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) will never give up searching for him, but he doesn't know that this defiant gesture will change the fate of both men.Years later, we catch up with Valjean who has taken the assumed name Monsieur Madeleine and is running a factory that makes rosaries. Working in the factory is the sad-eyed Fantine (Anne Hathaway) who is working to feed her illegitimate daughter. A mishap reveals her shame and she is thrown out in the street by the shop foreman. A whim of destiny keeps Valjean just out of earshot of what has happened to the young woman, who is eventually forced into prostitution. By an act of kindness, Valjean finds himself adopting Fantine's daughter Cosette (played as a child by Isabelle Allen and as an adult by Amanda Seyfried). This will be the pattern of Valjean's life. Once the priest shows him kindness, it opens a door in his heart and he finds that the kindness that he shows to others comes back to him when he needs it most. The pattern of the story is centered on two separate figures, Valjean who sees kindness as a balance to the natural order, and Javert who is blinded by his devotion to duty. Their duality is seen appropriately against the backdrop of Paris'1832 June Rebellion in which angry citizens rise up against the French army.Of course, all the elements of the story are told through music – non-stop music. Even the speech is a form of talk-singing and Hooper was smart to cast well-known actors who can actually sing. Jackman, of course, is a Tony Award winner for "The Boy from Oz" and imbues Valjean with a kind of good-heartedness that comes from within. Russell Crowe is less schooled but has been in music since 1980. Amanda Seyfried as Cosette has a bird-like lilt to her brief musical interludes. Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter provide the much needed comic relief as the greedy Monsieur and Madame Thénardier. Also, along the edges of the film, is an unforgettable performance by 22 year-old Samantha Barks who has been in the stage production. She plays the sad-eyed Eponine, the Thénardier's daughter who gets caught up in the rebellion.They are all wonderful, but no one can outclass Anne Hathaway who, with limited screen time, brings to light the disparity of being a poor woman in 19th century France. Cast out in the street for the crime of having a child out of wedlock, she is forced to sell her hair before being forced into prostitution. There, amid the squalid Hell, that is the den of the hopeless and the wretched she emotes the power of Schönberg's "I Dreamed a Dream"; of a life that now feeds her broken promises and poisoned dreams. For six unbroken, unforgettable minutes, Tom Hooper's camera holds steady on her withered face as she cries out for the once-golden promise of a life that has crumbled . Hathaway has always been a good actress but here she reveals a depth and a range that are beyond anything we ever expected. It's a revelation.That moment is a showstopper, but the rest of the production never slouches either. You walk in asking whether director Tom Hooper scored a masterwork, or a sour note? The answer to that question may rest with you. Your enjoyment may depend on your personal history with this production. What can be confidently reported is that this is probably the best adaptation of this musical that one could hope for outside of a concert hall. It is rousing, beautifully mounted and wonderfully well-acted production that entertains and does the job quite well.

What an innovative film!Contrary to one of the reviews which canned everything about the movie from the plot to the actors' singing voices to camera angles (by someone who, to me, is obviously not familiar with the live theater productions of this musical nor it appears the he has ever been to any), I find this movie version is a a state-of-the-art capture of one the world's great musicals for the cinema screens!The live singing is superb, showing the fragility (and flaws) of every performer ... and that's what a live-performance is all about! This movie captured a live theater production on screen for all cinema goers who never had the chance to enjoy a live theater production!Kudos to everyone involved! A must-see for all! And a must-buy for those who wish to have a copy of this masterpiece for a keepsake!

I've read the other user reviews that have been written so far (as of Dec. 17) and I think some people don't really understand what they are reviewing. It's a film adaptation of a hugely successful stage musical. For those who don't like the pacing or the storyline or characters, they didn't develop them past how they are written in the stage version. Stage musicals don't have as much development as film, but that's not to say there's no development what-so-ever. It's just differently in musicals.That being said: Hugh Jackman does an amazing job as Jean ValJean. While I don't agree with all the vocal techniques he used, he makes the character his own; which is a huge undertaking considering the originator of the role, Colm Wilkinson, plays the Bishop of Digne.Russell Crowe grew on me as time went on, I personally prefer Philip Quast of the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast version of the show.Amanda Seyfried's voice is plain awful and she was used solely on the fact that she's somewhat of a name. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also give underwhelming performances and are cast based off of name recognition only.Anne Hathaway is way too dramatic for this role. Her voice is nice, but her physical emotion overpowers the emotion created by Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil. Same goes for Eddie Redmayne's rendition of "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables." The ones who nail their characters are Aaron Tveit and Samantha Barks, which is no surprise since they come from theatre backgrounds. They truly understand what it takes to break down a song and truly emote through the music.As stated in my one line summary: it's not awful, but not great. If you go into this expecting just a film or expecting the stage version you'll be disappointed. It's an adaptation, a flawed one at that. However, it is nice to see that musicals are slowly starting to make it back into the mainstream.So thank you Tom Hooper for doing this project and having the cast sing live. It's just too bad that your cinematography kills the emotion that Schonberg and Boublil's stage version has mastered for the last 27 years.

Jean Valjean: "I stole a loaf of bread. My sister's child was close to death, and we were starving." Javert: "And you will starve again unless you learn the meaning of the law!" Just as I stood at the end of the stage production of Les Miserables, I stood in my home after watching a screener copy. I was, however, concerned that I would have nothing "critical' to say about director Tom Hooper's lush film version, filled with first-rate actors believable crowds, and singing befitting non-opera types in a people's opera. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), mayor of Paris in the first part of the 19th century, promises dying prostitute Fantine (Anne Hathaway) to take care of her daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried). He has been eluding the tireless policeman, Javert (Russell Crowe), after breaking parole for the crime of stealing a loaf of bread, for which he served 19 years. It's not so much the melodrama that grabs me as the inspired music that has discernibly distinct and luscious melodies and a book that straightforwardly tells story and reveals character. Jackman, Hathaway, and Crowe are competent singers, and the better for not being opera stars, who would have compromised the Everyman feel of the musical. For an almost three hour show, Hooper and writer Claude-Michel Schonberg keep the action moving from Javert and Valjean in a battle of wits and the youths fomenting a revolution right outside the windows. For comic relief, Sacha Baron Cohen as Thénardier and Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Thénardier run a comical whore house and do quite well as pickpockets. At times, their antics are so opposite the grand action outside as to be almost irritating. Les Mis was a thrill on stage; it is a joy on screen as the 19th century comes alive with the poor struggling against the rich and the noble, poor or rich, miserable.

Last night I got the chance to watch the sneak peek of this movie and couldn't wait till it was over with. First, lets get to some things that I did like about this movie and one of those is the set designs. The scale and detail of some of the sets did well to set the mood. Also, Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are absolutely delightful in this movie. I felt like they were the only actors who had any energy. The main reason why I did not like this movie is that I do not think Hugh Jackman can sing. Every time he came on I would start to cringe. The rest of cast were just there. I did not care about their story line.

Note-I had not had my French press coffee and croissant yet when I wrote this, so eloquent it ain't. Enjoy my review! I saw it last night at a screening in Philly. Hundreds of people showed up and got turned away, many were furious. Complete chaos. A woman who thought I worked at the theater let out a string of cuss words at me.I don't really feel like giving a detailed, well-written review, but I thought it was marvelous and look forward to seeing it again.The pros-Eddie Remayne - passionate performance, and worthy of recognition. Amanda Seyfried really makes Cosette something special. The young Cosette was a perfect match for Seyfried, and that little girl gave a lot of great moments (especially in the Thenardier Waltz of Treachery). Cohen and Carter were wonderful and their final moment was the funniest part of the film. The scenes in Paris to the finale were the highlights. The kid who played Gavroche was fantastic and I finally like that character now. I would love to see that kid get some recognition. Javert's final moment was unexpected and frighting, very powerful. Also, loved the factory ladies. Anne Hathaway I actually enjoyed at the end more than the beginning. Honestly, I found the film to be straight-forward and relatively gimmick free. Many plot holes and wrinkles in the stage show were ironed out here, such as the students' complete isolation at the barricades, the business with Marius' ring, Valjean's superhuman strength as he drags Marius through the sewers etc. And finally, Hugh Jackman deserves an Oscar nomination. A win would be great but I doubt that will happen, but you're nuts if you think he won't get a nod.The cons-Poor Russell Crowe. Where was that Gladiator? This guy is a great actor and has given some great performances, but he was just not even trying. I'm disappointed because I know he was capable of something much, much better. But he wasn't there. And Javert is so crucial, it just sinks the story a bit to not having him be a part of the story. The scenes up until Paris seemed to drag a bit for me (the heart and soul of Les Mis are always the barricade scenes). Master of the House was a great scene but a little restrained, not the showstopper it could have been. The freedom of the actors to dictate the underscoring is very jarring at first, but you get used to it and accept it and it works and makes the movie better.Overall, there was surprisingly too much restraint and realism for an epic film musical. I mean, Hopper could have made it a little more fun-you can't take a musical too deadly serious. I appreciate Hooper's desire to pull back, but there were moments he could have really packed a punch, but instead retreated.Overall, I thought it was marvelous. The movie is NOT better than the stage version, and the stage version is NOT better than the movie, if that makes sense. They both work well together as companion pieces. The tugging at the heartstrings that made the stage show so popular is still there tugging on your heartstrings in the movie theater. I haven't loved a film musical so much since Chicago - and honestly, I think although Chicago is a much, much better work of art than Les Mis, I was more frustrated with Chicago the film than Les Mis the film. Interestingly, Russell Crowe and Richard Gere were the weak links in both these movies.I don't know how this will fare with Oscar nominations or critics, but I will say that this movie is going to be a gigantic hit with repeated viewings. It makes you want to see it again because it is such a gigantic, detailed movie. Tween girls will fall in love with Marius and songs like "On My Own" all over again and Les Mis the musical is going to have an enjoyable second life.Ultimately, it's a story about Hope, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you miss that when you see Les Mis, you probably miss out on hope a lot.

Amazing.... Les Misérables is a powerful story of redemption, grace and love. I recommend the book (abridged... Hugo does go on) as well as the 1998 version (Liam Neeson is a great Valjean). I could not say enough good things about this production. The performers were excellent, the sets and effects were great and the direction kept things moving. If this were on the stage Anne Hathaway's 'I Dreamed a Dream' would have stopped the show... I wanted to stand a cheer. Hugh Jackman deftly guided us through Valjeans anger, anguish, despair, love and honor. Tom Hoopers decision to have the actors sing on set instead of miming a recording made the experience more emotional.

An all star cast, a classic musical, and new innovations make for an astounding rendition of Les Miserables. Unlike most musical films, all the singing was filmed and recorded live, and it made a difference. There was a passion and emotion present that I have felt so deeply and personally only a few times before. Crowe and Jackman were both fantastic throughout the film, and Anne Hathaway performed the most moving version of "I Dreamed A Dream" that I have heard. Overall, the acting was well done and I only had a few issues with characters. Sacha Baron Cohen brings a sense of raunchy humor and disrespect to a serious and emotional film. I am disappointed in him being cast, as he ruined some potentially moving scenes. The cinematography was not traditional, and there were moments where it distracted from the story. Many shots and scenes were very well done though, and besides a few shots, the cinematography was intriguing. I don't know how to sum it up, so I'll just say this: if you are a fan of Broadway, or past Les Mis films and soundtracks, this film is for you.

This movie makes history as being the musical with the most out of focus shots on record.The trailers for this film are careful to present the visual style of the film as looking as big and classical(David LEANish) as they can. What they are hiding is almost a Blair Witch like style that director Hooper uses. Most of the film, when it doesn't involve some CGI work, is shot with a very unstable and frequently out of focus in large or very large closeup with the actors staring into the shaky camera while it goes it and out of focus randomly. Anne Hathaway's big solo runs as one long take this way, it's completely distracting and for a movie that runs this long to have the same approach to every scene is dull. Hooper also, as he did in the better-overall THE KING'S SPEECH, also will put an actor way off in the lower corner and/or against the edge of a the frame making you stare at at wall or dead or out of focus background and have to force yourself to watch the performer while your eye keeps getting drawn off of them to the majority of the frame that is meaningless. He also in ED WOOD like fashion will cut to wide shots when you least expect them only to have someone eventually come into the frame. It's like he's interesting in anything but what's currently going on. The movie is mostly very well sung and acted, with the only problem being that Jackman's upper register of his voice gets very pinched and nasally. He gives a good performance but the music isn't written for his best tones and it falls way short of the excellent singing of "23601's in the recent Broadway revival. Another thing that makes these closeups off putting is the overly dirty faces and teeth or almost everyone. One the big screen the fake grunge on each tooth is as big as your TV at home you can't help but go, "Wow their breath must stink."Hooper really almost ruins the film with his approach, he has no feel for an epic and sometimes doesn't seem to know how to cover action of the scene or of the overall story. The opening with the gang of prisoners trying to pull the boat into dry dock is a good example. The scene and song goes on and on the boat never seems to move then suddenly we cut and it's later and the boat is in place already. Wasn't the scene about them pulling in the boat? Why just skip that part.Les Miserables was not a big dancing type musical but there's even less of that here. The film's approach to everyone singing live is the one good idea Hooper has but he even sort of spoils that in the big final number where it's clear they aren't singing live. He has a massive scene of everyone singing but also, as he does, cuts almost randomly to giant close ups and we don't hear that characters voice at all,only still the whole chorus instead. For a musical the editing has no sense of timing certainly it rarely cuts on the beat. Additionally each music number feels like it's waiting for applause as it just turns silent and then lingers on the otherwise over scene. You almost feel a stage-like "time to move all the scenery around" In many other moments the music will swell to some huge dramatic climax of moment and the camera will lazily be one some random close up of some extra or unimportant detail.Don't sit up close in the film or, like BLAIR WITCH, you're likely to get motion sickness and end up rubbing your eyes from the strain of fighting against the out of focus approach. Don't get me wrong here BLAIR WITCH used this approach and it worked for rather than against the material. It also works great in the BOURNE movies. But it takes skill to time your shaky camera and "bad" framing in a way that it propels the film and the editors/cameraman/ and director don't have that level of skill to make it work here.One more thing of interest and a first is that the MASTER OF THE HOUSE number as sung by BORAT/COHEN is sung with a french accent and is quite funny. The rest of the time however that character and many others speak in a low English accent--which is true to the stage version--but of course makes no sense as the whole story is set and about pure French people. An odd thing. On stage you just sort of buy it but as a film being much more obviously in real world... Several of "The Master's" songs from the show are cut from the film version.Although the film does show a number of blacks(I won't say African Americans because this is France) realistically mixed into the crowd scenes, but a major supporting role, always sung by a person of color in the stage show, is given to yet another Brit White Gal. Odd. Especially as there are plenty of great black actress singers who could have played and sung the role.Hooper Hooper, what were you thinking? It's nice to have new approaches to material but this one doesn't work and it should be about expressing the material not reminding the audience that this director's vision is always there by shaking around being just a bit out of sync with the actor's movements and drifting in and just as often out of focus.Notice, just as a final focus problem, all of the end credits are nice and sharp until the credit roll starts and then all then are out of focus because the font and speed of the roll is too much.The whole thing on that level just speaks to inexperience. Hard to believe but true.

Let me preface this entire review with some important notes about myself. I really like musicals. Quite a bit. From an early age all the way to the present, I loved the excitement of the stage and had the pleasure of seeing shows like Phantom of the Opera, The Producers, The Lion King, Billy Elliot, Mary Poppins, Wicked, Jersey Boys, and many other shows as the national productions came to Chicago. But as far as music and sure beauty, Les Misérables was always my favorite musical. I was thrilled to see it last month when it came to the Cadillac Theatre in Chicago, and was looking forward to seeing Tom Hooper's film adaptation of the musical for quite some time.This is all extremely important because Les Misérables is a film that will not resonate with everyone. This is a fact and is not a fault of the cast, crew, or director. The musical was not received well critically when it first premiered, and I would imagine this film could suffer the same problem from film critics this holiday season. It is a deep, draining, and long drama that does not give your emotions a rest from song to song and heartbreak to heartbreak. You should know that when seeing a film titled Les Misérables anyway, but in case you weren't reading the clues, it is heavy.However, it will not receive a negative review from myself. On the contrary, I can do nothing but praise the film for being a bold, beautiful, and moving adaptation of what I consider to be one of the best musicals ever made. Claude-Michel Schönberg's absolutely gorgeous music transfers brilliantly to the silver screen as the power and emotion in melodies of "I Dreamed a Dream" "One Day More" "On My Own" and "Bring Him Home" will bring chills and tears to many an audience member seeing Les Misérables this holiday season.Les Misérables is originally a novel by French writer Victor Hugo. The story follows Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a man who spent 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread for his dying nephew and trying to escape his capture. Upon his release from prison, he tries to begin a new life when he is taken in by a kind hearted bishop (played in the film by the original Jean Valjean, Colm Wilkinson). Leaving Jean Valjean behind, he is constantly hunted down by the police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) that was one of his original guards in prison. Making a new and fulfilling life for himself, Valjean is constantly haunted by his past while trying to make right the life he lives. Eventually he becomes mayor of a town and owns a factory. Here he encounters Fantine (Anne Hathaway), a young girl who turned to prostitution to pay for her child when she was fired by the foreman of Valjean's factory. Promising to care for her child when Fantine is on her death bed, Valjean devotes his life to the young Cosette (played in her adult period by Amanda Seyfried) and begins a new life with her in Paris.The story continues following the life of Valjean and Cosette while bringing in the lives of a crass landlord (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his wife (Helena Bonham Carter), their daughter Eponine (Samantha Barks), and members of a revolution looking to change the way the people of France are treated by the government. The second act is filled with an explosive battle, a young love story, and the constant fight between Valjean and Javert.As I stated above, the film is quite lengthy and complex and is on a pretty phenomenal scale. Being a musical that premiered over 25 years ago, we can understand why it took such a great deal of time for any director to even attempt to bring this epic to the screen. And Tom Hooper should be applauded for not only being bold enough to be the man to helm this project, but for also making some creative choices that could have ended tragically for this adaptation.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/les-miserables/

When it comes to converting a famous stage musical to a movie, I expect the outcome to be more than what the stage version provides - great lyrics, great melodies, and great staging wrapped into a great experience. Otherwise, see the stage version! So I'm unhappy to report Hooper and company fail to fully embrace what movies can do and instead give us a half-breed of musical and film.The opening number's awful CGI rendition seems intentionally lame as if to say we know a movie scene in 2012 could be more but we choose not to provide that experience. Same with the later rooftop scene with Javert's singing to the stars.My distraction as to what this effort is adding to Les Miz's legacy was then compounded by the wait for opening credits which never came. Finally, you realize the curtain has lifted and what we are seeing is an overblown stage production except this time retakes were allowed! Geez, handed the opportunity to adapt possibly the greatest modern musical into a movie and that's what we get?To its credit as a filmed stage production, I've always suffered thru "Master of the House" but not this time. Clever business, excellence in details, and great acting/singing by the three name duo of Cohen and Carter made that number finally worthy of its place in the show.While much is made of the mega-stars, for my money Samantha Barks as adult Éponine shines brightest with her singing.The most flattering thing my wife and I could say about the movie was we finally heard more lyrics in an understandable manner than ever before. There were a few chorus numbers with unintelligible voices and as always the duets and trios are near impossible to discern. If you don't know the lyrics, relax and enjoy the harmonious sounds of voices and orchestra together.Warning to parents: The young rascal in the revolution dies a harsh death by gunfire; an untimely choice by Hooper given the recent slaughter of innocent school kids. Why was I not surprised the most movie-like aspect of the film was the gore and dying? When it came to violence, Hooper suddenly embraces film's ability to focus, zoom, and make you confront the images on the screen.

...this one was really great entertainment, from the start to the very end. I think that both Anne Hathaway, for her incredible rendition of "I dreamed a dream" and Hugh Jackman, for the whole performance - but in particular for the starting scenes when Jean Valjean is still a prisoner - deserve an Oscar. By far, the most stunning performances I saw in years. Helena Bonham Carter was as good as ever and Eddie Redmayne (who I didn't know before this movie) a great surprise too. The only thing that I hated (and I wasn't the only one, judging from the comments of the other viewers around me) was Russell Crowe: weak and totally inexpressive voice. I would have given 10 out of 10 with a less "misérable" choice for Javert's role.

This film tells the story of a man who stole a piece of bread to feed his sister's child. He was in jail for almost twenty years. He lives a fugitive life, complicated by his pledge to help raise the daughter of an unfortunate woman."Les Miserables" is a wonderful film. Right from the start, it captures every viewer's hearts. It makes three hours seem like ten minutes. It is so touching and so poignant that everyone in the cinema cried like a baby. Throughout the film, the sound of tissue packets opening and closing was a permanent addition to the soundtrack. For me, I just let my t shirt be drenched in tears, as if i have had a strenuous workout. I thought the Anna Hathaway soliloquy was already with the ticket price, but masterpiece scenes like that keep on coming. I was dehydrated from all the water I lost from tears by the end of the film.It's amazing how the film can take us through every emotions there is. From the relentless struggle for existence, the the uplifting revolutionary spirit, the fatherly love and the encompassing integrity of Jean. Everything keeps emotions high, and love i find my tears literally in a freefall mode without even knowing why. "Les miserables" is a wonderful masterpiece, and is certainly one of the best films I have ever watched.

I like musical films. Rather enjoy them in fact. So I went along to see Les Miserables, having not read the book or seen the stage production. I went in fresh. Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hooper. How could I go wrong?In many ways it would seem. The film was just impossible to follow. The plot was completely indecipherable. It felt like a series of music videos taped together. Moving forward at a million miles an hour without taking any time to actually tell the story. It struck me as similar to a Michael Bay film, in that the plot was secondary to the visuals (and in this film's case, the songs).Take nothing away from the principles, they're all fantastic. It's just a horrendous failure by the film makers. I shouldn't have to read the book before I go to this movie to understand what's going on. Having read about the story on Wikipedia after seeing it, it does sound absolutely fascinating. Unfortunately the film makers completely failed to capture that. Instead they've produced a series of music videos played together like on MTV. An appalling failure.

The guiding ethic of any film adaptation of a legendary source must be: "Change as little as possible." Those in charge of Les Miz knew precisely what they were working with. A few songs are shortened, a handful of lines altered, and a few scenarios condensed or adapted to their original literary form, but the whole remains gloriously and satisfyingly intact.The Work Song is set to the image of a hundred convicts battling a stormy sea to pull a listing ship into dry dock—and only here does the film's live-recording ethic fall short, as the music and voices lack the power to match the imagery, seemingly washed out by the sea noise, where the live musical would normally captivate from the first note.Neither of them theatrical belters, Jackman and Crowe's performances feel subdued in the opening scene. But the film finds its gravitas the instant Colm Wilkinson appears as the Bishop of Digne, and from that instant, the next two and a half hours are nothing less than the repeated sliding of the viewer's soul up and down a finely-honed blade.The ability to take close-ups gives the film an intimacy that is unattainable on a Broadway stage, and power numbers are sometimes reduced to a chilling whisper. Anne Hathaway destroys herself to bring Fantine to life, and her incredible, personal pain washes in waves from the screen. The tooth removal, normally excised from the musical, is even back from the book—though modified in location. Confrontation is then viscerally set as a full-on close-quarters sword fight.Film also allows a depth of scale that challenges the stage. The transition to At the End of the Day is a grim and powerful scramble through the slums of Paris, shaking the screen with the palpable rage of a nation. Look Down is another tour de force, while Do You Hear the People Sing emerges from a quiet, elegiac call to arms that organically overtakes General Lamarque's funeral procession.Samantha Barks' Éponine lights up in her every interaction with Marius, and shots of her in the background of A Heart Full of Love are soul-rending. But she suffers just enough tiny cuts that A Little Fall of Rain is not quite as arresting as it should be, and the constant close-ups amputate the power of a scene that should captivate not only through its intimacy, but through the inactivity that washes across the entirety of a once-violent stage.Russel Crowe's soft-voiced Javert takes some getting used to, and while it works more often than one might expect, he sometimes seems to be singing with a sock in his mouth—most notably during One Day More, where he seems to have been mixed in at a different volume level from the rest of the cast. Yet the cinematography of Stars is simple yet stunning, and Javert's Suicide suffers nothing in this interpretation.M. Thénardier endures a few cuts (most notably the truncation of Dog Eats Dog), but Sacha Baron Cohen steals enough asides and chews enough scenery that his part hardly feels reduced.The background has been filled in with elements from the novel, and those who have read Hugo's epic will appreciate nods to Fauchelevent and the Petit-Picpus convent, Gavroche's elephant-home, Marius' grandfather, and the tavern behind the barricade. There is even a quick cut to Gavroche when Éponine is shot, winking at their normally undisclosed sibling relationship.Even the finale remains perfectly and satisfyingly intact. The only challenge with a film that so precisely parallels its stage inspiration is resisting the necessity to deliver a standing ovation once the final note has been sung. If only they had found a way to incorporate a curtain call.

I had the pleasure of watching the film today; I entered the cinema with some degree of apprehension, as I thought it highly improbable for the film to live up to my impossibly high expectations of it as a huge fan of the musical, but any reservation I held was gone by the end of the Overture, and, for the next 150 minutes or so, I relived the first time I watched the musical at Queen's. By the end of the Finale, I was an emotional train wreck (though visibly still much more composed than many around me). I will get the two gripes I have with the movie out of the way to make room for the considerable praise I plan on showering upon it. First and foremost is Russell Crowe's singing; it has been the subject of harsh criticism, and while I agree that it might not be to everyone's tastes (it certainly does not suit mine), it certainly is not quite as bad as the critics will have you believe. His voice is quite nasal, and his range limited, but there are moments (such as the beginning of "Stars") where one could see why he was cast. Second is the music direction (and by extension some of the performances); as a purist of sorts, I was unhappy with the number of cuts they have had to make to the songs, and some of the songs have had to be modulated down to make them more comfortable for Jackman and Crowe to sing. There are also some slight changes to the orchestration, some of which I find uncomfortable. Jackman's performance of "Bring Him Home" sounds a little strained, and is a little too aggressive-sounding for my tastes, though the sheer emotion he pours into it is undeniable.Now for the good bits. The cinematography is stunning. The scenes in Greenwich, Portsmouth and the Alps are visually stunning, and the Parisian set in Pinewood with the barricade is a feast for the eyes. The CGI is unashamedly unrealistic and larger-than-life. These two factors alone could make a convincing argument for why there exists a need for film versions of musicals. Hooper's decision to fill the screen with the actors' faces in their numbers has been derided by some critics who claim that it reduces the movie to a glorified series of music videos, but I personally find that this makes for extremely immersive and intimate performances, as every twitch of the eye or the mouth is clearly visible. This works particularly well with the live singing, which makes it much more believable than any previous musical film effort. The sound recording, the costumes, the makeup: all wonderful and deserving of awards (if unconvinced, watch the "making of" featurettes on YouTube). All the performances exceeded my expectations (even Crowe's; the critics would lead you to expect something akin to Brosnan's performance in Mama Mia!). Jackman, with the exception of my personal indifference to his "Bring Me Home", is a phenomenal film-Valjean, whose highlights are definitely his soliloquy ("Who am I") and his Death Scene. Bohen and Carter are excellent as the Thénardiers, bringing much needed comic relief to the movie. Barks, of whom I am a huge fan from her stage performances as Eponine, shines, with "On My Own" being one of the highlights of the film and is quite different from how she used to do it on stage. Redmayne's "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables" is tear jerking, and he makes for an impressive Marius all-round. Allen and Huttlestone are among the best young-Cosettes and Gavroches I have ever seen. Seyfried's interpretation of the role is definitely not for everyone, but the fragile, sweet and somewhat bell-like quality of her voice captures the innocence and beauty of Cosette perfectly. The star, though, is without a doubt Hathaway, whose "I Dreamed a Dream" and death scene drew the most tears. Her acting and singing were sublime, and will influence all future performances of the character.Les Miserables is a film not to be missed, if only to watch the acting performances from Hathaway, Redmayne, Barks and Jackman. It is different enough from the stage version for the fans to have something new to which to look forward, yet loyal enough for it to be able to serve as an introduction to the stage version. And bring tissues. Lots of tissues.

To get a few things straight, I am a massive fan of this musical. It is one of my favourite musicals of all time. As I'd only previously saw a rendition of the musical at a small theater for $30, my first expectations were that the film would surpass the musical I had watched due to the worthy cast. I should've though gone into this film with low expectations as this would have made me much happier.I need to pinpoint 1 scene. Master of the House was absolutely dreadful. This has to be one of the highlights of the whole musical for me and Sasha Baren Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter ruined it - they weren't funny at all and could've done much more with the bright characters they had been given. They were obviously used for their name and not their performance skills. I commend Hugh Jackman as I grew to his character throughout the film but I felt that his voice lacked something. Anne Hathaway was good too, her voice quite magical.The only worthy performances were from Aaron Tveit and Samantha Barks who shined through their characters - this is understandable as they both have theater backgrounds. On My Own being the best scene for me.I feel as in transforming this musical to a film they could have done so much more to enhance the emotional experience.I cry from listening to the songs and the fact that a tear didn't fall tells me something. This movie lacks the emotional magic of the musical production.

Among the worst directed big budget features in recent years, Les Miserables suffers from so many problems it's hard to choose where to begin.I suppose the most annoying item is the hand-held camera shoved up the actors' noses. This unfortunate choice simultaneously throws every performance into melodramatic overdrive while also insuring the audience a nauseatingly claustrophobic roller coaster ride inches from the casts' lens-distorted features.Next up would have to be the uneven performances within the musical numbers. This is not a critique of the actors or their singing, but of the director's choice to not guide them toward performances scaled for the shots. There's a difference between belting out a musical show-tune to the back row or coming in on a close up to capture the moment which requires a quieter more internal thought. And if you're going to play those moments very wide or very close, hone the performance to suit the choice. Too often the performance is out of sync with the shot.Next, focus. In today's world of monitors, DITs and playback, there is no excuse for so much of this film to be out of focus. I don't care if your depth of field is two millimeters. Go back and get it right or pump some more light on the subject and find a depth of field and lens your AC is comfortable with.Then there are creative choices like playing Lovely Ladies strictly for the ugliness of the nineteenth century gutter it's set in and Master of the House with so little energy that not even SB Cohen can elevate it.I am not sure what film all those ten star reviews on this IMDb page are for. I can only hope that they were written by people who loved the musical and lived in hope that the film would live up to its legacy, but haven't seen it yet.As for me, I have seen it and am bitterly disappointed.

I don't enjoy musical theatre.That being said I found Les Mis to be quite engaging from a technical standpoint. Between Tom Hooper's lively camera-work and the choice to have the actor's singing live on set, the musical becomes more dynamic which is the major advantage a film adaptation has over the stage. Where I take issue with the film is that it's shot as though it were a gritty, small-scale drama, which just feels aesthetically awkward when being used for these grandiose musical sequences and large scale "emoting".Another problem I found is it feels restrained to the vision of the musical and much of what is taking place on camera isn't appropriate to the medium. By this I mean instances where instead of having a character act out what they are feeling, they instead sing it, which makes sense on the stage but is unnecessary with film where you have full view of a characters face. Also, Russell Crowe seemed to be struggling quite a bit with the high notes and the production designer went a bit overboard in the sewer escape sequence, by putting so much poo on screen at one time even I had to stop and observe "that's a bit too much poo".So as much as I liked the technical aspects I didn't really enjoy the story the film was telling and found its balance between realism and a heightened sense of reality off-putting. Although there were a bunch of 15-year-old kids crying during the emotional scenes at my screening, so maybe it was really good and I'm wrong, you decide!

I had high expectations for this movie. I can't say that I was completely blown away, but I enjoyed it. In the end I thought it could have been better so I am giving it a 9. I thought the acting was pretty good. Especially Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman. The one person I thought that could've done better was Russell Crowe. He acted well and his voice is good too. It's just when the two came together it was kind of fake. There was only one scene in the movie that I thought he pulled them both off. I really like Russell Crowe so I was pretty disappointed about that. The singing was really good. Unlike other movies, this movie's singing is recorded live and that made the performances more real. I thought all the actors had great voices and the song "Suddenly" which was written for this movie was very good. I also thought Amanda Seyfried's singing had really improved since "Mamma Mia". I really enjoyed her performances.I've heard people complaining about the horrible CG, but I honestly think it's not such a big deal. The CG was not the best, but it's the last thing that crosses your mind after you watch this wonderful movie. I enjoyed this film, even though I had expected more from it. It's one of those movie's that people will say was a turning point for musicals in the film industry. So I think it's a movie worth watching.

Tom Hooper is gonna get quite rewarded for this. Most people feel like directors and film companies keep re-hashing old ideas an stories and that original ideas are gone, but they're just few and far between. What makes this different from probably every musical before it is that Hooper changed the game by recording the acting and singing at the same time instead of recording the singing first. It's this new procedure that lets you feel every emotion the actors have and just takes musicals to a whole new level. The cast is perfect, too. Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Samantha Barks, Amanda Seyfried and the rest all do a wonderful job bringing life to a 150 year old book. (It might help to read a plot synopsis because it's a very intricate movie.) The only downside to me is that movies keep getting longer and nobody's ballsy enough to reintroduce intermissions. C'mon, Hollywood, give our bladders a break.

Wow. Tom Hooper's sensational film version of the beloved musical "Les Miserables" comes close to cinematic greatness, offering a thrilling story with few frills. Hooper relies upon his strong cast to shoulder the weight of the story instead of using cinematic pyrotechnics or CGI. He trains his camera confidently on his actors, and it is enough. "Les Miserables" is one of the best films of the year and an event of the season.Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) served nineteen years in a French prison for stealing a loaf of bread and breaks parole leading to his pursuit by the indefatigable Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe). In a new life, Valjean's carelessness leads to the destruction of the young Fantine (Anne Hathaway), a factory worker scrimping to send money to her beloved daughter Cosette. Young Cosette lives with the reprehensible Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) before a decision by Valjean changes her life. Time passes, and the plot centers upon a burgeoning insurrection in Paris involving young Marius (Eddie Redmayne) and the daughter of the Thenardiers, Eponine (Samantha Barks). With love and revolution in the air, Valjean must evade his past and protect Cosette (Amanda Seyfried).Hooper's direction focuses on the faces of the lead characters, and he delivers long, uninterrupted takes of the singing which I feel is to his credit. He does not chop or edit this film into fragments. Having only seen the musical once (this past fall in Houston), I sat in the back of the theater, enjoying the scale of the cast and songs, but I never got the sense of the faces of the actors that would come from sitting in a front row seat. And, who can afford that? Well, for the price of admission to this film, Hooper puts his stars out in front, scaling down the film from gigantic sets and props. He makes "Les Miserables" a film of faces and emotions, rendered beautifully by Jackman, Hathaway, and Barks particularly. With this film and his previous "The King's Speech," Hooper has emerged as an actor's director, putting the best in front of his camera and letting them act. That film earned Colin Firth a Best Actor Oscar and Helena Bonham Carter and Geoffrey Rush supporting acting nominations. His strengths are at play here with actors ready for the challenge."Les Miserables" examines the reclamation of one man's soul, the role of faith in a person's life. A kindness delivered upon Valjean early in the film manifests itself in two major decisions that he makes later. Without being clumsy, "Les Miserables" offers up its treatise on the importance of liberty, equality, and brotherhood unabashedly within the framing of faith. I feel that it is Hugh Jackman's best work ever as he proves himself fully capable, both strong and vulnerable, as Valjean. Anne Hathaway's brief work as Fantine is memorable, and her signature song "I Dreamed a Dream" stops the film in its tracks with its impressive holding of her face as she delivers a wounded, defiant vocal. Both Jackman and Hathaway are deserving of nominations for acting. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter delight as the Innkeeper and his wife, and "Master of the House" delivers comedic gold. Both do really brilliant work here, adding levity and humor to a dark story, as well as a flurry of comic sequences to disrupt the staid pace of the film. I do wish there were an Oscar for Best Comedic Duo; I would hand it to them."Les Miserables" feels a bit long, and I felt at times that I admired it more than loved it. From a technical standpoint, the film feels, looks, and sounds terrific. I found myself less enthusiastic about Russell Crowe's performance as Javert, but nearly everyone else delivers. A film deserving of great praise and no doubt thick crowds this holiday season, "Les Miserables" will receive a slate of Oscar nominations and probably a Best Supporting Actress statue for Anne Hathaway who this year handled two iconic roles (Catwoman and Fantine) with dexterity. "Les Miserables" is an admirable, technically brilliant film and a fantastic trip to the movies.

and this is particularly the case of "Les Mis" which has virtually no spoken dialogue, relying essentially on recitatives in the style of the grand opera where spoken dialogues are needed to drive the plot. As well, all the emotions of the characters are delivered through songs. In this context, the singing ability of the cast, although perhaps not one hundred per cent essential, does count a lot. Hugh Jackman fares best. With a Tony musical award (2004 "The boy from Oz") in his resume, he has claim to best credentials in the lot. Those who don't go to live plays will still remember his riveting performance of the introductory medley in hosting the 2009 Oscar. As Jean Valjean, Jackman's singing ability richly augments his acting. The one number I was waiting for right from the beginning of the movie is "Bring him home". The emotional intensity is a challenge, as are the high note. Jackman in wonderful in delivering the beautiful song and the emotion behind it, which is essential to the plot later when he entrusted Cosette completely to Marius's care.Russell Crowe, on the other hand, is by comparison the least endowed in the department of singing, his proved acting ability notwithstanding. The part of Javert helps though, requiring no command in the higher vocal range. He does sound a bit strained at the early recitative, but handles adequately Javert's solo number "Stars" in its baritone range with only an occasional highest note in E. His acting ability more than makes up for whatever relative shortcoming there is in singing.The biggest name in the female cast is obviously Anne Hathaway, whose appearance as Fantine is actually quite brief, as anyone who is familiar with the musical would know. And yet, her number "I dreamed a dream" has in the last couple of years acquired a benchmark through a once unknown name Susan Boyle. But then, Boyle's performance has taken the song entirely out of the context of the story, and therefore does not offer meaningful comparison. Hathaway has her own credentials from Broadway and delivers her solo number with profession proficiency in the singing department. In acting, it may even be good enough for a Golden Globe supporting award for which she has been nominated.Amanda Seyfried is perhaps the next best known, from her role as Sophie in "Mama Mia" which she secured undoubtedly in part due to her own music academy training as a soprano. Portraying sweet and innocent Cosette is no challenge to her (you'll know what I mean if you've seen her in 2009's "Chloe" in the titular role). Perhaps a little surprisingly, the role teenage Cosette does not have much singing, not even her own solo number (even child Cosette has "Castle on a cloud"). So again, no challenge for Seyfriend as she comes across captivating and lovely in the romantic duet "A heart full of love" with Marius. For this musical, the two key male roles are labelled as "lead" while the three key female roles are all called "secondary lead". I have referred to two of them, but it's the third, Eponine, that comes closest to being THE female lead. While different in nature, Eponine's emotional demand is just as strong as Fantine's, and she has more singing than either Fantine or Cosette. As to a hit solo, Susan Boyle notwithstanding, Eponine's "On my own" plays no second fiddle to "I dreamed a dream". Personally I like it even better. Samantha Barks, hitherto little known, is absolutely wonderful.Eddie Redmayne, who is generally known for his non-singing sort-of male lead in "My week with Marilyn", does not come with any exceptional musical credentials. But then he displays a beautiful lyric tenor voice right from his first appearance as Marius, and handles all the singing throughout very comfortably.For the comic relief couple of dubious character, sing ability is not at the top of the list of priority and so, who can argue with casting Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. Besides, it's not as if they can't sing – just watch (or listen to, rather) them in "Sweeney Todd: The demon barber of Fleet Street". To sum up, the movie should be able to satisfy those who have enjoyed the musical on stage.

NEVER MIX Hollywood ACTORS WITH THEATRICAL STAGE PERFORMERS...IT WILL ONLY SHOW HOW BAD YOU ARE IN ACTING AND SINGING (Anne Hathaway your an exception and Meryl Streep, Mamma Mia) "Les Miserables" would have been a fantastic film. One of the best I've seen in awhile BUT when you put A-list celebrities to sing, and I know the reason why, for box office draw, then you just killed a masterpiece. Hugh Jackman and Amanda Seyfried are passable and I can live with but of course I would rather have Simon Bowman play Jean Valjean and Emily Bull or someone else play Cossette but Russell Crowe? Tom Hooper were you drunk when you chose Russell Crowe? The guy can't sing every time he sings I want to go to the bathroom or do some meditating and wish I was in another planet! Everyone else was fantastic, Samantha Barks as Eponine was awesome (of course she played Eponine in the London production). Anne Hathaway is mesmerizing as Fantine now I know why Hugh Jackman lobbied for her. Her performance as Fantine deserves an Oscar nomination and I hope she wins. Eddie Redmayne as Marius is amazing and the list goes on. Overall an amazing film! I would definitely watch it again and when the DVD or Blu- Ray comes out I will definitely get a copy and "WHEN RUSSELL CROWE COMES OUT TO SING THEN ITS TIME FOR ME TO GO THE BATHROOM or MEDITATE AND BE IN ANOTHER PLANET" Please just be the Gladiator and make sequels part 2, part 3, part 4 I don't care just stay away from musicals and by the way I don't even own a copy of any of your movies hah! Here is my Christmas wish... Director Tom Hooper when you release the DVD or Blu-ray I'm sure it will be a Special Edition release can you please take out Russell Crowe and use someone else to play Javert, I sugggest Hans-Peter Janssens (from the London production)and THAT WOULD TRULY BE A SPECIAL EDITION COPY :)

As a huge fan of the musical, I have been waiting with anticipation for this movie release. I just got back from the Christmas eve 10pm showing of this movie, and I must say that I am somewhat disappointed. There were some positives, but I feel it could have been so much better.First the positives. There are some very strong performances here.Anne Hathaway's performance has already drawn critical acclaim, so I won't dwell on it, except to say that the acclaim is well deserved.Hugh Jackman's voice tone and interpretation of Jean Valjean is quite different from anyone before, and I found myself drawn deeply to this Jean Valjean, sympathizing with his every emotion. I thought he did a great job of switching between a rough gravelly tone to a more clean ringing falsetto depending on the emotions of the character. I do have a complaint about directorial cues on one of Jean Valjean's key numbers, but more on that below.Eddie Redmayne as Marius gives a great performance. For the stage productions, Marius has always been one of my least favorite characters, always lacking depth with what I perceived as just immature blind infatuation for Cosette as his only emotion. In this movie, Eddie really captured each moment: his love for Cosette in the moonlight garden scene, his determination and drive for revolution, his remorse and anguish during "Empty chairs at empty tables" (a real tour-de-force performance). I thought he was wonderful.Also, the set/locations/scenery/costumes/make up really allow the audience to immerse into the story. I think this point is one of the greatest benefits a movie setting has over a stage production, and this movie delivers on this front. From the beautiful country settings, to the grime and grit of poverty in Montreuil and Paris, there is a strong sense of realism that you can't get in stage production (they did overdo it slightly in the sewer scene).Now on to the negatives.I have seen a few reviews complaining about the slow pace of the film. I thought the opposite. It felt kinda rushed. I know the stage production is 3 hours long, but I wish they hadn't sacrificed the story and proper delivery to save on run time for the movie. Some of the scene transitions are rather abrupt and leaves a sense of this being an ensemble of songs, rather than one flowing story. I'm not a purist in that I will complaint about every single change from the stage production, but some of the cuts and omissions really hurt the flow of the story and leaves some key characters and relationships woefully under-developed. Having said that, I do think one addition was brilliant: the scene with Jean Valjean singing to a sleeping Cosette in the carriage as they leave the Thenardier's inn. It really gives a great insight into the change that Jean Valjean goes through and the bond that he forms with Cosette.Enjolras seems shuffled as a minor character, which is too bad as Aaron Tveit played the part with great passion when given the chance. Even though fleeting, Enjolras, Grantaire, and even Gavroche share some moments in the stage production that allows us to bond with these characters. I felt the movie marginalized each as their own without developing a bond between them.Eponine also seemed to be under-developed. I can't quite place it. The individual performances were very strong, but "On my own" and "A little fall of rain" didn't quite have the same emotional impact that I thought it would. I think it was due to the lack of insight into the dynamic between Marius and Eponine. There was a lot of Eponine watching Marius fall in love with Cosette from a distance, but only one instance that I can remember of Marius unknowingly hurting Eponine during their interaction. I can think of 3 or 4 such occurrences in the stage production and really sympathizing with Eponine each time it happened. Again, subtle differences, but it really detracted from the overall story for me.Also, I didn't care for Hugh Jackman's rendition of, and Tom Hooper's direction of "Bring him home". In the stage production, this song is very subdued with Jean Valjean singing in beautiful high falsetto while watching over a sleeping Marius. There is a beauty to its simpleness, and it is almost like a glimpse into Valjean's mind as he silently sends a prayer up to God. This movie's interpretations is much more... dynamic. Hugh Jackman delivers with a stronger force as Valjean nervously walks around the 2nd story of a building looking down on a sleeping Marius at the barricade. Certainly a very different interpretation, and it didn't work for me.One last bit of negative was the casting of Russell Crowe as Javert. I am a fan of Russell Crowe, and while he is a great fit for the look and persona of Javert, I just did not feel he fit the vocal demands of the character. It prevented me from empathizing with Javert, my favorite character from the stage production.With as much anticipation as I had going in, I'm afraid it was a bit of a disappointment. I really wanted to like this, but came away thinking of what could have been. Certainly a must see for all fans of the musical, but it is a shame that this movie will be the sole judgement of Les Mis for millions of viewers who may never have a chance to see the stage production.

"Les Miserables" is a great musical.Don't waste anymore time. Give every Best Supporting Actress Award this year to Anne Hathaway. It's not light and fluffy like Mary Poppins; it deals with an extremely dark and difficult time in human history. It's a bit long and uneven at times.If all singing is not your thing you may have trouble with this. Hugh Jackman can act and sing. Russel Crowe gives it a good shot. So what if Crowe sings in front of a bird statue, it's not a crow. Songs are spread out to the supporting cast and they all deliver.It's an extremely powerful movie that evokes emotion. If you don't want to cry don't go. If you go and don't cry you have no heart. If you want to be amazed by the power of a movie spend two and a half hours with this outstanding cinematic achievement.

As someone who has been burned by every single Hollywood adaptation of Les Miserables, let me categorically state that this time it was done right! Everything from the acting to the music to the sets was borderline perfect. The only thing that could possibly be considered a negative was something that was absolutely unavoidable. That is, when you are taking a novel as voluminous as Les Miserables and condensing it into a feature length movie, some things will be cut or rushed. This is no exception. The movie moves at breakneck speed. Anyone who is fond of the Broadway musical will no doubt not be bothered by it, but people new to the story or those who have only read the novel might be put off by it.As far as the acting and music is concerned, I can find very little to fault. Russel Crowe was the weakest of the lot as I just didn't find his voice to be up to the task of singing some of Javert's songs (Stars immediately springs to mind). Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Samantha Barks were all especially good. The intense emotions their characters experience throughout the story are perfectly performed.This naturally leads to a critique of the music. Anyone familiar with the Broadway show will undoubtedly find themselves joyously mouthing along to the familiar lyrics and might be surprised at a couple of brand new songs written specifically for the movie. Just as in the show, the music is brilliant and meshes wonderfully with the story.One of the biggest treats, however, were the sets and special effects. The beauty and squalor of 19th century Paris was showcased magnificently and it really allowed you to become engrossed in story.This is a movie that both fans of the novel as well as fans of the musical can both fall in love with, since even though there are some deviations from the novel this is still the closest a film version has ever come to being completely faithful to the book. Additionally, this movie is a perfect chance for those who have never read the book or haven't heard of or had a chance to see the Broadway show. I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone. My only warning is to limit your fluid intake, since at 2.5+ hours your chance of encountering an overflowing bladder is a very real danger.

After years of waiting, Les Mis the movie is here. Excellent tribute to the musical. I have seen musical twice. I am not going to explain the plot, just commenting on the technicals.Great Points: Movie is long, seems to have all songs and some I don't remember from the musical and the cast soundtrack. The twists and turns of the plot were easier to follow than the musical. ( I have ADD) Hugh Jackman is perfect for Jean ValJean. It looks like he starved himself to shoot the opening scenes, then gained weight for the rest of the movie. Voice is great. Film showed the gritty of France's poor during this historical era. I guess they did not have to spend a lot of the budget on makeup or soap or hair dressers. Scenery was great as well, gritty and clean when it needed to be. Cinematography was lots of head shot of the singers with blurry background. kind of like an antique camera. Since it is a musical, it worked. Sacha and Helen Bonham were very good as the innkeeper and wife, but I was expecting a little more comedy relief. Also, Sacha started with French accent at beginning but ended up with a Cockney accent at the end of the film. I liked Anne Hathaway's solo, lots of emotion and very good voice. I know she has received a lot of bad press on her performance.Not so good points: I love Russell and he is a respected character in many movies, but I could not accept him singing. I kept seeing him as Gladiator or Capt. Aubrey. He did ride a horse like a pro.Movie is long, so see with empty bladder.Hope you enjoy it as well as I did.

Les Miserables, the movie opera, is a perfect tribute to the emotional magnetism of Victor Hugo's historic novel of early 19th century French Revolution, portraying the valor of one good man in the face of societal and historic turmoil. Indeed, the movie version is a hit, because the compellingly plot, one that transcends centuries, was kept in tact, consistent with the powerful mega hit opera that preceded the movie. Performances by Hugh Jackman as the valiant John Valjean, and Russell Crow as the powerfully righteous Javert, are realistic to their roles as mirror opposites and equal protagonist characters. I've seen "Les Mis", the stage opera, five times, including once in London, where it's justifiably a theater staple of London's West End. Therefore, I was skeptical about cinema weaknesses, but the movie exceeds expectations. It's magnificent. Ann Hathaway gives the breakout performance of her career as Fantine. Hathaway sheds her previous movie characters, as she bares her soul to the plot, playing the abused mother of the beautifully sympathetic child named Cosette (played as an adult by Amanda Seyfried). Cosette becomes a stunningly beautiful lady because Valjean intervenes into her dismal situation as a child orphan who was poorly cared for by the two crooked but comically played Thenardiere's (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter), an inn keeper couple who treat Cosette as child labor. "Les Miserables" is one of the greatest novels of modern history and the opera-play, now the stunning movie, are challenged to maintain the emotional integrity of Hugo's drama, as well as the strength of the iconic Valjean and Javert. Thankfully, the integrity of Hugo's story put to cinema is maintained. Although the music is beautiful, the singing voices of Jackman, Hathaway and Crowe do not equal those in the stage opera. On the other hand, Seyfried is perfectly cast in her role as Cosette. Eponine, the character played and sung by Samantha Barks, isn't as strong in the movie plot as her character appears in the stage version; nevertheless, she provides a powerful performance. Child actors Isabelle Allen, Natalya Wallace and, especially, Daniel Huttlestone give good performances, with Hugglestone excelling in his role. This movie will be loved by fans of the novel and the "Les Mis" stage opera. Those exposed to the story for the first time, or who are unfamiliar with Victor Hugo, may want to brush up on their literary history before enjoying this memorable movie. Victor Hugo could not have foreseen how his novel would extend the powerful moral intention of this historic saga well into the 21st Century.

This was beautiful. First movie that really made me cry. I have to applaud the entire cast (yes, even Russel Crowe) for being so amazing. But I must say, the performance that really gave me chills was Redmayne's 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables'. I've been a long time fan of the musical, and I've been listening to Michael Ball's version my entire life and that was the first time I really, really felt the grief and pain in that scene. Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman most definitely deserve the praise they have been given, as well as Samantha Barks as a tear jerking Eponine. Amanda Seyfried brought some depths to Cosette that I'd never seen before. Russel Crowe's Javert may not have been stellar, but I believed him. I have seen a lot of reviews putting the directing down, with the extreme zooms on singers. I must say that I was worried about this, but to me it just gives a beautiful view of everything the character is feeling. A+. I can't wait to see it again.

I read a lot of reviews so I expected Les Miserables to fall short of expectations, but I really enjoyed the film version. Better yet, it captured my imagination where I wanted to read more on the making of it, casting choices, etc. A lot of critics are harping on the close ups, but why else would one adapt a theatrical production into a movie unless you wanted to utilize the advantages of cinema? No, it doesn't dwell on sweeping vistas, but vistas are there as throwaways. Probably because they're CGI and look fake anyway, Mr. Hooper chose not to dwell on them. What I appreciated was the intimacy of the songs and the emotional honesty in their delivery.Another critique I read was the film revels in ugliness. Um. You mean like the novel? It's increasingly irritating to read film criticism from people who have neither interest or experience with the subject matter. As a filmed musical version of Les Miserables, it's amazingly good. I slogged through the book back in the day, right after I bought the London Cast Soundtrack of the play and grim, harsh reality is what Victor Hugo was going for. (That, and endless explorations on what it is to rebel.) To the film's credit, Fantine doesn't get her two front teeth pulled out. That would've been hard to take, watching her sing "I Dreamed a Dream" with gaps in her grill.Overall, I agreed with Director Tom Hooper's choices. I always thought a film version of "I Dreamed A Dream" would have flashbacks of a sunny country side and any other images about idyllic love, instead Mr. Hooper stays close on Anne Hathaway's beautiful, heartfelt rendition of the song and it nearly moved me to tears. I read a number of reviews criticizing Russell Crowe's singing and while he may not be Pavarotti, he did what any actor has to do if they don't have the voice of an angel: He sells the songs. Of all the Javerts I've seen captured on film, (Anthony Perkins, Geoffrey Rush, Mr. Crowe) I believed his the most. (Geoffrey Rush seemed like he should just take Valjean out for a beer.) Javert is a strange character. You have to believe that he's so obsessed with Justice and the law that he'll take his own life when his meaning of it unravels. Russell Crowe does all the work in his eyes not in his voice. I thought he was amazingly good. And I appreciated Tom Hooper's choice of having Javert flirting with death while he sings Stars, foreshadowing the way he will meet his demise.Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman did solid work as Jean Valjean, but he unfortunately, fell short on "Bring Him Home," which of course is Valjean's and (possibly the play's) showstopper, he got a little pitchy and cracky and didn't bring the tears. For that reason I give the film 8 instead of 10 stars.But aside from that, it's a stirring, rousing, clap-at-the-end-of nearly-every scene Film musical.

Yes, I love the musical, yes I was singing along to the entire movie in my head and yes it is different from the west end/Broadway show but that by no means takes away from the brilliance of this movie. I don't understand all these negative reviews about it not being the same as the theatre version, obviously its not the same, this is a movie not a theatre production. Complaints about the singing? What is there to complain about!? Every actor made you believe the heartbreak, poverty, grief, jealousy that they were feeling. I was drawn in to every note that came out of their mouths whether it was bellowed out or whispered. Hugh Jackman is phenomenal, if he does not win an Oscar I will be gutted for him. His acting exceeds him in his portrayal of Jean Valjean. His final scene with Anne Hathaway blew me away and I could not stop sobbing. Every moment was believable. I loved how he changed his voice according to his character's aging. Jackman is amazing in all his films but Les Miserables is his best to date easily. There has been a lot of hype about Anne Hathaway's Fantine and she did not disappoint. Her 'I dreamed a dream' had the whole audience sobbing, including myself. Apart from the obvious candidates of Jackman and Hathaway I thought the true stars who have been under-rated and were spectacular are Eddie Redmayne as Marius and Aaron Tveit as Enjolras. Ramin Karimloo's Enjolras in the 25th anniversary for me was unbeatable but Tveit's performance topped it. Black and Red was just wow, Redmayne and Tveit made a wonderful duo and I was weeping at Enjolra's death which brings me onto Redmayne's performance. I thought he nailed this role, he was the Marius that I had in my head and I can't even begin to explain how i felt when he sang 'Empty Chairs and Empty Tables' the tears just weren't stopping, he was amazing! His interaction with Samantha Barks was brilliant and he was just the perfect gentleman during her death scene. I think a lot of us girls have been Eponine at some point in our lives and Barks portrayed that heartbreak wonderfully. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen were brilliant as the Thenardiers and all the horrible comments about Russel Crowe are unjustifiable. He was a great Javert. Yes his voice may not match that of those who have played the part before him but he made up for it in his acting. 'Stars' was beautiful and his suicide was heartbreaking. I can honestly not critisise a single thing about this movie. Cast, editing, singing, make-up, costumes just everything was brilliant. The movie has had a lot of hype but as a theatre and film lover I can honestly say you will not be disappointed. As long as you don't make the mistake of comparing it to the west end/Broadway productions too much you will fall in love with this movie as much as I did! ENJOY!

Les Miserables is very old fashioned entertainment. It's a series of crescendo moments with no build-up, no backstory, no pause. It's like eating just the topping of the pecan pie, and not bothering with the crust or filling. We were just ten minutes into the movie when I had to look at my watch and ask, okay, how long can they keep this up? Climax after climax, plot twist after plot twist, tearjerking scene after tearjerking scene. Oceans! Mountains! Punishment! Suffering! Religion! Redemption! Will there be a break for lunch? Will we be able to catch our breath? If you can watch this film without crying, I don't want to know you. The woman behind me was on the edge of her seat, not just because I smell good. The audience at the 10:40 a.m. matinée – the theater was packed – applauded at the end, and was very slow to leave the theater, even as the closing credits rolled. Typical of big, fat, nineteenth-century novels, there are numerous implausible coincidences that drive the plot. These coincidences took me out of the movie, but that was a good thing. The human suffering on screen was overwhelming: suicide, enslavement, exploitation of living humans' body parts, prostitution, disease, spite, malice, child abuse, starvation, sadism, a dying man escaping through very graphic sewerage. I did have to repeat to myself, "This is only a movie" even as tears streamed down my cheeks. Jean Valjean is imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving children. He slaves for twenty years. He hauls a massive, capsized sailing ship. The scene does look like obviously fake CGI, but that doesn't make it any less gut wrenching. The workers sing, "You'll always be a slave. You are standing in your grave." They are the men we see in Sebastiao Salgado photographs of Third World laborers. They are Ilya Repin's "Barge Haulers on the Volga." Valjean's nemesis is the crazily obsessive policeman, Javert. They spar throughout the film, as Valjean's fate rises and falls and rises and falls and rises  you get the idea. A story this big, this broad, and this implausible requires one hundred percent commitment from the performers. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is superb. He believes. He emotes. He is as big as the story itself. Jackman is the heart and soul of "Les Miserables." I loved him. Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen – they all had me convinced. Russell Crowe was a surprising disappointment. He's a brilliant actor and I kept waiting for him to bring some fire, some ice, some power, some insight to Javert, the obsessive and punitive policeman who mercilessly hounds Jean Valjean. I wanted a memorable moment that would make me feel that Crowe's performance brought Javert to intimate life for me. That moment did not arrive. I wondered while watching this movie whether it will be embraced by the political left or the political right. It is a deeply and unashamedly Christian film. A Catholic priest, emulating Jesus, is the catalyst. Valjean spends the rest of the film working to live up to the priest's Biblical example. "Les Miserable" is leftist in that it depicts the poor rising up, but then the poor fail their own putative saviors, and allow them to be massacred, alone. Javert, representing law and order, is a monster. The film's brief glimpse of heaven is like some limousine liberal's fantasy. I think "Les Miserables" is as popular as it is for the same reason that Cinderella is so popular. When "Les Miserable" was a stage play, tickets were a very expensive and difficult to acquire luxury. It is ironic that a play about the wretched of the earth would be such a luxury entertainment. Why do we enjoy watching people much poorer and more desperate than we will ever be? Why do we pay for the privilege? Because we all see ourselves in Cinderella, in Jean Valjean, no matter how lucky we are. I'll certainly never stand in cold sea water with iron shackles around my wrists and neck, overseen by a cold sadist like Javert. But, along with millions of others, I saw my own struggles in Valjean, and thanked God that I didn't have it as bad as he. If Jean Valjean can go on, I can, too! I wish the songs had been a tad better. There are a couple of good ones, "I dreamed a dream" and "Do you hear the people sing?" All the actors sing very well. Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman sing especially well.

Where to start? This movie was just bad. I should probably say that I've seen the stage show of Les Mis 9 times. I went into the movies expecting to be underwhelmed, but I never thought I would walk out of the theater disappointed enough to sit down and write this review for it. Almost everything about this movie was wrong. The two people who could actually sing (Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit) were only given small opportunities to show their talent. The rest of the cast was either underwhelming (Helena Bohnam Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen) or bad (Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe). The classic musical numbers that make Les Mis spectacular were completely unrecognizable. Hathaway's "I Dreamed a Dream" reminded me of when Dory decided to speak whale in Finding Nemo. "Master of the House" and "Beggar at the Feast," two comical numbers were scaled down so much that I wonder why they even bothered putting the two in the movie. "Stars," my all time favorite Les Mis song was butchered by Russell Crowe, who sounds worse than Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia! Jackman's "Bring Him Home" was the cherry on top of a collection of poorly executed songs. A lot of people are complaining about the "Blair Witch" camera work, and I have to agree. It's distracting and takes away from the movie. Also, it provides the audience with a close up view of the saliva in the actors' mouths. Gross. I will admit, I am very biased, but I think that everyone involved in the movie should have realized that a lot of the audience members have grown up with the 10th Anniversary cast recording or have actually seen the show. If you're seeing this because you've seen the musical, think twice. It is nothing like the stage production. If you're seeing this because you read the book, think twice. It is similar to the book, but not enough to pass as an adaptation of it. If you've seen it and read it, go see Django Unchained instead. I've heard it's pretty good. I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't.

I will admit, I have waited a year for the movie adaption of "Les Miserables". Let me tell you it certainly was worth the long wait. I went to see it with my mother today as a Christmas gift to her from me. We settled in and allowed the big screen to take us away. The story is about Jean Valjean, a convict who is freed after 20 years in prison and is chased by the policeman Inspector Javert. Throughout the chase, Valjean touches the lives of so many people especially Cosette-whom he later adopts from her late mother Fantine. I won't go into major details. Just know that the music was incredible, the actors had all sung live. There was no pre-recording. This made it real, and raw which the audience will immediately see. You will fall in love with the characters and, yes, cry. But you're among friends as the whole theater may cry so you won't be alone. The movies exceeded my expectations and if the actors, especially Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman do not win Oscars for their performance, there is something wrong with the world. See this movie, you won't regret it. Be sure to grab a box of tissues before you enter, you'll need them.

This really was one of the best movie musicals in the past decade like Richard Roeper said.I don't know what people were saying but the camera work didn't bother me.I have been a fan of the musical since I was about 10 or 11.This has to be one of the most emotional movies I have seen all year or better yet of all time.Anne Hathaway-Where do I start?This is hands down one of the best performances I have seen in forever.Her rendition of I dreamed a dream will make you reach for tissues and forget all the others who came before her.She has my vote for Best Supporting Actress.I did lose it a few times but not as many as I thought I would.I lost it during come to me,I dreamed a dream.And for some reason during the 1st Do you Hear the People sing?My observation and based on what I was thinking.I think I lost it due to the fact I was thinking "Oh my God they actually pulled it off."Russell Crowe-Yes in general the weak link but in my opinion forget critics and forget the haters He pulled it off.Not as Bad as I thought.Eddie Redmayne-The Best Marius I have ever seen and his version of ECAET will make you say..."Michael Ball who?".Hugh Jackman-My only complaint would be he strained his voice a little during the first part of BHH but then grew into it.This is a film where I would say if you love the show and are not a little anal when it comes to changes then this is truly the film for you.I don't give it the full 10 because of the fact no film can ever be 100% perfect but this one came pretty close.This has my vote for Best Picture but I would still have to check out Django Unchained and Zero Dark Thirty, But I seriously doubt either can top this.Be warned:If you hate musicals STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!!!!!!!!!!It is literally singing from top to bottom with only some dialogue spread out.My Nominations and Wins. Best Picture Best Director Best Actor-Hugh Jackman Best Supporting Actress-Anne Hathaway,Samantha Barks Best Supporting Actor-EDDIE REDMAYNE Best Cinematography Best Sound Mixing/Sound Editing Best Original Song Best Editing Best Adapted Score if they still give out those. This is a film that demands to be seen on the big screen don't wait for DVD/Blu-ray.

I saw Les Miserables on Broadway many years ago - it was a stunning musical. Saw this movie tonight and was very impressed. Clearly, a compromise was made between singing and acting and, for the most part, I was happy with it. The cinematography and visual effects are great. The sets and costumes are great. The acting is great. The directing is very good - I do think some minor mistakes were made (would love to be able to ask the director about some of them). The vocals ranged from very good to disappointing.I believe Russell Crowe as Javert was a mistake. While visually he is an appealing Javert, the vocals were too weak to justify this casting decision. Javert's final number was a great disappointment for me - a powerful song that Crowe could not deliver.Other vocal pieces were also muted, but they were justified by magnificent acting performances that could not be achieved without compromising the vocals. These are interpretations I can live with, although I think many of the vocals from Marius were too high in tone (I think I would have cast him differently).I thought the performances by Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and Samantha Barks were outstanding. Strangely, I also particularly liked Colm Wilkerson as the Bishop.All things considered, this an excellent production, and I highly recommend it.

It's too bad not all of the leads are great singers. And somebody should buy the director a tripod; the hand-held ultra closeups become dizzying and pretentious after awhile. (So many times, this movie cries out for an occasional wide shot. You know the famous wagon-pinning-the-citizen scene? We never even get to see the wagon. We start right with the closeup of the victim!)But there's also a lot right with this version: inspired casting, rich visuals, and of course a brilliant score. Fascinating how certain themes and moments give "Les Mis" a different meaning when you have closeups (in this case, almost nothing BUT closeups) at your disposal. Really glad we went. Would be gladder if the camera-work hadn't drawn so much attention to itself.

Ugh-I really wanted to like this but it was sort of painful. I didn't go expecting it to be like the Broadway rendition or other adaptations. There should have been dialogue interspersed with singing by someone who could DEVELOP the characters. Then perhaps the viewer could care about them more: e.g. Anne Hathaway was an insanely great vocalist, but I couldn't give 2 poops about "Fantine". Hugh Jackman was good, but "Jean" was a pill. Both Russell Crowe's nasalized voice and his flat, flat, flat Javert was so depressing. The Thenardiers saved me from wanting to dive into the Seine too. The 5 stars are split between Hathaway's short and underdeveloped appearance and the cinematography.

Having never seen the stage version of Les Miserables and having read limited reviews of the film, I honestly didn't know what to expect from Tom Hooper's Les Miserables. After experiencing the film earlier today, I can say it was a tremendous experience.I felt the first thirty minutes or so were the strongest of the entire film, plunging us into the despair and conflicts of various characters with adroit narrative thrust so that not a moment feels wasted or redundant. Two of the three (in my opinion) gut-wrenching musical numbers come in this section- Anne Hathaway's "I Dreamed a Dream" (which, if I recall correctly, was filmed largely in a single take) and Hugh Jackman's "Who Am I?". I can only speculate but, compared to the stage version, being able to take in every facial nuance in the film version seems to make the moments of crescendo and soaring strings pack so much more of an emotional punch. Both Hathaway and Jackman also deliver top-notch performances, and it's hard to imagine anyone else fitting the role of Valjean as well as Jackman. Thematically, the film also shines in this section. Here we are introduced to the major theme of forgiveness for the first time, through Fantine we tap into maternal bonds as well as disillusionment, and Valjean's struggles explore the conflict between not only public and private selves but also reconciling our own personal interests with what is morally correct.It seemed curious to me that the bleakest moments of the film (at least for me) came at the beginning, which made it impossible for the film to regain that same sense of gravitas as the story progressed. While the remainder of the film was certainly entertaining, it felt both less emotionally involving and less taut than the beginning.Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen provided some much appreciated comic relief, but their antics seemed oddly out of place in this film at times, and often left me feeling as though I were watching Sweeney Todd again. Russell Crowe, while certainly no vocal powerhouse, did a fine job as Javert, although I found his final number to be oddly anti-climactic. The younger actors gave fine performances as well, with Samantha Barks demonstrating the most potential and Eddie Redmayne surprisingly delivering the final gut-wrenching number, "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables." The thematic exploration of the rise and fall of idealism makes this sequence especially poignant.Artistically, Les Miserables is a feast. The production design is top-notch, with meticulously crafted sets and props. Makeup and costumes are definitely noteworthy as well. Many of the shots of Paris have an artificially beautiful aesthetic to them, and every crane shot adds a sense of beauty and scope to the piece. Editorially, the film makes takes advantage of cuts to characters in different locations or concurrent events which would not have been possible in the stage version of Les Mis.One minor complaint from a filmmaking perspective was cinematographer Danny Cohen's method of framing characters. Conventional cinematography typically frames actors so that their faces are demarcating either the left or right third of the screen, with the camera positioned so that their subjects are turned towards the remaining two thirds of the screen. In Les Miserables (though thankfully not to the same extent as in The King's Speech), a few times the characters are positioned so that they are facing the other direction- the edge of the screen. Though I imagine the filmmakers were attempting to add visual flourish to the film, I found this technique oddly jarring, drawing me out of the film and making me conscious I was watching a movie.The film does regain some levity in its rousing finale, which ties the film together in plot, theme, and song. Despite the minor issues I had with the film, I found it to be a hard-hitting and rousing work of art. I could probably sum it up best by noting that this is the first movie I've been to where even old men were wiping their teary eyes by the time the credits rolled.

I went into this movie quite determined to love it, if not like it as well. It's one of my favorite musicals, and the cast includes some of my favorite actors, so my bias is there. Well, i love it, and like it quite a bit too. It is a wonderful big-screen realization of a wonderful stage production. The cast does outstanding work, and the orchestration is superb as well. This film deserves Oscar nominations for acting, scoring, art direction/set decoration and costume design. I thought the editing could have been somewhat tighter. And i was put off by the new song that was included in the middle of the movie, which slowed down the plot development unnecessarily. In fact, i wished instead of the new song, the more enjoyable Little People number could have been used in full. Stand-out song performances included Anne Hathaway (I Dreamed a Dream), Russell Crowe (Stars), Hugh Jackman (Who Am I?), Eddie Redmayne (Empty Chairs and Empty Tables) and Daniel Huttlestone (Look Down). Those who are not familiar with the story may wish to check out the non-musical Les Miserables with Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush first, before catching this musical version.

Like any good fan, I have been waiting with eager anticipation for this movie and Tom Hooper has delivered.It will be very hard to write a fair review considering I have seen the Broadway musical live as well as the DVD's of the 10th and 25th anniversary of it, but I will try.The sets/costumes...Very good, had the time period nailed perfect, watching the prisoners try to bring in a ship was kind of awe struck. To be honest the Barricade was a little weak, but they were working within their means of the period. However I was confused, because the ending had the Barricade that was envisioned.But let's talk about what really matters...the singing.Val Jean: I really wasn't worried with Hugh Jackman being cast, but I was concerned when I saw "making of" clips and he was talking about how he can control the tempo but considering he is an accomplished Broadway actor, he nailed it perfect.Javert: Russel Crowe also did a good job. He had the physical presence of the role nailed however there were some spots where his voice was off.Fantine: Ann Hatheway did an excellent job. I really did love her take on "I dream a dream". Instead of making it a romantic version that usually portrayed on the stage, she made it more emotional and made you feel the pain Fantine was experiencing.Thenardiers: Sacha Baron Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter both did a good job and actually fit the roles perfect. Watching "Master of the House" was a fun scene.The rest of the cast hit their spots as well.My one issue that I had, was they wrote a new song just for the movie. They also deleted a song as well. I guess that is the purest talking in me.I should also mention..It was awesome to see Colm Wilkinson in the movie. He was the original Val Jean from Broadway and it was something special to see him on the screen.I am definitely going to see this movie again.

Remember the lousy version of "Phantom of the Opera" a few years ago? Les Miz is nothing like that. It is an amazing adaptation to video and one of the best movies I have seen in years.Go see it. Bring enough tissues too, because you are going to need it.Why should you see it? First of all the story still rings a powerful message even after all these year since it was written. I saw the Broadway play several years ago and it was wonderful. I saw a local High School version of it and liked it even better, but this film version tops them all. A story of judgement, or redemption, of love, of treating people the way we should be treated to bring out the best in all of us. A powerful message we all can relate to. Next: the performances are astounding. I don't understand why they are criticizing some of the performances because for the first time ever, all the songs are recorded just as you see them. They are not lip-syncing anything and this presents a real treat, a raw and emotion laden touch to it all. Then there is the astounding photography to it all that is not all green-screened (although some it). Its one thing to read a book where the pictures are created in your mind and another one to watch someone else's creation of that same information. Because there have been so many versions of this over the years (including other movies) the use of the latest in technology really adds some amazing things to it all. Lastly, the music and the score. It is wonderfully done and never gets old. Go see this movie. It doesn't have a single comic book super hero or alien transformer in site! It has a powerful story that will change the way you see life.

this is the best film I have seen in a few years, if you love the book or plays you will love this movie. I will not ruin it for anyone who reads this review and wishes to see the film, but I have plans to watch it 3 more times in the future in less then a week. damn, I want to watch it now, I was crying through the whole thing. :_) this movie has an A1 cast I am not a Russell Crowe fan at all,but in my opinion everyone who was in this film deserves an academy award, I really hope they at least gets nominated, for if not that would be the greatest injustice, since the first Futurama cancellation. my aunt has never watched the play or read the book and she was just blown away by this epic movie.

Just to warn people, there are two big criticisms you really shouldn't let bother you: 1.) It's not Broadway, because it's a movie. No matter what, it was never going to be the same thing as a good stage production of Les Miserables anyway. 2.) No movie should be expected to be completely faithful to a book. If somebody paints a painting about something, and later, somebody writes a song about the exact same thing, people don't expect the lyrics of the song to perfectly explain the painting, but this movie is fair and true enough to the original Victor Hugo novel and story. In the case of the original Les Miserables, Victor Hugo's novel from the 1800s is 1,900 pages long and it wasn't a musical anyway. You couldn't fit all of a book that size into 5 movies, but this movie is true enough to the original story. Plus it fits in almost all of the original Broadway production music.That being said, I'm not really a big fan of musicals, in fact I tend to not like them, Oklahoma-boring, South Pacific-who cares. About the only musicals I ever really liked include Pink Floyd The Wall and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.But this movie is excellent, as in everybody-in-the-theater-claps-at-the-end excellent.It's basically not done in song and dance style. Characters are moving around and in action the whole time. There is some spoken dialogue, but it is done very much in the style of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, a movie in which 100% of the dialogue is sung. These are basically the only two musicals of this type of style or technique. In The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, you quickly don't notice they are singing at all anymore, and you go through the whole movie as if you are just listening to people talking or arguing, but in this Les Miserables, sometimes you don't notice that they are singing, while other times, well, they are definitely belting it out, but still within the flow of dialogue, and the action of the movie keeps going. They don't interrupt the action to stop and do a big tap dance and singing number or anything like that. In fact, you don't even notice when they are going from straight spoken dialogue and back to singing, sometimes even mid-sentence, and sometimes a character is replying to singing with spoken dialogue, as the two get mixed right in together perfectly.It you just want the Les Miserables story in a movie but without the music, then watch the 1997 version directed by Bille August, as that is a really good movie. (And includes stars Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes and Geoffrey Rush.)But remember, the musical Les Miserables has been more to the stage than what movies like The Godfather or even Casablanca ever were to the silver screen. It's number one, with more people having seen a stage production of Les Miserables than Annie, Cats, South Pacific, The Phantom of the Opera, Chicago, Rent, Miss Saigon, Evita, or anything else, and there is a reason for that and that reason is basically the music. Along with the story of course, but its music is really just that powerful.You could just watch a recording of some NYC or London stage production of Les Miserables on DVD. There are plenty of those, including ones that are hardly even stage productions but rather more so just opera singers on stage taking turns singing the music. But you aren't going to get a movie type story experience out of those. Just the same, no matter how well done, a good Broadway quality stage performance of Les Miserables is going to be 5 times better than even a perfect Les Miserables musical movie. This movie is produced like a movie and not as the filming of a stage production.A movie movie, as we expect it, sets its scenes wherever they need to be. When a character is hiking over the top of a mountain, they are actually there filming on the top of a mountain. That is how this movie usually is. When they are out on the streets of Paris, they are out on the streets of Paris. It's a movie. And it's the story well told. And it's the music. All in one.Putting all of those things together in one Les Miserables movie, well it's hard to imagine anybody doing it much better or even trying to. A few imperfections or weaknesses are there, but not enough for anybody to try to outdo it anytime soon. Some of the outdoor scenes could have been shot on a location in some French city or town, rather than having buildings or skylines look so much like stage sets or computer generated images. Next to none of the waterfront scenes looked like they were just shot on an actual location, with all sorts of ships and things looking like stage sets or computer generations. Some of the actors could have cut their cockney stage accents for just straight modern English occasionally touched with French accents or pronunciations as needed. (After all, they already weren't shooting in French, so why bother with any fake old timey stage accents that only make characters that much harder to understand?) They could have taken a page from The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and seriously stuck to realism and naturalism, rather than appearing as stage performers performing on a stage so much. There were some mighty wobbly cameras in a few scenes. Even if you are not big fan of Victor Hugo or of musicals, this should still be enough of an action and adventure movie to keep you well entertained. It's long, but that was something unavoidable in order to fit in both enough of the story and the music. Overall, it's excellent. A rare 9 out of 10 stars for me.

Les Miserables is not easily translated to film, as any fan of the novel or the musical knows. There are enough failed movie versions out there to attest to this. I think that this time, thankfully, they got it about as "right" as it's ever going to get.Don't get me wrong, it certainly has its flaws, but it rises well above all the other musicals-turned-movies I've seen with the possible exception of RENT. However, all things considered, I can only think of three substantial complaints and of those, only one is glaring enough to have a real impact on the movie's quality.Russel Crowe, who I am admittedly indifferent to in most movies, really managed to make the character of Javert unimaginably dull. He seems to be singing through an eternal yawn and although Javert is certainly not a character of high or fluctuating emotions, there are moments when something as simple as a facial expression would have made a world of difference. On the bright side, though, at least the man can carry a tune most of the time, unlike other stars cast in leading singing roles Gerard Butler...My other complaints are solely about some of my favorite lines that were omitted, so not even worth going into detail on, but it leads me to a commendable point: as long as the stage show is, this film did an amazing job keeping it intact! Not perfect, but so much better than I ever imagined. Very little was lost to time constraints, I am so impressed.The singing is appropriately unpolished, the cinematography is stunning, it was the best time I've had seeing a movie since I was a child. In many scenes, it feels like seeing the show for the first time no matter how many times you've seen the stage production. Anne Hathaway is my new favorite actress, she brought me to tears and I've never cried at a movie before. She really touches on a whole new depth to Fantine's despair, it seems almost impossible to see her performance and not leave the theater touched to the core.Hugh Jackman was an excellent Valjean, in my opinion. His Soliloquy portrayed the conflict of the character in ways I really didn't think could translate to film and the warmth of his character after his personal transformation comes across beautifully. The Thenardiers were laugh-out-loud hilarious, little Cosette was the sweetest child ever, the casting of little Eponine was surprisingly excellent, Gavroche was absolutely charming, this was so well done, I cannot sing it's praises enough. All of the students were excellent in their roles, I was particularly in love with Enjolras, but whether that's because the actor is excellent or because he's my favorite character in the story anyhow, I don't know for sure. He and Grantaire were so wonderfully suited to their roles, it was easy to forget that this wasn't a genuine stage production from time to time. I thought that Marius and Cosette, two characters who are pretty one-dimensional usually, were far more likable in the film than in any of the stage productions I've seen. Not the most outstanding performances of the movie, but the actors did a lot with characters who have so little content, so kudos to them.I live in a city full of pretty shallow people and not a single person I know around here had ever even heard of Les Mis unless I happened to drag them to the Twin Cities to catch a production when it passes through, musicals are NOT these people's thing, yet when the credits rolled, our theater erupted with applause. I was shocked! That alone speaks volumes to me of the quality of the movie and it's performances.On a side note now - look, I know how a lot of people feel, those who are longtime Les Mis fans and who have a hard time accepting some of this casting. In a perfect world, this movie would star Patti and Colm and Phillip Quast (all respect to Terrance Mann) and Frances and Michael, but this is one of those cases where we have to remind ourselves not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Or rather, don't let the ideal be the enemy of the excellent. If you want to listen to Les Mis, the 10th anniversary is a great DVD to grab, the casting is nearly perfect. But to watch Les Mis and to experience it, this movie isn't going to disappoint you. Happy viewing!

Les Miserables is the best movie I've seen this year As great as the Broadway show was, the film is better, more action the closeups. etc The cast is excellent HUGH JACKMAN should receive an Oscar for his performance as should Anne Hathawy wonderful performances Russell Crowe is excellent as well though his voice doesn't stand up to the others Auduence broke out in applause several times (rare in a NJ theater) After Hathaways moving performance " I Dreamed A Dream" " and "Master of The House" ( Sascha Cohen , Helen Bonham Carter hysterical,) and for Hugh Jackmans performance of "Bring Him Home"At the end received a standing ovation.. Long yes 3 hrs, never boring not a bad moment in film beautifully directed by Tom Holland and photographed.. The most satisfying film I've seen this year ( and there are many good films this yr) Note* Glad Colm Wilkinson Broadways original Jean Val Jean was included in a small part as the preacher.. Ot to be missed!!

I like theater, I like musical theater, and I love movies. I saw Les Mis on the stage, and thoroughly enjoyed it. But this is a different story (maybe pun intended).The good: The energy of the movie, the acting and singing.The bad: Hooper is in love with close ups. That's almost all he does. He is relentless in staying in too close, all the time. It's dark. The look and feel of the visuals is all dark, gritty, pock-marked, dirty, ugly. As another reviewer said, don't have the actor sing for the balcony when you are in a very close shot.The ugly: Hooper never relents. It's too rushed, too pushed. Ironic, in adapting a musical wonder, there is no visual rhythm, no ebb and flow to the pacing of the scenes and of the individual shots. We never come up for air.The secret: I couldn't take it, and left with an hour to go. Sat in the car and was more entertained on my iPhone.

I've been a long time fan of Les Mis, and as an avid film fan, I was obviously quite excited to see how such a long, powerful stage show could be appropriately transferred onto screen. I had been following the production of the film for the whole year, but it wasn't until I was finally sitting in the cinema that I realized this film was a masterpiece.First off, let me just say that the stage musical is longer (although it does have an intermission) and some argue that it is difficult to understand if you are not familiar with the plot. This film HAD to make some song cuts and some changes to make it shorter and more understandable. Director Tom Hooper had millions of Les Mis fans watching his every move, so naturally he would disappoint some people with practically every decision he made. The acting too, was superb. I cannot think of one actor in the film that wasn't good enough; even down to the last chorus role, everyone was great. The gutsy decision to encourage acting over singing has really paid off. The live singing would have gone to WASTE if they were going for a polished version. You can feel the pain of each of the characters. Standouts include Hathaway, Barks and Redmayne. I was not disappointed with any singing either. Even Crowe, with whom I had my doubts, had a wonderful husky voice to fit a husky character.The camera angles have turned some off, but personally, I hardly noticed them making a difference. I loved the camera-work in the King's Speech, and it works just as well here. The closeup shots have gained plenty of criticism, and I might say that this too is where I had some issues. I reckon the closeup shots worked wonders for the heart-wrenching solos, but for other times it felt a little awkward. Although I do understand Hooper's reasoning in shoving the poor living conditions in the viewer's face. The cinematography was great at the right moments, but at times I felt that the set could have been more spectacular. So much action happened in one set in the second half of the film, and I feel that if we saw more it would have added a dimension. The sets they did use however were terrific to the last spot.The new song and leitmotifs added work wanders to give the film an essence of something new for avid fans. I would admit it would have been upsetting if it was just the EXACT same as the stage show, because it has been seen so many times by so many people that they may have felt on familiar ground in the cinema.In the end, all I can say is that the film is a masterpiece of modern cinema, and will certainly go down as one of the classics of musical film. While it may not come to win too many awards due to strong competition in cinema this year, it must certainly not go down unrecognized; and word-of-mouth, as I have seen in it's two days since the release, will bring it further than awards ever could. Tom Hooper has done a fine, innovative job in adapting this loved musical. Under the wrong vision, Les Mis could have turned out much much much worse.

Director Tom Hooper charges ahead from his Oscar winner The King's Speech, with an ambitious adaptation of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, a story that has had countless of musical staging, with most people holding dear to their favourite interpretation of characters and scenes. Boasting a stellar star studded A-list ensemble, Hooper's version has ingredients that makes it Academy Awards contender, although the challenge may seem to be getting audiences to embrace this glossy version made for the screen, which is never easy for something that's been around for more than three decades.Set in 19th century France spanning decades, we follow the life story of the thief Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) through his time under duress serving hard labour under the watchful eyes of cop Javert (Russell Crowe), the latter adamant that the ol' leopard can never change its spots during the former's parole, only for Jean to be touched by religion when he was forgiven, and given a new lease of life to do good. And I guess you probably know the drill by now, that Jean goes on to be a successful businessman, still being pursued by Javert, encounters Fantine (Anne Hathaway) whom he saves, which the story going into the second chapter of saving Fantine's daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen), before making another quantum leap when Cosette, now played by Amanda Seyfried, discovers true romance with Marius (Eddie Redmayne), who is part of the student leaders on the cusp of launching another revolution.It's pretty much of an endurance marathon sitting through close to three hours, where unlike a musical or a stage play, you'd get an intermission. For starters it takes some getting used to, because every spoken word is sung (yes I know it's a musical) almost back to back, with the multitude of recognizable tunes from Work Song to Do You Hear The People Sing sung by the cast members, who have been put through singing lessons, otherwise one can guess how this would turn out if sounding less than professional. Hugh Jackman was fairly inconsistent in delivery, while Russell Crowe proved that he can't do this full time, since his Javert almost always came off quite one-note, and having a distinct lack of feel for the character. Anne Hathaway on the other hand, nailed it spot on with her I Dreamed a Dream, and is just about one of the best things in the film.Film as a medium to present musicals have always been a fascinating journey, because of the characteristics that come with the medium. With film, it allows for expansive sets to be constructed, taking on a more three dimensional feel to the story telling since it's not just being on stage in front of you. Camera movement helps to provide spatial content, with jump cuts also producing an equivalent effect if necessary to move the narrative from location to location in double quick time.But while the medium had opened up space, Hooper took on an intent to allow audiences a different experience, in putting us up close and personal with the performers. This is something one rarely gets in a staged musical because even the first row is a distance away. Hooper puts us just next to the characters with his plenty of close ups, that we probably get to see every facial expression and twitch as the characters express themselves through song. So once the actors open their mouths, we're put right there in the thick of the action, whether you'd like it or not. It makes for an engrossing watch, but for the quality art direction and lush production values to be appreciated, your eyes have to quickly dart around before the next musical number comes on.You'd have your own personal favourite scenes from the musical, and I have three - with the three way romance between Cosette, Marius and Eponine (Samantha Barks) which is ever so brief but no less making a tremendous impact, having Jean Valjean go up against Javert in every instance to allow one to determine whether Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe would fare better than the other when they sing, and the limited scenes in which Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter make their appearance as the thieving Thenardiers, providing comic relief for the very heavy themes and story line involving one man's redemption, rivalry, tragic romance, all against the backdrop of a student led armed revolt.Not having the luxury of sitting through a live stage performance of this musical, Tom Hooper has done enough to drum interest to a level high enough to want to do so when Les Miserables comes to town the next time round. Meanwhile, make do with this lavish production meant for the screen, and be immersed in a world and story as first envisioned by Victor Hugo, and adapted from the Cameron Mackintosh musical. Recommended!

This movie was an expansion of the musical rather than a condensation of the novel, but the musical was based on the novel, so either way it was Les Miserables. As with the musical it hit the highlights of the story in dramatic fashion. Most of the actors are not professional singers but their amazing acting ability compensated for any weakness there. It was an odd experience at first, to see actors singing their lines (with almost no dialog apart from the songs), and it took a little getting used to. At first I was thinking: I could have watched the musical in the comfort of my living-room with better singers - but I was wrong. Well, I was right about the singers, but these actors were able to bring so much more to their characters than the Broadway or London casts were able to do. The acting was superb. I did think Russell Crowe was a stand out. He had a difficult part to sing/play and did it beautifully and with powerful, yet subtle, emotion. It was a pleasure to watch his performance as Javert. Overall it was an emotional experience for all (we ranged from 12 yrs. to 62 yrs. old) and we all enjoyed it tremendously.

I love Les Mis. When I say I love it, I mean I know every single measure of every single song by heart. That being said, I found the "extra songs" to be awkward and grating. (But I don't think you would pick up on it if you don't know every single word...) Hugh Jackman portrayed Valjean very expressively and completely transported the viewer into the moment; BUT the role of Valjean requires a very adept signing voice as those songs have a lot of depth to them, Mr. Jackman just doesn't have the voice required for the part. Same thing with Russel Crowe portraying Javert. Some of the most intense, touching parts of the music were lost to less than adequate singing ability. Anne Hathaway, stole the show no doubt... However, I was also pleasantly surprised by Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, she wasn't the best ever, but was well casted and delivered quite nicely. Eddy Redmayne was a phenomenal Marius and has a surprising voice. The one role (albeit a small role) that I can't believe no one is talking about is Samantha Barks as Eponine... Wow! Filling the shoes of Frances Ruffelle was a big task (I am very biased in this area as Ms. Ruffelle is my favorite and Eponine is my favorite character)but Ms. Barks was stunning!! Overall, I loved it because it is Les Mis and it was done better than I could have expected from Hollywood.

The musical was almost flawless, even though it was a compressed version of a great novel that had a lot more to tell. This movie, trying to be an exact copy of the musical, fell short of expectations, and my expectations were not great to begin with. Some of the actors were chosen well but most of the A list actors did not act as well as their counterparts in the musical, which is a sad fact given that the musical performers are unlikely to be perceived as serious actors and I felt the actors in the movie did not tackle their roles seriously enough when they were known for more challenging acting roles in their careers. And yes, I am not even mentioning that a lot of them can't sing well either. Was disappointed that the movie chose to stick wholly to the musical. It could have done a lot more, by bringing flash scenes or background stories in the middle of the songs to bring more colour and depth where the musical can't do, instead of opting for the horrible prolonged effect of the camera close up on the actors face, and I mentioned before, some of them did not act at their best. That said, the movie had a chance to add extra flavour from the novel but did not utilize this to its advantage. The changing of the scenes were too abrupt, that the impression I am left with is akin to a series of MV,for instance those who are not familiar with the musical may find it hard to identify who was the little Cosette when she first appeared because the transition changed too soon without warning. and that took away a lot of emotional attachment that I rmb from the musical. Some of the best scores were right at the beginning of the movie itself but the actors somehow managed to ruin the moment. The ending was another letdown in comparison to the musical's far more inspiring version.

I am a massive musical fan and Les miserables it is my all time favourite musical even though i have never seen a professional company perform it live on stage. I have only see good quality amateur theatre companies and the 25th anniversary concert on DVD.The movie was incredible and a great watch. Hugh Jackman is outstanding and he made the character his own. I was nervous about Anne Hathaway as i didn't know if she could sing - well she couldn't of played the part any better and deserves every award that hopefully comes to her. As i am Australian i was proud that we had 2 Aussies playing leads in this movie but when i heard Russell Crow was playing javert i was a bit hesitant about the singing yes he looks the part and acted the part BUT the singing left a little to be desired a stronger voice was needed! The rest of the cast was great with massive wraps on Eddie Redmayne on his role as Marius and Daniel Huttlestone for his role as Gavroche. A Must watch and it did the musical justice will be watching it again tomorrow.

I want to start by saying that I love the book and I love the Broadway cast album of Les Miz, so I want into this movie really hoping for the best. I was very disappointed. Mr. Hooper has managed to make a grand, episodic story and semi-operatic pop opera appear to be much smaller than it actually is. He did that by spending so much time filming in extreme close up. And having the performers sing live adds little to the proceedings except in two numbers (I Dreamed A Dream and Empty Chairs At Empty Tables). The movie is also exceptionally miscast. While Hugh Jackman acts Jean Valjean extremely well, his thin, nasal voice lacks the ringing tones to make the character as heroic as he needs to be. Russel Crowe is awful. Not only is Javert badly sung, but he's not particularly well acted. Amanda Seyfried has a whispery little voice that makes Jane Powell and Kathryn Grayson sound like Birgit Nilson. And Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, both of whom I've loved in other projects, are a mess. The movie is inert musically and dramatically...until we arrive on the barricades more than two thirds of the way into the movie. It then comes alive. The men on the barricade are wonderful. Eddie Redmayne turns in the best performance in the movie and sings a truly heartbreaking Empty Chairs At Empty Tables. He and Anne Hathaway are really the best of the bunch. But most of the big dramatic climaxes to the musical numbers are absent because most of the music seems to be sung in whispers rather than full voice. What is so dramatic on stage becomes rather lackluster on screen. It's unfortunate that after waiting 25 years for a movie version of the musical, this is the best that we get. If you want the story, watch the version with Liam Neeson and Clare Danes.

I'm giving this movie 10 stars even though Russell Crowe sucked as Javert. Hugh Jackman was the main highlight as the protagonist, Jean Valjean. Anne Hathaway really brought Fantine's character to life. Amanda Seyfried did her best as Cosette. For the humorous side, you had funny man Sacha Baron Cohen(Borat, Bruno, Ali G, etc.)as the innkeeper, and Helena Bonham Carter as his wife. "Master of the House" was the BEST here in the movie version of the Broadway musical. Hugh Jackman's portrayal is completely genuine and emotional. Russell Crowe's unimpressive last song in the movie took messy end. The stage version of his "dive" was much better. And if you look carefully, Colm Wilkoxon, who played the bishop in the movie, was the original Jean Valjean in the stage musical. Wilkoxon represented Ireland in 1978 in the Eurovision Song Contest. Overall, this movie grabs your attention from start to finish. I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD. I'd definitely see this movie again, although next time in the morning, because night shows cost almost 12 bucks a pop.

After much anticipation, Tom Hooper's "Les Miserables" is finally here. And let me say, it's the best musical adaptation since 2002's Best Picture winner "Chicago".To call "Les Miserables" brutal is an understatement. It actually makes me feel grateful to have not lived in such a filthy time full of disease, prostitution, ruthless war, and utter disgust. To find true glory, hope, and heart amongst this backdrop is miraculous, but it is one of the most uplifting films you will ever see.Having seen the stage production several times, I decided going in that I would not compare the two, and I did not. They stand alone as two fantastic labors of love. One thing I truly admired about this film is that the singing was not prerecorded & lip-synced. What you hear in the film is the actors actually singing in real time and it added so much more depth and emotion to the songs. I found it to be a bold & brave move by director Tom Hooper (who won the Best Director Oscar for "The King's Speech"). "Les Miserables" actually tops his former film with passion & artistry.Most are familiar with the story but it tells the story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a paroled prisoner in the 1800s that over the course of decades, attempts to find redemption while a police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) pursues him relentlessly.As for the cast, all I can say is I was astonished. They could not have found a better John Valjean than Hugh Jackman. His acting is top-notch & his vocal range is magnificent & surprising. Anne Hathaway steals the first quarter of the movie in her mesmerizing portrayal of Fantine. Her rendition of the song "I Dreamed A Dream" is anguishing,heartbreaking,& desperate. She lost nearly 15-pounds for the role,cut her hair off, and vocally prepared for weeks. Hathaway doesn't just act like Fantine; she becomes her, with blood, sweat, tears, talent,voice, and art. It's her best turn since "Rachel Getting Married" (2008).I'm sure both Jackman & Hathaway will receive Oscar nominations if not wins (for Hathaway in particular).The Thenardier's are fun (played over-the-top by Sasha Baron Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter). Amanda Seyfried was a fantastic choice for Cosette, and the entire cast is a dream, really.Then there's Marius played by Eddie Redmayne (who I also think is Oscar worthy here). He comes out of nowhere & gives this astonishing performance, singing like a Broadway God. I was blown away. His performance of "Empty Chairs At Empty Tables" is agonizing, and perhaps the best I've ever heard it performed.The only tiny downfall to the cast is Russell Crowe's Javert. Crowe does not sing quite as well as the rest of the cast. His vocals are not as powerful. Javert is such a powerful character, and it seemed to need a bit of a punch. Still Crowe's acting is great as always & he gives us haunting insight into Javert, who ultimately is as much a victim as anyone else in the story.This is a massive production. I can't recall such a huge Broadway adaptation since "Evita" in 1996. Some have called it bombastic. I completely disagree. Director Tom Hooper has remained faithful to the Broadway production while somehow making this adaptation his own at the same time. There are many intricacies that could never be noticed on the stage. He has directed his fine team of actors in such a way that through the gritty, raw cruelness of the time we feel uplifted. The movie is incredibly intimate. I can't imagine anyone walking away unaffected.It's a movie of the heart. It's message of love, hope, giving, & surviving are inspirational & uplifting. Without a doubt, the best movie of 2012. It does not disappoint & is a definite must-see.

What an absolutely breathtaking film! I've never been into plays, yet after seeing the trailer for this movie, Anne Hathaway stole my heart away with her voice. Listening to her sing in this movie...her performance deserves a multitude of awards!!! The entire movie was an emotional roller coaster that made you feel so many emotions these characters were portraying. Not to mention the story line makes you realize how horrific their lives were in the early 1800's. By far, one of the best movies I've seen. Truly will make you think about life, love and the pursuit of freedom and happiness. My only complaint would be that Anne Hathaway wasn't in the movie enough. She was THAT good. Hugh Jackman managed to play by far, one of the most dynamic characters I've ever seen in a movie. His physical transformation over the course of the movie was beautifully done. Every single character in this movie touched upon my emotions in such a unique way, I'd recommend this to anyone.

If you've seen the stage version of this musical, it's unlikely you will find the movie adaptation satisfying. Russell Crowe and Sacha Baron Cohen are out of their depth vocally, and in the case of Crowe, this is a serious shortcoming. Even Hugh Jackman, who I believe is a consummate all- around entertainer, strains with the vocal demands of his role. Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne are lovely as Cosette and Marius, although they project little amorous fire. The smaller roles of Eponine, Gavroche, young Cosette, and Enjolras are very well cast. The editing is unnecessarily choppy, although I know this is the common model of today's filmmaking. There's no question the film is visually sumptuous, but the production never misses an opportunity to hit us over the head with the pathos, as if audiences are incapable of relating to subtlety. It is a sad statement that the appearance of Colm Wilkinson as the bishop makes one long for his performance in the role of Jean Valjean.

As I was a kid growing up in Italy, I remember when the national TV channels broadcast classical operas. Even as a kid, I could understand the efforts of the directors who had to work with what they had---editing in real time live stage actors. Obviously, movie directors do not have the limitation--- they can edit, dub, sync, use CGI, and move their cameras at will, in harmony or in counterpoint to the music. So, I was utterly disappointed when I saw that Tom Hooper did not achieve anything better than the old-timey Italian TV directors could do with staged opera.That is even more surprising because Hooper is working on Les Miserables---the longest-running, most beloved musical of all time. Les Mis contains some of the most beautiful, moving, and powerful pieces of music ever written. And its music is layered on one of the best and richest novel plots. With such a rich material available, Tom Hopper makes the odd decision in concentrating all of his efforts in beautifully rich scenarios and CGI reconstructions of Paris (one of which is bizarrely out of perspective), and filming every single solo as a more-or-less single shot of the close-up of the singer. With Anne Hathaway's performance, it kind of works, but it fails with everybody else. In fact, I found that this choice creates two kinds of problems. First, it creates an uncanny contrast between the intensity of the performance (strengthened by the close-ups) and the fact that, well, the characters are SINGING, even when dying. Somehow, forcing the intensity of the acting breaks the spell instead of strengthening it. Second, and most importantly, there is an unresolved tension between the music and the immobility of the camera. the music drives the feelings, and invites motion and changes. You want the camera to roll and open spaces, and, instead, you find yourself still staring at Hugh Jackman's wrinkles. One might say that this is some kind of ascetic directorial decision, but no---when the characters are not singing Tom Hooper abuses impossible camera work that zooms in and out at impossible distances, from the detail of a face to bird's eye views of Paris. So the reason for the poor filming of singing actors must lay somewhere else. Maybe the root of these problems is Hooper's much celebrated choice of having the actors sing in real-time. But, again, why was decision made in the first place? Since it causes problems in the final result, I see no point in recording the actors while singing live--- if not for bragging about it later on.So, in summary, the movie was disappointing. And good performances (or even great performances) cannot save a weak directorial work that fails to shape the richness of the story and the music. If the director was someone like the energetic Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge! and Ballroom), we could have had a real movie, if not a masterpiece. Instead, we got an expensive TV Christmas special.

A very well performance by the most of the cast member. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway deserve every award they have been nominated. Amanda Seyfried's voice is also surprisingly amazing. The set for the film is beautiful. Overall, a good entertaining for the price of a movie ticket.The problem of this film is the directing....Did the director have to shoot every solo scene in a close, only above-neck angle? Most of the vocal solos we can only see the head of the actor. You can actually imagine that Hugh Jackman holding his iphone in front of him when he was singing and the filming was done by skype or facetime. Especially in the last few scene his camera seems to be too small to fit in 2~4 characters. I don't get this. Probably he was trying to create some first-row experience for the audience, but when this fixed and focus angle was used through out the entire film it starts getting me annoying and make the movies very flat even it has a great storyline and awesome performances.I think it is a very well first-row entertaining experience. But this is not a very good movie.

I saw "Les Miserable" at noon on Christmas Day with my wife & grown son in a movie theater where well-dressed waiters brought sparkling water to our seats to go along with our hummus and eggplant dip. It was a much better & pricier film venue than we usually patronize, but it seemed appropriate, given our extraordinarily high expectations for the film. And besides, it's near my brother's home, where we spent Christmas.I did my homework preparing to see "Les Mis" critically, having spent dozens of hours singing along with various stage company soundtracks, and several thousand tickets at The Fabulous Fox over the last 20+ years. I downloaded the film's soundtrack a few days before Christmas, prompting a few snarky Facebook postings question Russell Crowe's contributions. I once even got a couple of hundred pages into an English translation of Victor Hugo's masterpiece (too many French names to keep up with, it turned out missed the music too much to read all the way through it). I read up a bit on France's June rebellion of 1832. At the end of the day, several things about "Les Mis" exceeded my expectations. Hugh Jackman & Anne Hathaway were even better than I anticipated. Samantha Barks and Eddie Redmayne were especially outstanding. Colm Wilkinson was delightful as the Bishop of Dinge. Amanda Seyfried & Helen Bonham Carter were pleasant surprises. Sacha Baron Cohen surprised me by putting his own effective spin on Thenardier. Many, many others made their old familiar roles fresh & new.My big shock was the success of Russell Crowe's performance. In the vacuum of the soundtrack, his voice seemed outclassed by his cast mates. On screen, however, his Javert was multidimensional & most satisfying. I've been a Russell Crowe fan since "Gladiator," & I was excited when his casting was announced, but after hearing the soundtrack I identified two big mistakes in this film's production: Hiring Russell Crowe, & not firing him after his first day on the set. He made it work with his screen presence, though.Not all the changes worked for me. Creative makeup designs tried to evoke the disease & the squalor of 19th century France, but came out alarmingly close to 21st century zombie apocalypse.All in all though, "Les Mis" is a winner. Les Mis devotees & musical theater aficionados have something new to love. If musical theater is your thing, this is your movie. If you are a musical theater neophyte & this film doesn't turn you on to the genre, don't waste any more money trying to catch the bug. This one's as good as it gets.

I have never read or seen Les Mis before, but now understand it's endurance on Broadway and as a classic piece of literature. This movie is more of an experience than a "movie" and my teen daughter and I left with much to discuss. Anne Hathaway's performance and singing were breathtaking and I still get teary just thinking about it. The entire cast deserve Academy Awards in my book-every character was believable, and created a simply breathtaking performance. It is simply not possible to gush enough. Bring your Kleenex and prepare to be blown away. The only problem both my daughter and I noticed (which was very minor) were the English accents displayed-french revolution should equal french accents, non? M'ais oui!

Les Miserables is possibly one of the best musicals ever written and up on the silver screen kids of every age can enjoy it! Of course there are certain critiques; The beginning feels kind of rushed, Valjean's early life kind of just flies by. The characters Fantine and Eponine's stories are a bit rushed as well and they each lose pieces if not entire songs but the point they are supposed to make is still relayed. The music is just as powerful as it was in the play or the concerts, and the acting was phenomenal. Anne Hathaway is a shoo in for victory when the Oscars role around. These new takes on the characters are as refreshing as a cool drink of water on a hot summer's day; They let you see different and new characteristics of their personalities (such as Fantine's hate or Cosette's resentment.) You cry at every turn with this movie, ten minutes in your tears are prickling your eyes and half an hour in you've completely succumb to the suffering and anguish of these wonderful characters. If you are watching this in the comfort of your home you cannot help but start to sing along to all of your favorite tunes. (I know I was having trouble remaining silent in the theater.) The costume designs were gorgeous (even though some might say that some of the female characters were heavily under-dressed for the times) as the red, blue and even grays of the movie catch your eye and you find yourself sitting back trying to take it all in, wanting every little detail to remain safe in your memory. This movie was well put together and very well casted as none of the cast disappoints in their portrayal of these infamously famous characters. Special props go to the newcomers to the silver screen Samantha Barks, Isabelle Allen and Danielle Huttlestone who definitely held their own with the seasoned actors of Hollywood. This movie gets nine stars out of ten because they left out some catchy songs, it could have been twenty minutes longer and because no movie is perfect.

On the positive side, I thought Hugh Jackman acted brilliantly, as did the rest of the cast. However, the way Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe sang, for example on "look down/prologue" was not strong enough to move you and impact you like it does in the West End. Now, I appreciate that the way they constructed the film was to have the actors sing straight into the camera and not to pre-record them, but I think that if they had they could have really given some of the songs a proper punch that would have really got the blood flowing. On other songs, feeling right up close and personal with the actors was special, such as when JVJ is in the first church. I think that this could have been tweaked for maximum impact: to turn up the impact of the real belters that should be loud (prologue) but allowing the more intimate songs to be done the way they were.Anne Hathaway gave a performance I didn't think she was capable of and I think she should be applauded all round. She was Fontein.Sacha Baron-Cohen was weak, he seemed to be unsure what accent he was actually putting on- it was a bit of a cross of Ali-G and some kind of joke French, which I actually thought was inappropriate and unacceptable for Les Mis. Yes, the inn-keepers are supposed to be funny but I felt Cohen ridiculed the role and made a joke of it. Helena Bonham Carter was her average self, she didn't really act at all she was actually speaking like herself. I come from the same area she does and I know how we speak, and she didn't really make any effort or change to that. Take it or leave it with her really.Young Cosette was absolutely perfect cannot fault her she sang wonderfully and really looked the part. Seyfried does actually have a wonderful voice which we all know from Mamma Mia! and the harmony on "heart full of love" really came to a lovely crescendo.I'm going to put this on a new line because Eponine was absolutely fantastic, sung beautifully and touched everyone- there were no loudness (or, really, clout) issues with her (as with Jackman and Crowe)- she was just right.I would like to have seen the blonde student (not Marius) with longer and straighter hair but that is my preference for the character, he was good enough. Marius also did enough but neither of them made you think "wow". At least they had the punch it needed on "red, the colour of angry men".Visually speaking, I thought the sets were wonderful and I did love that beginning scene when JVJ lifts the flag before he leaves was fantastic. The sets or CGI had that epic feel to them which was required and worthy of Les Mis. I wonder if they could have made the set behind the barricade with the big main window a bit more realistic, because even with suspension of disbelief there was no arguing that it was fake. It wasn't possible to make believe that street actually existed.I've seen better gavroche's.The final seen when JVJ dies was very moving and did bring tears to my eyes: the movie was woven together well at the end with the effect it was meant to have.Overall then, there were some extremely strong performances (Eponine, young Cosette, Anne Hathaway) some good performances (Amanda Seyfreid) some mundane ones (the students, Helena B-C) and some inappropriate and undermining ones (Sacha Baron Cohen) which actually detracted from the movie. The singing could have been far stronger at points- on the songs where loud and specifically strong renditions are needed, but the acting was excellent, especially Hathaway and Jackman, the former giving the performance of her life that she probably didn't even know she was capable of. There were some beautiful moments, when the main characters were singing at about three different points (Heart full of love, when JVJ dies...) and I thought the sets overall worked though behind the barricade was a bit too fake looking.I think that it was a nice thing to bring it to the cinema and I think they got about 80% of it right, but there was certainly tweaking to do. I like the fact they made the characters sing live, but I think they could have post-produced some of the songs that needed the extra punch. Indeed, perhaps it was the fact the camera was right up close and the director was going for an in your face approach at times which may not have worked for when we needed Jackman in the beginning to give us the feelings JVJ had. They could possibly have cut the scene in the middle when Jackman is with Seyfried in the carriage leaving their house, it carried on a bit too long. Also, Seyfried was a bit of a boring choice for the role I would like to have seen a fresh face for it. As I said, Eponine was fantastic. So, in conclusion, some characters (Eponine) were far stronger than others (Baron-Cohen) and they did get 80% of it right, but a few tweaks would need to be made to get it 100%, which I have mentioned throughout and in summary in this paragraph. Perhaps if the format takes off they will be learning and improving on it each time. I think they need to work on the interaction between the camera and the actors/set if they really want to get it right on one hand, and on the other make sure they get the right actors.

Having enjoyed several live productions of Les Miserables over the years, I awaited the opening of this film with great anticipation. That being said, if you are unfamiliar with the music and story, I suggest that you do your due diligence before seeing this movie. My partner and I listened to the music from the Broadway production several times, AND we also read several versions of the story line to refresh our memories.Just as our teachers used to say, sometimes it pays to do your homework! We both thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The outstanding cinematography and attention to detail added a new dimension to the production, and created a far different visual experience than I remembered from the stage production. The cast was absolutely superb! Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne and of course, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were just tremendous. Who knew that these "Hollywood Actors" could sing so beautifully! It was also great to see Colm Wilkinson (one of my favourite performers - The Phantom in the Toronto production of Phantom of the Opera)on the big screen.Thanks for a wonderful and enjoyable Christmas treat.

The title says it all! The only thing to add is that as a movie it's good but since the "musical" part of it is unconvincing it's about an hour longer than it should be.Don't expect Chicago or the Sound of Music!I have to admit that I haven't compared this to the old (1998?) version of Les Miserables (starring Uma Thurman?) so I will have to do so some day and update this review when I do.The good thing is that it has motivated me to go read some more about the French revolution - when did all the kings come and go exactly? How much of what is shown here is historically accurate?

The women totally kicked ass in this movie. Anne Hathaway beat all my expectations to a bloody pulp; she is officially a rock star musically.Samantha Barks was a revelation; I can't wait to see what she does next.Whatever project is wise enough to cast her, I will be sure to see.Amanda Seyfreid was infinitely better than I expected her to be; her inexperience vocally totally worked for her here, adding to her character's believability as an innocent, cloistered teenager.I wanted more development for Eponine's character, because just as in the musical, I found her to be the most relatable of all of the characters-certainly of all the female characters. The lack of extreme anguish in her character, the primarily silence of her suffering in a loud musical made it all the more poignant.I was tremendously disappointed the director cut the latter half of 'Turning', as well as his choice to include the incestuous-seeming, terribly-worded 'Suddenly.' The only real note I have on this film is that the director seemed too inexperienced, certainly too unaware of the layers behind the female perspectives this script presents, to do his job at a beyond merely 'satisfactory' level. Thanks to him, what should have felt like a revelation instead at times felt jolting and unnecessarily grim. This is a story about hope, not despair, and he seemed to linger in the bleakness with a troubling glee.The choice to cast Russell Crowe rather than an older, stiff-upper-lip, snarling and sneering at the "less moral" from his perspective individual was..not wise. That's been said already. Russell Crowe seems like a genuinely good guy, real down-to-Earth; his character is among the most difficult in the movie, and the actor clearly got little help either from the script which should have been edited to portray the layers of contempt behind Javer's interactions with Val Jean when Val Jean was still Mayor, for example, to make it more clear that Javer suspected Val Jean all along but could not speak up about it, due to Javer's station being so much lower than Val Jean's as mayor was.This, again, the director should have caught, as well as the simple fact that you cannot cast a novitiate, as The Phantom of the Opera's casting Gerard Butler in the titular role to flop reviews clearly evidenced to play a role that has been consistently offered only to the greats-with good reason. Russell Crowe was clearly trying, but receiving no help with his performance--it's not his fault he was miscast.That choice I blame sorely on the director.The choice to demand the actors speak lines which were originally intended to be sung was also a grave mistake, in my opinion. These lines rhymed--they made no sense as spoken lines. It seemed the director was just trying to include more dialogue in the movie for those who don't like musicals, but-it is a freakin' musical! They sing! Get over it.I mean that for the director as well.The choice to include 'Suddenly' was unfortunate. The director I suppose was trying to make his mark on the story, but the song came out all wrong for the script--too long, indicative of a romantic relationship between Cosette and Val Jean-ew!..awkwardly worded even for the romantic song it darn well seemed to be. A song filled with language like that belongs on a Britney Spears record, not in a musical.Did I mention that Hugh Jackman did his job here perfectly? Cuz he did.I can't imagine any other male acting in Hollywood today who could have performed this role better. Hats off.

I'm a big musical fan, but this (the 11th film iteration of the book with ever how many of those as musicals), as I suspected is a one and a half song wonder. The lyrics are good enough, but for most of the movie, all of the dialogue is set to musical notes placed in the score with a shotgun. Add to that the the subject matter, class warfare between snobs and "the miserables" with their hands out and chips on their shoulders. The only one I really liked was the little token French Oliver who was sharp as hell and had spunk. Anne Hathaway and ESPECIALLY Amanda Seyfried have superb voices, but the rest were only so so, including Samantha Barks who probably gets some sympathy points for her character.I think this franchise gets a lot of support from people (many of whom were applauding at the end), because it makes them feel that by doing so they're doing something for the poor. I'm just glad this wasn't a theater production where I'd have had to endure the endless encore applause with the audience and the cast all making each other feel good, thinking the story applies to modern Western Civilization in some way.

Les Miserables is my favorite musical of all time, having seen it nearly 40 times all over the country, I was really afraid that they would not capture the soul of this play on screen. I was presently surprised and was really feeling all the emotions throughout the movie. All actors were great and a real shout out for Samantha Barks who played Eponine, where has this actress been hiding? Her voice is utterly fantastic and she really did a great job of acting. My favorite surprise was the appearance of Colm Wilkerson who played the Priest in this movie version, Colm Wilkerson is known as the ultimate Jean Valjean with a voice that is known as the standard that all others are graded. Most nearly all followers of this musical would agree. The only disappointment to me was the voice of Amanda Seyfried who played Cosette, she seemed to only be able to sing in a very high range that did not always fit well with the scene, but her acting was very good. As a hard core Les Miserable follower, I was very pleased with the movie version and I am happy that many people who have not seen the play, but have heard the music will be able to understand the music better now as they can see the story more clearly. All in all, a must see movie!

I would say to anyone who loves the musical to give the film a wide berth, whilst the director has gone all out in reproducing the period and characters it is obvious from the start that the two leading male actors cannot sing to save their lives. Had the producers taken the route of making it a drama rather than a musical then it would have worked well but they didn't and never have two roles been so miscast. I don't know what the director was thinking when Jackman & Crowe were awarded the roles but they have the singing ability of a brick, actually that would be doing the brick an injustice. Anne Hathaway surprised me with her vocal range and both Sacha Baron Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter gave good portrayals of the inn keeper and wife respectfully, but combined with the efforts of the remaining cast they could not make up for the disappointing renditions by Crowe & Jackman. I rated it 3 starts purely for the visual effort, had it been based solely on the musical effort ....well...there are no "Minus" starts available.

I have seen Les Miserables 3 times as a stage musical. Each time it got a 10...15 minute standing ovation. Many people were crying. I have also read the novel by Victor Hugo (1862). This was a brave attempt by Director Tom Hooper to blend the musical into a sprawling epic film. And so near Oscar time...what a coincidence. When two of the leading characters don't do "there thing", then it is a struggle. Russell Crowe is simply mis-cast as Javert. His singing voice is not good enough. And--he makes a one dimensional character into a half dimensional one. Amanda Seyfried as Cosette is ....well lets be kind....not good. Her relationship with Marius (Eddie Redmayne) is like two frozen peas trying to get frisky. The cinematography is "experimental ?" . Like pushing a hand held camera into the singers faces at all key moments. Anne Hathaway will win the Oscar for best supporting actress...and that is fair. Hugh Jackman will probably win for best actor...but playing Jean Valjean is to carry a heavy load. His use of different singing techniques for each song was a wrong decision...disorientating the audience. I feel he saw this as a huge Oscar chance...and went for it. Perhaps....like some beaten athletic runners..he saw the winning post too soon. (some scenes did look hurried...) Certainly... here in Australia ...this has been hyped savagely. Two Australian actors in a huge frenzied "epic" !!!!!. Hype is a strange beast...you enter the cinema WANTING to keep in step with "public opinion". So...you walk out happy. If you want to get the real Les Mis.....See it live on stage. (no hype required)

As a huge fan of the musical, I have religiously followed this film through its production from behind-the-scenes to trailers to sneak-peaks. And let me tell you, Les Mis did not disappoint! From the very beginning and the first swells of the orchestra's music, I was hooked. And through the whole 2.5 hour movie, I was riveted.Singing: Everybody was great! Russell Crowe was not PHENOMENAL, but was excellent in "Stars" and "Javert's Soliloquy". Hugh Jackman, too, had his weak moments...but really wowed during "Who am I?" and "Bring Him Home". Anne Hathaway gave the best vocal performance, followed closely by Samantha Barks.Acting: A fantastic performance from the whole ensemble. Again, Anne Hathaway blew everybody else out of the water. Samantha Barks, Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were also excellent in terms of emotional delivery. And Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen were the much needed (and absolutely hilarious) comedic relief. Production: One of the best period films I've seen. The costuming, makeup, hair and set design were impeccable. I really liked how people weren't made to be "pretty" as Hollywood often does; thankfully, the actors' teeth were not left movie-star white.Overall, one of the best movies I've seen. I cried at least 10 times through the whole film, and the finale completely RUINED me. I was sobbing a full 15 minutes after the movie ended, walking through the theatre and out to the car.Highly recommended for everyone!

"Les Miserables" is the most thrilling piece of cinema i have seen all year. Director Tom Hooper, who won an Oscar for the "The King's Speech" has succeeded brilliantly in bringing the hit musical to the big screen. The only weak link is Russell Crowe who is a mediocre singer. His acting however makes up for it. Hugh Jackman is a revelation as Jean Valjean. His singing gets better as the picture progresses. As for Anne Hathaway they should cancel the best supporting actress category and just send the Oscar to her already. When "One Day More" started the my hair stood on end. I saw the stage version 3 times and wondered how they would pull this off but Hooper makes it dazzling. After the screening people cheered and clapped. The live singing was revolutionary but it worked. This is one the best films of the year and one the best musicals ever made. The finale with the entire cast singing is the most exciting ending you will see in a film this year. The order of the some of the songs have been changed but this is actually an improvement. Even if you don't like musicals you will like this film.

Les Miserables is a movie that will not be forgotten. Anyone who has seen (and enjoyed) the stage production will be engrossed in this cinema portrayal.The interpretation followed stage productions very well. Casting was phenomenal- especially for Hugh Jackman, who fulfilled my image for Jean Valjean perfectly and Anne Hathaway gave a brilliant performance (along with a wonderful singing voice. The rest of the cast portrayed their characters wonderfully.The scenery is undeniably a piece of art. The buildings, homes and barricade were amazingly real; costumes were completely true to that time period; makeup on the actors helped tell the story. Details (the sewer scene is an example) are one of the things that makes this movie great.For anyone who enjoys musicals (I'd guess that about 70% of the movie has dialogue that is sung, yet still easily understood and followed), this movie is a must see. I cried, I laughed (oh, those Thenardiers), and I was moved (especially by the closing scene, which was gorgeous).

There are few musicals like "Les Misérables," an operetta lined with incredible music from start to finish, with a story so grand and tremendous that somehow manages to fit on a Broadway (or West End) stage. Needless to say, Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil's story has been ripe for a film adaptation since the English version opened in London in 1985, a chance to place this larger- than-life production in an environment with no physical confines or limitations. With the keys in the hands of Tom Hooper ("The King's Speech"), one would expect something extravagant, but surprisingly, the Oscar winner chooses to do the opposite — to zoom in on the story and its characters in search of greater depth.It's this choice that completely determines the effectiveness of this take on "Les Mis." As anyone familiar with the musical knows, you're not going to walk out of any film version disappointed with the music and lyrics or the quality of the overall story — they guarantee the film a certain measure of success. Instead, it becomes all about presentation.Hooper's primary technique for telling this story is the close-up. If he and cinematographer Danny Cohen got any closer, in fact, you'd swear the camera would smack into the actors' faces. With so much of the music being sung by one character at a time — characters who are usually pouring their souls out — it makes sense, but there's little breathing room for the audience. Stars Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway and more are literally right there; the makeup department had to be utterly scrupulous to be sure. But Hooper doesn't just expose his actors physically, he also does so vocally. With the choice to film all the singing live on set as opposed pre-recording tracks in studio for the actors to lip-sync to, their voices become the object of audience scrutiny. With the lens so close on these characters, the actors had no margin for error in their performances, so it's truly a compliment to say that there is some truly incredible acting in "Les Misérables."Jackman and Hathaway excel the most with this technique as Jean Valjean and Fantine, respectively. Valjean is the protagonist in this large ensemble, a man released from prison on parole for stealing a loaf of bread, who after remaking himself eight years later, promises the dying Fantine that he'll look after her daughter, Cosette (played later on by Amanda Seyfried). Interestingly, their best work comes at the very beginning of the film. As the prison-worn down-on-his-luck Valjean who is given a second chance, Jackman sets the bar for the film's emotional intensity with "What Have I Done?" only to be outdone by Hathaway, who, despite minimal screen time, delivers the iconic "I Dreamed a Dream" with an intensity that really hammers home the lyrics in a way no previous renditions have ever done. It's incredible, though sadly it goes unmatched for the entire rest of the movie.Young up-and-comer Eddie Redmayne as student rebellion leader Marius and West End starlet Samantha Barks as the street urchin Eponine also succeed when the camera fixes squarely upon them in their respective songs "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables" and "On My Own." As much as the close-ups really highlight and enhance the acting, some members of the cast struggle with it. Russell Crowe has a lot of trouble with Inspector Javert, both vocally (at the beginning at least) and emotionally. He's a tricky character who's hard to empathize with in the first place, and Crowe just seems uncomfortable during his two huge solos. Opinions will vary on the overall sound of "Les Misérables" because of the choice to do on-set singing. Some lyrics become a bit lost when multiple people sing at once, and the actors generally choose to restrain their voices or even speak some of the lyrics rather than belt them, which given the choice and the film's intimate nature, makes sense. Great pitch is somewhat sacrificed for a raw quality that benefits the acting. The entire film is really built around the performances.Usually, when a film doesn't quite have the emotional impact it should wield, it's a lack of introspection and intimacy that can be blamed, but in this case, it's when "Les Misérables" fails to get big enough that it lacks that power to hit all of the story's several emotional high points. We never get that big sense of scale because of Hooper's preoccupation with the characters and that intimacy. The wide shots in the film are mostly sweeping pans to establish change in time and location, and they're very effects-heavy. It's odd, because what made "The King's Speech" such an excellent film from a technical standpoint was the way Hooper beautifully incorporated the scenery in almost every scene. The rich detail of the set decoration, props and costumes all came through. Here we can pretty much only judge the costumes from the waist up. Half the shots in the movie could've been filmed with actors not wearing pants and we wouldn't have known it.The trade off is that we get some of the very best performances in a movie musical of all time. These are star-making turns for Redmayne and Barks, and when you stop to consider at any point in the film that the guy playing Valjean also plays Wolverine, you'll have a whole new level of respect for Jackman. He and especially Hathaway will wow you like no acting performance has in quite some time."Les Misérables" has its missteps to be sure, but it's a worthy adaptation that utilizes its talent to impressively bring new insight to a stage musical heard and seen countless times all over the world.~StevenThanks for reading! moviemusereviews.com

Great musicals are all about magical moments. Anne Hathaway has THE moment with her performance as Fantine. Her rendition of "I dreamed a dream" is how songs are meant to be sung. It's not about pitch perfect notes but about communicating passion and emotion. I don't hear the music - I feel the pain, the sadness, the anger, and yet some remaining remnant of hope. I am still moved to tears just thinking about it. It is an experience - not a performance - Hathaway doesn't just become Fantine but makes me become her.The rest was middling (Cohen, Syfried, Crowe ) to very good (Jackman). I enjoyed the musical immensely and so did the audience at the theater we were at which burst into applause at the credits. However, it was Hathaway, who was on screen may 10-15 minutes total, who stole the show - and was one of those rare magical moments that people remember decades later...

Les Misérables, at first seems to leave a lot to be desired. I was almost completely lost and had no clue what was happening during the first half. Also, the shots taken were all at awkward angles, and everything felt very cramped. There wasn't space for the characters in the shots.Maybe this was just the theater I was in (but I really don't think it was), but the sound felt very empty. Hugh Jackman's singing left much to be desired and parts of the song were completely ruined. I know kids in high school that are more talented than him, in their drama programs. Anne Hathaway did surprise me a little and didn't do very bad at playing her character while she was alive.Later in the film was when I actually started to enjoy the movie. When Russell Crowe started having more songs, I thoroughly enjoyed them and was pleased to hear how good he was. Also Samantha Barks was an excellent choice for Éponine and consistently had a clear and wonderful voice. Her acting and singing fit the part exactly.The scenes and singing of the second half were much improved over the first except for Eddie Redmayne. As a vocal student listening to him and Hugh Jackman sing made me cringe every time. Eddie Redmayne singing from his throat sent shivers down my spine, and Hugh Jackman just didn't know how to sing.The only reason this actually got a semi-decent rating was for the second half.

As a fan of the musical, I have been waiting anxiously for the movie to come out. I was expecting less of the movie after, for example, the film version of "Phantom of the Opera". While this version did follow the play pretty well, it did sacrifice for a production over a musical. All in all, the vocals were very good, at least once you got past Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Sacha Baron-Cohen. In fact, after I got home, I dug out my 10th Anniversary DVD with the dream cast to drown out the memories of a couple of the vocals. Hugh Jackman did not do terribly, but his voice was a little worberly and he just could not do justice to "Bring him home". Russell Crowe just did not have a powerful enough voice for the part, especially in a song like "Stars". He just was not anything like Phillip Quast in the vocal department. Although the Sacha Baron-Cohen portrayal of the innkeeper was entertaining, it just did not hold up to the stage version. Ann Hathaway gave a very emotional performance even to the point that she took a very emotional song (I Dreamed a Dream) maybe a little too far. The lead women definitely outperformed the men in the vocal department.I thing the movie would have been better if the lead characters had been played by people who had actually starred in the rolls on stage. Of course, we need name recognition to draw people to the box office and the acting was quite good. The, shall we say, lesser rolls were obviously played by people who had a stage background and it showed. It would be impossible to find fault with Samantha Barks as Eponine but then she played the part on Broadway.With my few criticisms aside, the movie version was quite good and well worth seeing. For the reviews that complained about the singing of every line, hey it's a musical and that is the way the stage version is done. Do not try to compare it to any of the other movies based on the book. It is worth noting that the theater was the most quiet I have every heard during a movie except for the sobbing you occasionally heard. Yes, bring a tissue with you. And, do not come expecting to see the feel good movie of the year.I did enjoy the "grand finale" ending with the barricade that looked quite like the stage version. Although I missed it in the earlier scene, I noticed in the finale that the original Jean Valjean, Colm Wilkinson, played the Bishop. All in all, a very good movie that I intend to add to my DVD collection when it comes out.

I would first like to say that I've never been a huge fan of the musical Les Miserables. I saw it on Broadway when I was much younger and fell asleep and did enjoy the non musical version unlike so many others. Now watching the story unfold I can appreciate it's scope and complexity but I can't help but feel it's all a little dull, sorry. And I think that mainly has to do with the way its been executed this time around. After a brilliant first 35 mins reaching its peak when Anne Hathaway delivers a heart stopping, tear inducing performance of I dreamed a dream the film begins to flat line. Each scene less effective than the last. And the performances seem to follow suit. Hugh Jackman who blows you away in the beginning starts to come off too intense and forced, Russell Crowe although not terrible seems ill suited for the role and speaking of terrible Amanda Seyfred is just that she's so shrill sounding and has the emotional range of a stunted deer in headlights. Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also show up and deliver the films ghastliest performances with not an wink of charm. And as a pretty much a first timer of the material I can say most of it is pretty mean and dreary. Which is not a bad thing if it had been delivered with the panache that the film started with this could have truly been an amazing experience. Something raw, original and ground breaking. Instead we are left with halted promises as the we get further from the films powerful opening numbers after a while it all feels drab, lethargic and a little rushed at the same time. But I don't wanna be too mean to the film it has a lot of great moments and some truly wonderful songs that are performed exquisitely and it's no doubt that these actors have shown up with their game faces on too bad the proper direction wasn't their to assist them in making something truly special instead of another missed opportunity. ***/5

Instead of stating the things that others have said I would like to offer some impressions of the movie after my first viewing today. I was surprised by how much I loved the second half (1832) of the movie, mainly because I loved the performances by Samantha Barks (Eponine), Eddie Redmayne (Marius), Amanda Seyfried (Cosette - the single best singing voice of the cast), and Aaron Tveit (Enroljas). I also loved Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Sasha Boren Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter and Colm Wilkinson, among others. The cast is particularly strong.Most of the visual choices are excellent; a few scenes are shot too grandly, particularly early on, but this is a minor infraction. One has to allow for musicals to have different rules than dramas or comedies, so the "love at first sight" aspect of the relationship between Marius and Cosette is part of musical tradition.The criticisms I keep reading and hearing proved to be false: Russell Crowe's singing voice is fine, just not as strong as others in the cast; the close-ups work well for the songs; the "dirt on the fingernails" approach is appropriate for this particular story.The 1934 French film by Raymond Bernard remains the definitive version; 4 hours and 41 minutes allows for the whole story to unfold, and it is of course the most FRENCH of the versions. But this version is now my #2 movie version, largely because the cast performs brilliantly and the songs are so memorable.As for Oscars, I hope this film gets some major nominations, not only picture, Actor (Hugh Jackman), and supporting actress (Anne Hathaway), but I would like for Tom Hooper's direction and the performances by Samantha Barks and Eddie Redmayne to get nominations as well. It also deserves a slew of technical nominations.

Two things: 1.I am a film major so there will be some "inside" look 2.I am a big fan of the book, musical... was not great but definitely good enough to make a film (compare to Chicago which is not the greatest show of them all but the film version is absolutely amazing).But back to the "Les Mis": start with good things.Ann Hathaway is pretty amazing: voice and acting-wise;It is universal truth Hugh Jackman can sing;Sacha Baron Cohen is hilarious.... unless you hate him, of course;Aaron Tveit (Enjorlas), is absolutely charming, energetic and stands out even more than Marius There are really good songs there, even if you are not a big musical fan, and if you are - definitely go, just for the sound.Unfortunately, regarding the "good stuff" that's about it....Now, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS FILM:Back from the first trailer, I knew Russell Crowe was the beginning of the end...don't get me wrong, he is a great actor, but Javier?!?! The ruthless executor and absolutely negative character of the novel played by The Gladiator?! BIG BIG BIG casting mistake! You'll have to ignore this character throughout the entire film (not to mention he can hardly sing).Please stop talking about how great production design was: the makers of this film have forgotten they are not in the theater, you cannot get away with 5 sets, poorly CGIed Notre- Dame and french revolution somewhere in the corner. Script-wise, following the story-line of the musical, Fantine's part of the story seemed extremely rushed, which led to Valjean's affection to her absolutely unclear, the scenes where Jean was staying with the priest and stealing the silver later on, was completely neglected for the sake of Hugh Jackman's endless walking/singing back and forth in the chapel. This was an extremely important part of the story changing Valjean's character completely, and it was so poorly presented. In my opinion, some spoken lines should have been added, pure singing may work in theater but it always fails in film.Cinematography is abysmal. Period. It looks like they shoot on Cannon 5D. The image is shaky, constantly out of focus (unforgivable for the price of the movie ticket which was $13.5 in my case), Anne Hathaway's "I dreamed a dream" was one continuous shot which was a terrible terrible cinematic decision. And again, cinematography and production design made me feel ripped off... where did the big budget go? To convince Russell Crowe to play the part not suitable for him?And the last bad thing: stop shoving Helena Bonham Carter in every single film just because she has crazy hair. I don't even know what happened to her: after all these years of acting she looked like she had no idea what she was doing as Madame Thenardier. Not to mention she is way too skinny for the part. One more good musical was buried in ruins of bad cinematography... unfortunately for the fans, I'm only hoping they will not get their hands on the musicals I like.I'm pretty sure soon there will be actual viewers reviews with less stars and the deceiving rating (8 stars now which is over the top) will match the meta-score.

Firstly, I want to know how this film is getting praise? The most popular stage musical in history with an audience of over 60 million patrons has finally been filmed 27 years after it's first staging in London. It has been recorded in many languages and twice filmed as a concert, and so the expectations ran high. It didn't deliver! The songs have been re-written, re-ordered or cut completely. The Prologue is abridged giving little idea of back story or character. The music is subdued and singing gives way to speaking. Hugh Jackman sings at the top of his range for the entire film, Russell Crowe can't sing at all and appears as if he is aware of the fact; distracting when he is supposed to be a domineering character. He murders Stars; one of the great songs of the show. There is no light relief as Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter play the least amusing or threatening Thenardiers possible. Hard to ruin Master of the House but they succeed. The ABC Cafe setting is gone, and so we have no idea who the students are or why they're rebelling. Eponine's character has been reduced considerably. One Day More was placed after On My Own and instead of bringing the characters together, they separate leaving the "big" number without it's rousing finale. All reprises of Look Down are gone including Turning as well as Dog Eat Dog and the Thenardiers comedy song at the wedding. The singing is live, which in this case doesn't help. The only high point for me in this sleep-inducing endless monotony, was Anne Hathaway as Fantine. Her performance and singing are superb, even as she is singing I Dreamed a Dream after, her hair, and in this case teeth as well, have been sold. Boring beyond belief, I can't believe that anyone who knows the show well, could possibly enjoy this overwrought film version. The biggest disappointment in 30 years. Reviewers who are saying how close to the stage production this is, are deluded.

From the moment I first caught the previews of this film and noted the cast members I had a sense that this rendition might be superior. I have seen both the stage production and read the unabridged book and find that I just love the story. I can pronounce myself satisfied with this movie. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) and Fantine (Anne Hathaway) show their prowess as their vocal performances alternately soar and tremble and the tight shots add a tremendously powerful dimension to their sorrows. I particularly liked Valjean's Who Am I? and Fantine's I Had A Dream. Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) struggled a little with his vocalizations employing a certain brand of descant which I personally disliked but did not lessen the experience. Also the scene in the tavern with the students, including Marius with Enjolras and Courfeyrac, singing Red and Black, brought tears to my eyes. Actually, that happened on a few occasions. The Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen as M. Thenardier and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiess) were utilized as comedy relief for the most part and most of their very real viciousness was thereby dissipated. That I do regret. Cosette's very real misery at their hands is necessarily 'superficialized' for the film but there were many acknowledgements of the novel:Cosette's longing for the doll in the shop window and her being sent late to the well in the forest by Mme Thenardier are excellent examples. As is Gavroche's 'elephant home' with the other 'lost boys' of Paris. These may seem very minor but as a lover of the story I was much gladdened by their additions.Overall a magnificent film and a very satisfying adaptation of the novel.

So I know a lot of people will probably disagree with me, but in my mind 'Les Miserables' was a pretty dull affair. The direction seemed a bit strange, with far too many closeups during the songs, often giving the impression they were hiding a pretty obvious fake set in the background (the revolutionary fight scene near the end is a case in point). For the life of me I couldn't understand why Javert kept walking along precipices - perhaps there was meant to be a symbolism there, but Russell Crowe was so wooden its surprising he wasn't used to barricade the streets of Paris along with the doors and chairs. Anne Hathaway stole the show, with not much screen time, and following on from her strong performance in the Dark Knight Rises, where she again stole the show, it's hard not to tip her for Best Supporting Actress at any of the Awards coming up in a few months. Hugh Jackman and Eddie Redmayne were both good, though the real highlight was the comic relief provided by Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen (sans singing), whose scenes livened up what was otherwise, a long, overdrawn affair that could have done with a bit more spoken dialogue (even a minute of it would suffice!) rather than 2 1/2 hours of songs that were largely unnecessary. (THEY GOT THE MUSTARD OUT!)Overall, if you like maudlin operas that leave you melancholy and enjoy a complete lack of facial expression, this movie is for you. Otherwise, go and see Argo. 2 1/2 stars.

There are a number of problems. 1) Somewhere along the line they forgot this was a musical. 2) Some of the actors did a very good job of singing, Russel Crowe was not one of them. 3) Songs were shorted and/or deleted. 4) The conflict that tortured Javert and led to his suicide was missing.On the plus side were Anne Hathaway (Fantine), Smantha Barks (Eponine) and Daniel Huttlestone (Gavroche) who's performance and vocals were really great.The worst part is that a story about suffering and misery at time of the French Revolution was turned into a love story which completely destroyed the movie.The video was nice. Glad I went. Won't be buying the DVD of this one.

Les Miserables was written as music, not a classic stage play with dialogue. Therefore, first and foremost, you need people who have the vocal talent, musical background, and range to perform this. The director relied to heavily on 'acting.' It is the music that carries Les Miserables, not acting. Using Hollywood big names in any role may stimulate box office receipts but in the end dooms the production. Russell Crowe - a great Roman general, lousy singer. Hugh Jackman - should have stayed with X-Men. Eddie Redmayne - best of the group, but needs coaching to do Marius. Aaron Tveit - good but not the caliber I've seen on the stage. Similar comments for the other actors as well. This is a good attempt but falls short. The music as always, moves your soul, just overlook who's performing. I'm surprised Cameron MacIntosh signed off on the choice of actors.

I saw this movie on Christmas later in the day, and heard mixed reviews about it. So I decided to check it out myself. After watching it, I know I will go back and watch it again. I believe all the actor did a fantastic job. If you watch the play or read the book, I highly recommend this for you to watch. If was so heartwarming and you will like it. I believe Crowe was a great Javert but to hear him sing was kind of different. don't get me wrong, was a good choice, but watching him in gladiator and this Les Miserable, was different. I say WATCH IT. GREAT MOVIE!!!! We all clapped in the theatre and all cried at some part. You just want to sing along if you know the songs. Every moment was perfect.

After having seen Les Mis 5 times, in three cities on two continents, I was hoping but worried about a film adaptation. I have to say that I wasn't horrified, but also don't consider it a great movie. It was a decent adaptation of a great musical.Pros: Hugh Jackman's Veljean was credible. Not the best I've heard, but very good. Bring him home still resonates in my chest.Loved seeing Colm Wilkinson, the original Valjean, both early in the film and waiting for Valjean at the end. Nice touch.Probably the best Marius I have seen. Marius always comes across as a whiny wimp on stage, it was nice to make him a little more real.By adding in a few scenes, the movie would probably have been easier to follow for non aficionados than the theatre piece is.When it came to the big numbers, the movie ALMOST always came through. The final scene had half the people in the theatre singing along, and I've never seen so many people having to sit and get their composure before leaving a movie. Absolutely thrilling in that respect.Cons: I seem to be alone in NOT liking Anne Hathaway's performance. It just seemed too over the top, and it was NOT helped by the insistence on filming every song in tight close up. I get it, she'd had a bad life, and I get it, we gave them all makeup to look really poor and sick, but i really don't need to see every detail of their rotten teeth or messed up complexion. I found the constant tight close ups very annoying by the end.Russell Crowe? Meh. Could have been worse I suppose, but I found he was singing to the camera, not to the upper balcony, and with The Stars above or his final scene, it NEEDS to be sung to the back of the room, and both fell flat for me. Decent voice, but just not enough power when it was needed.Did not like Sasha Cohen at all, and had to admit that I was disappointed in Helena Bonham Carter. She added nothing of her own personality or power to the role. It was a competent performance, but not much more. Perhaps that explains the Thenardier's roles being reduced.I found the orchestration weak. When the music should have been rising along with the song, they didn't always bring it up enough. It seemed to get better as the movie went along, though, and for the mass anthems such as Do you hear the People, both singing and music were perfect.The last point I'll make is a big one for me, and that is the editing. I know this is a movie, not a stage production, but after a big number, there has to be a pause. Just a few seconds to let the crowd breathe a little. To jarringly jump to the next scene right after On my own, or Bring him Home, or 24601 just sucks all the drama out of it. All in all, a decent adaptation. Might even go see it again. But did they knock it out of the ballpark? No, not quite.

My wife and I saw this Christmas day at the local cineplex - a wonderful musical and emotional experience.Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, Anne Hathaway as Fontine, and Samantha Barks as Esponine deliver emotional charged, brilliantly musically acted performances.Tom Hooper (director) made a conscientious decision to have all dialog sung live while filming and it works beautifully. The emotion in many scenes is palpable! Anne Hathaway's "Dreamed a Dream" about a quarter into the film is exceptional and left very few dry eyes in the theater.Jackman, Hathaway, Barks, and Hooper should all win awards for this awesome movie.

I think I was less impressed with this movie than most people, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's just...different.This movie chose to go with an "acting first" approach to the songs, meaning that they were sung on set, and the actors had the freedom to express the lyrics however they wanted, and how you feel about this decision will greatly affect how much you enjoy the movie.Personally, I think it was a neat idea, but hinders the enjoyment of the music and pokes holes in an otherwise tight musical score.This musical was written to be a stage show, and the songs written to be sung as if they are songs- not acting soliloquy. To miss melodies that belong in the song because the actor "went a different direction with it" felt like a bad trade. Most notably, Valjean's songs have a sort of rambling, unprovoked nature to them- and in many cases the "acting" style of performing them feels awkward or forced.What the director didn't quite count on, is that people don't naturally sing their feelings in real life. So trying to make a show "more realistic" by making the songs seem more extemporaneous doesn't work- it just makes the *songs* feel less structured, but it doesn't make the fact that they *are singing* more believable.It's still a cool idea, and it might have worked...for a different show. This musical doesn't give the actors motivation to sing rather than speak because it doesn't need to; it's always singing; that's the suspension of disbelief that we make going to see this show. The movie tries to add that motivation, and then gambles that it can do so if it makes the songs less "song-like"- sort of like each song builds from emotional talking to full-blown signing. Some songs lend themselves well to this, but the musical already exploited that device for those songs. Forcing it to others just feels...well, forced.Another gripe I have is how they changed the words of many lines. A couple lines might be easier to understand now, but many of them feel overly simplified or dumbed-down. What also hurts here is that often the new words are less lyrical than the original- the words just sound wrong, or too casual.My last complaint is how they changed the musical score of the prose. Les mis is a musical that re-uses melodies a lot as is, but they take it even further in the movie. We become a bit over-saturated with some of the musicals best melodies- which is too bad.All that said, many of the best songs are faithfully recreated her on screen. Anne Hathaway is perfect (and I say that as someone who is not a fan of Anne Hathaway). All the women are wonderful, Enjoras is also wonderful, as are the supporting actors. Jackman and Crowe are great actors, and it shows. They both know how to sing, and that shows, but I miss the voices I'm used to for songs like Who Am I and Stars.Ultimately, I was disappointed because I wanted what I already had- the musical. The movie will definitely appeal to musical fans, though, and perhaps newcomers or people who are ready for something different will enjoy it more than I did. Just be warned- you are not getting the Broadway musical here- you're getting a "hollywood gritty" version of it.

I love Les Mis, both the book and the musical. I found Liam Neeson's ValJean and Geoffrey Rush's Javert compelling and very well acted. But I did not like this movie.There were two main problems. 1) Russel Crowe as Javert and 2) Tom Hooper's directing. The former is clear, his voice was distractingly bad and made me look forward to the end of his solos, which should be among the most powerful and moving in the story. Enough said - he was bad, but I expected this going in and was prepared to look past it.The part that I was most disappointed by was Tom Hooper's directing. For all his much lauded "live singing" method he didn't use it properly in the film at all, to the movie's great detriment. The place where the benefit of live singing was most clearly seen was in the introduction. In "look down" we have a dynamic scene where the character's breathlessness ties into the song and makes the whole performance wonderful and believable. Unfortunately, from there it felt flat.The rest of the movie consisted of EXTREMELY long close ups of the soloist while they stood absolutely still. Watching an unmoving close up of Fantine's face for 5 full minutes while she sings her Opus may be an artistic choice, but he does it in EVERY DAMN SCENE. I'm not sure if this is born from the desire to directly transpose the musical to the screen (a mistake) or a necessity due to live singing restricting the actor's movements and the dynamism of the scene. Either way it ruined the movie for me.There was so much wasted opportunity for character development and visual intrigue that was not realized due to poor directing. In "empty chairs", show us some scenes of Marius's friends, show us more of the aftermath, for God's sake do SOMETHING other than a 5-minute long close up of his face while he sings. This is a MOVIE, you have an opportunity here to bring more than the musical can achieve. Instead what we saw was more like a PBS special live-stage filming of a cast that was only adequate at singing the songs. Maybe it would have worked better if the A list stars had all been virtuoso singers, but I doubt it.The only bright spot was Anne Hathaway. I checked my watch for the first time less than an hour in. Tom Hooper wasted an opportunity here with no scenery, no dynamism, no development...a disappointment. Next time let's let someone have a crack at this that understands film as a visual medium.

Personally, I felt that the movie was fantastic. Anne Hathaway's performance was nothing short of sheer brilliance. "I Dreamed a Dream" was a very different interpretation from what was usually done. And I honestly think it worked so much better. Well, maybe not better. But it certainly was a stand-out moment and fit more into the movie.Samantha Barks was great as well, but that was expected. She's done the part before and her voice is gorgeous.While Russell Crowe's voice wasn't particularly strong, I felt he gave a great performance because his acting was spot on. Many people tend to complain about his acting in this film as too stolid and not much there. But I honestly blame the writers for that. He did the best he could with what he had. The show doesn't really give us much in terms of Javert. He's the stolid and righteous villain doing what he believes to be right. In that respect, Crowe gave a wonderful performance.As for the vocals not being up to par, I could care less. If you ask me, the piece was directed wonderfully and really gave it a gritty feeling that it should have. The stage show is a different entity completely. I don't feel like they should or COULD be compared at all. On stage, suspension of disbelief allows us to put aside the fact that the performers are trained singers that are singing their hearts out. In film, it's too intimate for that. That's not what Tom Hooper seemed to be going for. He seemed to be going for the grit. In the setting, gorgeous singing would be out of place. He made the show about the story and the acting. It gave it another level to play. So, if you don't go looking for beautiful singing, this really is an amazing movie (Hugh Jackman's "Bring Him Home" aside because...let's be honest, that was just awful on all levels.) Overall, I felt it was an amazing film. Sure, the vocals left more to be desired at points, but this adaption wasn't about the vocals. I really encourage everyone to NOT read reviews before they see the film because it may give them an opinion that they find themselves agreeing with before they even see the film to make their own opinion. I really feel that viewers should make their own opinions of the film.Of allthe films that are out right now, this is the one to see.

Hey guys! I just got back from a special advanced screening of Star Trek Beyond (not advanced by much, I know!) here in Australia. I have to say, the film was great! In short, it fits snugly within the "Abramsverse" and pays homage to the original series quite well. Whilst I did have a few gripes, overall the film is quite good! Before I get on with the review, I'm going to fully disclose a few things. Firstly, I never saw any of the original films or the TV show (however, I know most of the references etc). Secondly, I was a massive fan of the 2009 reboot and can confidently say it is one of my favourite science fiction films - J.J. Abrams delivered a film that was both visually stunning and successfully rebooted a timeline in an extremely efficient and clever way that I now hold as the standard whenever I see a reboot. Now that that's out of the way...Director Justin Lin (known for his work on The Fast and Furious franchise) is new to Star Trek and Sci-Fi in general. Going in, I was worried that he couldn't handle the elements that go into making a great Star Trek film and wasn't familiar with Sci-Fi elements. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Lin directs the film at a breakneck pace - but with a pretty big issue, which I'll touch on shortly. As a whole, the film feels very complete and tight with no loose ends. Simon Pegg and Doug Jung's script is excellent, balancing solid action sequences with a surprising amount of heart and humour. It is very evident that Pegg's gifted sense of humour shines through the script resulting in some genuinely funny moments - particularly several interactions with Bones and Spock who go off on a little bit of a side adventure. The old cast are amazing as always. Chris Pine as James T. Kirk turns in an excellent performance that brings the character arc of Kirk full circle from the first film by playing Kirk as a more mature version of the character that we saw him in the 2009 film. As for Spock (Zachary Quinto), his arc primarily revolves around his relationship with Uhura (Zoe Saldana) which I was a fan of as their relationship wasn't as fleshed out in the earlier films. Bones (Karl Urban) and Scotty (Simon Pegg) are both excellent here, but are mainly used as comic relief. Onto the newcomers - both Idris Elba and Sofia Boutella are great in the film and make fine additions to the already brilliant case. Boutella plays Jaylah, an alien who the crew meet while stranded on the planet that Elba's character maroons them on after destroying The Enterprise. Jaylah is an excellent character who provides a few laughs but, as Kingsman fans would know, knows how to kick ass! She brings another level of physicality to her fight scenes and has an array of gadgets which make the action scenes fun to watch. Elba on the hand is a great villain and I certainly liked what they did with his character toward the end, he brings a certain menace to his character that was missing in Cumberbatch and Bana's villains. On a technical level, the film is stunning visually with brilliant CG and an amazing score once again composed by the brilliant Michael Giacchino. However, I felt that the action sequences were sometimes poorly shot with the framing being too close to the action making it hard to make out who was who and where they are geographically within the shot. This also results in a lot of shaky-cam which is not very appealing. Additionally, the film suffers a bit of a slump during its second act and does tend to drag. This is very noticeable because the first and third acts are amazingly done and come and go with a very quick pace, particularly a VERY fun third act which involves a great call back to the 2009 film with Beastie Boys' - Sabotage.All in all, Star Trek Beyond is another excellent film in what is now an excellent trilogy. Justin Lin has made an excellent science fiction film, full of action and heart that fits very well in the pantheon of the better Trek films within the sprawling franchise. The fan service also toward the end was also a nice surprise to those who have followed the franchise from the TV show and the original films. I give Star Trek Beyond 8 out of 10!

No words can describe how amazing this film is! The prologue was a heartfelt sequence that gives us insight into Kirk's thoughts on the long span of time they were in space on their mission. The first part of the movie was an intense action sequence. Really heartbreaking to see the USS Enterprise being torn apart in that fashion. The movie was quite unpredictable and kept us on the edge of our seats. I would say, compared to the first 2 films, this film had no super impactful emotional scene. (that made me tear up) Probably because the scenes were too intense for tears to come out after that. The film ended with a lovely tribute to the old Star trek crew, Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin. The Star Trek films just keep getting better and better! Not going to spoil too much, so just go watch this in cinemas!

I'm back from watching the premiere of the movie in 3D and I'm extremely angry - mostly about myself in this case because I feel so stupid for actually thinking this might turn out well. I wanted to like the movie, I really did. Star Trek 2009 was okay even though it threw the canon out the window. Into Darkness was mess with lots of plot holes that was a disappointment in the end but at least watchable. This however is a nightmare visually. But lets look at it from the beginning. The first 5 minutes are looking okay. There is a bit of exposition, humor and some basic action and the movie looked promising.Then the movie really started and the thing that immediately annoyed me was that everything was shot in extreme darkness. It was hard to see anything properly. The 3D made things even worse, because it made the movie even darker because of the glasses. In addition I got headaches due to the extreme shaky cam. It was dark, shaky AND there were LOTS of close up shots so the action scenes in short are freaking terrible.The camera couldn't hold still for a second and this went on for 25 minutes. When the movie went back to focus a little bit more on characters and story the shaky cam stopped it became a bit better, but for me the damage was already done. The movie succeeded in p****** me of. Oh and the action scenes in the later parts of the movie have the same problems - shaky cam and very dark. You couldn't even see the ships properly. I felt like the director/camera man didn't really want me to see the effects properly - maybe because they weren't that great. It was hard to tell though due to the reasons mentioned above.The sound and music are average. The cast did their job well enough and the humor worked for me for the most part, but it's not enough to save the movie overall. It just made me give it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1.In addition the story is not that exciting. The things that are happening (especially in the finale) are very predictable. The main villain pretty much has a basic revenge thing going on. However his plans don't make much sense if you start asking questions. AND there are a lot of plot holes so that the things that actually happen don't add up. People get to places so quickly that you have to ask yourself "How the hell did he do that?". The movie won't answer the questions for you though. Things just happen and they happen quickly.Overall I had high hopes for the movie after seeing the last trailer and I thought I could really get into the J.J.Verse. But I guess this Star Trek is not for me. I'll go back to older shows and movies that were mostly fun to watch even with the problems many of them had.It's funny though. I watched Warcraft and loved it while it got destroyed by almost every critic. This movie is highly praised and I hate it. What a twist...Last I just want to mention - 3D is terrible. The last movies I've seen in 3D I've always thought that it's a useless gimmick that no one needs. Please stop pushing this terrible technology down our throats. Tell a good story and people will watch a movie.

*At first i have to apologize: Sorry for the bad English, I am not a native speaker.*I am a big fan of the Star Trek Series and when I was young I loved the old series and movies. When in 2009 the first "new" Star Trek movie arrived I was excited about the good cast and the intelligent Plot. The second one doesn't have this tricky intelligent story the first film has, but was also a good movie. The Third one with the sub title "Beyond" is unfortunately more like the second movie, but pro's first and here we go. Star Trek Beyond from director Justin Lin, who is known for Fast and Furious, bring some good action on the big screen. In "loud" moments Lin is in his element. Lin knows how to make some good dynamic action scenes. My personal Highlight is the Enterprise fighting scene with Beastie Boys – Sabotage underlaid. This part of the movie is very entertaining and in these points the movie has his great strength. Also so the Cast is very lovely and with Sofia Boutella as Jaylah there is another coherent likable character. The whole cast perfectly matched and I hope to see all of these guys back in Star Trek 4 (a silent minute for Anton Yelchin, Rest in Piece!). So the action is strong, the cast is strong, whats wrong with the movie? Why it is not a 10/10 for me? So I think the story is the first problem for me. I can't help me, but the whole story is for me more a reason to go beyond different places, then a real continuation of the Star Trek saga. The hole film feels like a episode of the series but in a negative way. There is a bad guy who is bad and good guys who are good. Lin just manages not quite the whole to give it more depth and make the plot more interesting. I don't want to Spoil anybody, but the motivation of the antagonist is not very resourceful in my opinion. We all know why Captain Kirk and his crew do what they do, but there enemy is a little bit "flat". Maybe I don't get it right now or doesn't understand the big point and when I see this movie a second time I will find it, but for now Beyond has the weakest Plot. The second Point is very subjective, but for me the tracking shots were a bit to fast so that the motion blur make some whole scene not pleasant. Maybe the 3D supports this effect, but the many "moving the camera" in a circle about objects and characters were a bit too much. I never become Motion sick in any Movie. I saw the movie "Hardcore Henry" without motion sickness, but in Beyond there were some moments I have to close my eyes. With 48 frames per second I think this problem would be fixed, but with cinematic 24 frames a second it was not perfect in my opinion. Otherwise you become a typical Star Trek movie and it is fun to watch it. I think it is a Cinema Cinema Film, so watch it on the Big screen with good sound. So guys please don't hate me, but in my opinion this is the weakest one of all 3 Movies. Please don't get me wrong. "Beyond" is not a bad movie, but it stands like "into darkness" in the shadow of the brilliant first "new" Star Trek movie. So the "genre-rating" for fans is around 8. For everybody else it is a solid 7 out of 10.

The first movie of the "trilogy" is by far the best one... the second one was a bit worse... and this last one is slightly a disappointment...There are just too many plot-holes and logical fallacies. It is way too predictable, without any turn of events whatsoever - this is just a standard script movie. It has very good special effects, but still it doesn't change the fact that the writing is taken from a B class movie.Spoiler alert! in the order of annoyingness...1. Really?! blasting bad songs on VHF waves on 50 MHz into space causes ships to explode... gimme a break please... yeah the visual effects of the exploding ships looks cool, but it's one of the stupidest things I have ever heard... 2. On the station they still can't use teleporters to catch the bad guy? only Kirk is the only one on the whole goddamn station who goes after him? no more flying "cars"? 3. Uhura looks at a video for a fraction of a second and instantly recognizes the bad guy? * well that's convenient 4. Really teleporting anyone is impossible from point A, because of interference, but if they move ~100 meters in plain sight to point B, suddenly you can teleport 20 guys at once? and then you teleport 2 people instead of one while they are falling mid air... because they were holding hands... that's cute :) 5. On the space station, they say that the Enterprise is the most advanced ship with the most advanced sensors, and it should be the one to go into the nebula. It gets destroyed, but at the end-movie they have the technology to build it from scratch on the same space station... meh maybe I over-think things...Standard script: Bad guy wants to blow up something, good guy gets his ass kicked then miraculously manages to go after the bad guy and win... nothing like the unexpected destruction of a whole planet in the first movie... But in the end, you should go see the movie... if they lose too much money, maybe they won't make a next one, and I really like Star Trek :P (plus, Sofia Boutella seems to really act well)Please make a proper script for the next one... Thank you!

It's a disappointing addition to what has been a very solid franchise so far. The crew of the Enterprise blunders into trouble because apparently none of them have any common sense. The trouble is resolved in a way that is more comical than legitimate, and it really doesn't work.I take a bit of an issue with plots like this because we know that there's no stakes. A Star Trek film needs a specific cast to appease people, thus, we cannot truly feel scared for these characters. I know we need conflict to create drama, but I just feel like it could have been done a different way.This film opens with a five-minute long voice-over by Kirk. I know that we need to learn about what has happened to the crew of the Enterprise since the last film, but we could have done it in a way that isn't such a massive chunk of exposition. This glacial pace and exposition- heavy dialogue doesn't let up until the second act turning point, but by then, it's too late to drag this film back from the breach. Although the third act is a semblance of a saving grace, it's just not enough to help this film maintain audience interest.There's some neat spaceship stuff that would be worth seeing on the big screen, but in all, this film is a disappointment.

The Enterprise crew is back for more adventure. After a divisive follow-up that is "Into Darkness", I am proud to say that the third installment of the newly-formulated Kelvin timeline (the J. J. Abrams movies) is a worthy addition. Where the next trek goes brings the Enterprise to its knees, as they are attacked by a merciless leader named Krall (a menacing Idris Elba). And landed on a hostile planet, the crew must stop Krall from his evil deeds.If you are a devoted follower to the saga, you may observe the repetitive pattern (wherein Enterprise gets attack by a baddie with resentment to the Federation and must stop his/her huge plans of mass destruction). "Beyond" applies the same pattern but to surprising effect. It can be lauded to Justin Lin's effort to lend his flair for blockbusters – as seen from his Fast & Furious movies – and apply them to the Star Trek universe without sacrificing its heart and soul. And that comes from the Enterprise crew on adventure mode, for this new "Star Trek" feels like a full-length TV episode. It proves that Simon Pegg knows Trek flair when he and his co-writer wrote this down.Well, it can be attributed that this is a mandatory tribute for Star Trek's 50th year anniversary, but as a stand-alone feature, it is a whole lot of fun. As the visual spectacle has been consistent, the cast this time has more chemistry and screen time, with Chris Pine as Kirk striking solid, Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban and Dr. Bones as an effective duo, Anton Yelchin finally having time to shine, and newcomer Sofia Boutella in breakout mode after "Kingsman".Yet, despite the fun, it cannot help but make this a bittersweet entry, as this is where the late great Leonard Nimoy was given a well- deserved salute, and this serves as Yelchin's posthumous performance. Fitting to this celebratory part of the franchise. While Trekkies and non- Trekkies may see this as a loss, it should not stop "Star Trek Beyond" from being an epic adventure that truly respects Gene Roddenberry's creation and gives it a breath of fresh air. This adventure boldly went where no man has gone before (even though it means repeating itself).

First of all I'm a Trekkie, and I love Star Trek beyond this movie. I'm not going to go deep into all of the plots holes that bothered me. but here are a few.SPOILER ALERT.So people ejected all over the planet, but magically found each other like if they were in the same shopping-mall. Perhaps that planet wasn't that big after all? The key to ending the battle was a simple UHF signal carrying loud music? Come on, an advanced cybernetic technology that brought Enterprise down in a few minutes start blowing up by itself just by exposure to UHF signal? I wish they would have tried a bit harder. I can think many ways how they could have carried out their attack — perhaps having found some other artifact on the surface of the planet that disrupted the swarm.The end game when three ships, including Krall's ship — that somehow managed to avoid the deadly effect of the Beastie Boys song — got into this big station/space city Yorktown. Now with all the technology available to the StarBase itself, couldn't they just teleported Krall outside the station? That old piece of junk U.S.S. Franklin managed to teleport the entire Enterprise crew, but they couldn't teleport Krall — or at least the artifact — out into space. So they had to open a huge airlock into space. Mind you a pressure release like that would have caused a significant damage to the structure of the StarBase(Yorktown), accelerating it in the opposite direction and creating a massive inertial force. I just can't buy the inertial dampener theory in that instance. Beside these plot holes there is one more thing that bothered me the most. All of the CG sequences where they had alien solders walking around, the animation was done very poorly. For instance in some scenes, the movement of their feet was out of sync with the movement of the ground — kind of giving an illusion of Michael Jacksons moon-walking — that's really embarrassing. Further in some sequences they moved like robots, which they weren't — at least that wasn't my understanding.But the movie in whole was good. I love the actors and their performances. What can I say, I love Star Trek even if it's bad.I give it a 7 due to the animation issue I mentioned above.

I've been a Trekkie since I can remember and I happily watch any TV show or movie, repeatedly, even the fan funded episodes with the eagerness of a true Star Trek fan. Without complaint, just happy to have it.With that out of the way Star Trek Beyond, for me, was a super cool movie. It was action packed, funny and with some outstanding special effects. I am so thankful to J.J for reigniting the series, and even though we now have a new director, it still had the wonderful light adventurous feel and look, (even the lens flares). It had some great scenes, some poignant and reflective, others just plain funny. Lots of in-jokes and a few pop culture references. I had to chuckle at the Comandeer Paris line since I am currently watching 'Voyager' in my spare time. And the scene with Spock and Dr McCoy on the planet has become my favourite Star Trek scene, EVER!!!So, if you're after a great fun time at the movies go watch Star Trek Beyond. I can't wait to see it again. So being a 'true Trekkie' I give it a 10/10

When I saw the first trailer somewhere in the beginning of this year, I didn't quite know what to expect. It was just action but it never revealed what the story line was gonna be. When I read that J.J. Abrams was not gonna be directing this one but Justin Lin, I was somewhat afraid the 3rd Star Trek was gonna be like Fast and Furious in space: "To boldly race where no one has raced before". I mean for a fast action movie without a real story line, Justin Lin is your man. But doing a Star Trek movie is playing ball on a much higher level. But how wrong was I. Last night I saw "Beyond" on premier night and it really blew my socks off. This 3rd part really exceeded all the expectations I had. This movie really is Star Trek worthy. Compared to the first movie (2009) all main characters have really matured. The have really grown in their parts. I'm not gonna name them all separately, they all gave a great performance. Idris Elba played Krall in the same way as Benedict Cumberbatch played Khan in "Into Darkness", very convincing. And Soufia Boutella as Jaylah? Let's just say she is a real kick ass alien. Simon Pegg and Doug Jung wrote a hell of a script with just the right balance between the action packed sequences and humour, even in the music, but there was also room for a few really nice tribute to the original Star Trek crew. What the story line is, I'm not gonna reveal, you'll really have to see for yourself. But I promise you that as a Star Trek fan, you won't be disappointed.

Easily the best of the reboots, and amazingly (as a hardcore Trekkie I didn't imagine myself saying this) one of my favorite Trek films overall. Lin somehow manages to blend elements of all 5 TV series into a modern sci-fi action film. It did not feel like the first two JJ films in any way. It felt natural, like you tuned into a modern technology based TOS episode peppered with the best elements of Gene's post TOS series' ideals. While the overall plot may seem like a simple tried and true movie formula, it's the nuances and character interactions that make this film seem more like the old Trek despite, strangely, there being more action than the other 2 reboots.This latest Trek installment should please Trekkies like myself, and fans of the modern JJ verse time-line alike.

I'm in no way a "Trekkie" (though I've recently gotten into watching repeats of Star Trek: Voyager on TV), I found the 2009 Star Trek reboot to be rather overrated (though I liked it slightly more upon rewatch) and, unlike most, I really enjoyed Into Darkness/found it to be the superior film of the two. No doubt I'll probably hold the "unpopular" opinion once again with this film, as I found Star Trek Beyond to be sadly lacking the 'oomph' of the previous film. J. J. Abrams may have his detractors, but at least I could follow the action in his movies. Justin Lin seems to favour chaotic camera movement and things being too dark to see. Yet despite the frenetic nature of his directing, it's probably not a good sign that I found myself yawning during the start of the movie. Nor did things get off to a promising start with Kirk confronting ridiculous CGI aliens that were obviously played for laughs, but failed in supplying any. I thought STID had a much more energetic and enthralling opening. Even in its 'slower' moments, I found that movie was much more engaging than this one which only really starts moving when the Enterprise is attacked (and even THEN, not quite enough to hold my interest). The "damn snow globe in space" is visually interesting, at least.Positives of the film? The cast make the movie watchable. In the plus column: Chris Pine playing the least jerky version of his Kirk so far and Zachary Quinto's Spock. Sadly, their friendship isn't focused upon as much as the last film, though what scenes they do share are decent. Meanwhile, Karl Urban's Bones gets more focus, and I think most will agree that's an asset to this film. He shares scenes with both Kirk and Spock, and their dynamics provide a lot of what's enjoyable in the movie. Tied with Bones for "MVP" of the film is Sofia Boutella's character, Jaylah. She certainly stood out to me the most in the film's first trailers, and despite being newly introduced, she pretty much steals the whole movie. Not only is she physically striking (Boutella rocks the black-and-white body paint/markings like nobody's business), but she's also a fierce lethal warrior woman who provides some of the film's best action as well as comedic moments. Before rolling your eyes at this description, just trust that she kicks arse, but actually looks *believable* doing so (unlike certain other crew members).Jaylah's first paired with Simon Pegg's Scotty, who she calls "Montgomery Scotty", then later teams up with "James T" (as she calls Kirk) and the rest of the crew. While some of the film's humour falls flat, her names for some crew members and not quite getting certain references are an example of the few genuinely amusing running gags throughout the movie that actually *work* (along with her liking "the beats and shouting" of Public Enemy/the "loud and distracting" Beastie Boys music). This is the first movie I've seen Boutella in, but already she's made a lasting impression on me. I enjoyed her fun banter with Scotty and her dynamics with the rest of the crew. She not only gives us what these movies have sadly been lacking thus far (a believable action heroine), but is also important to the story. She's crafty with traps/snares and holographic projections of herself, her character is given depth and a backstory that ensures you're invested in her survival. I'm pleased there are hints that she may well return (hopefully the promise of joining the "family" won't turn out as hollow as it was for poor Alice Eve's absent Carol Marcus, who doesn't even get a mention).The crew gets split up when the Enterprise, which just can't seem to catch a break, is destroyed (as it seems destined to be in every movie) and crash-lands on a planet thanks to Idris Elba's villain, Krall. While I'm sure many will disagree, I actually found Benedict Cumberbatch's villain in STID more captivating. While Krall certainly has an interesting look/voice (although, like with Simon Pegg's Scotty, his voice almost requires subtitles at times, as it's hard to make out what he's saying occasionally) and a somewhat surprising backstory, I can't say I was that invested. Nor was I overly fond of any of the alien characters (save for Jaylah), especially the double-crossing Kalara who kick-started this whole mess, thereby teaching Kirk a lesson in not believing every sad story one hears (at least he catches on eventually). Uhura hasn't much to do, though thankfully her boring relationship with Spock doesn't take up too much screen time, while Sulu and Chekov have their individual moments. Leonard Nimoy's Ambassador Spock plays an important part in the character journey of Quinto's Spock, and both he and Anton Yelchin receive dedications mid-credits. Silly things people were criticizing about the trailers, such as the use of Kirk on a motorbike and yet more Beastie Boys, are actually used surprisingly well in the movie (though some mightn't think so). I was one of the seemingly few who didn't take an instant dislike to the movie's trailers and was willing to wait and see how the film as a whole turned out before judging. Naturally, there will be those who will go into this movie ready to hate it and come out feeling the same way (as well as those who just won't bother to see it, despite criticizing it), then there'll be those not expecting much, who might wind up surprised and find they enjoyed it. Fans might appreciate some of the nods given here to past Trek. I myself had no preconceived notions going in, and whilst there were aspects/moments of the movie I quite enjoyed, on the whole I was somewhat bored...but hey, I think Into Darkness is the best of the three new Trek movies thus far...so what do I know, right? Hopefully, the next one will be better/I'll enjoy it more.

You know how people say 'this movie was soooooo... i had to register just to comment on it'? Well, i'm one of those people who immediately after that think 'i'm too lazy - i'll never do that'.Where even to begin??? (Some spoiler alert) From the main villain who is a bad version of Khan, to the crashing scene of the Enterprise - everything in this film is a bad rehash of what happened in the previous movies. Just with a lot more awfulness. Most of the lines fall flat(with a few exceptions not even worth a mention) in spite of the same quality acting. After all - the actors are not the ones to blame for the stupidity of the script. JJ Abrams just got tired - again - and it shows.And if you are not convinced yet let me ask you something. What are the most basic things fans expect from a sci-fi movie??? Tech and special effects, obviously. Well this movie has two scenes where they show some tech and only one memorable explosions. It wouldn't be so bad if the script wasn't held together by spit and duct tape. But it is.For all the ST fans - not worth the ticket. Just wait until the DVD/bluray is in the bargain bin. If it wasn't for the acting i would have given it a zer0. And for those who think it was good - YOU HAVE NO TASTE!!!!!!!

This is the new Trek movie I've been waiting for; one where I didn't just love the cast, but the actual movie (and also the cast). It even does a few things I thought were impossible, like making me leave with Kirk in the running for my favorite character. For the first time, including in the TV series, I really feel like we get to see the ballsy, tactical genius that warrants the legend Kirk is supposed to become, and I've gotta hand it to Chris Pine because this time around he knocks it out of the park, as does everyone else in the cast. Beyond is still very much an action movie first at its core, but it finally has the heart that the others lacked to make it really feel like a Trek film (funny how replacing someone who doesn't care about the series with Simon Pegg will do that). One of my problems with the previous movies is that I kept feeling like ridiculous things would happen for no reason other than JJ Abrams thought "wouldn't it be _awesome_ if...", without regard for whether it actually contributed to the story or, you know, made sense. I always left feeling like my intelligence had been insulted a bit (or more than a bit). This movie doesn't just avoid those ridiculous things, it does them, and then actually pays them off. Like, three or four times I started thinking to myself "oh movie, you were doing so well, but now you're trying too hard to be cool again, and it's totally not going to wo-- HOLY CRAP THAT WORKED AND MADE SENSE AND WAS Awesome". There are also little nods in memory of both Nimoy and Yelchin, and a couple of well-placed love letters to the franchise as a whole that... well, let's just say there was a lot of dust in the theater by the end. To sum up: Simon Pegg and company get it. The new Trek cast finally has a movie worthy of them, and it's about damn time.

Star Trek Beyond is the third instalment in the rebooted Star Trek film series. While not as enjoyable as the first film, I would say it's definitely as good as the second. Once again, it is a great modernised version of the classic Science Fiction series.After three years of their five year exploration mission, the crew of the USS Enterprise, led by Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), pull in for resupply at the star base Yorktown. While there, the crew encounter an alien named Kalara, who is the sole survivor of an attack by Krall (Idris Elba), a vicious alien warlord who wiped out her entire team searching for an ancient artefact. Kirk decides to dispatch with his fleet on the Enterprise to face Krall head-on and discover what he intends to with the artefact.Still retaining the charm of the original Star Trek series while also appealing to today's movie-goers, Star Trek Beyond is a solid, respectful entry into the franchise. My favourite parts in particular were the expanded characterisation and dialogue between Spock (Zachary Quinto) and McCoy (Karl Urban). Also, the action scenes were great, thanks in part to director Justin Lin, who directed some of the Fast & Furious films, and the special effects were very well done as well. This film also featured a nice tribute to both Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin, who tragically passed away recently. If you're a Star Trek fan, definitely check this one out.I rate it 8/10.

Took me 5 minutes to choose between 6 and 7.First of all: For me, who was very disappointed from the last part, it was a better movie. It also was a better Star Trek.The remaining question was...was it a GOOD Star Trek. Yo...Nes....in a way. The dialogs were a lot better and more fitting to the characters than in than in the last movie and for the first time felt like the where actually the characters and not just look like them. I very much assume that that this is thanks to Simon Peggs rewrites.So a lot I do think that a lot of credit that makes the film better than the previous movies goes to him, especially when it came to characters and dialogs.The characters: Kirk: Sorry Pine still doesn't fit the role. And that within the first 6 minutes of the movies he goes from being SOOO borrredd by everything to wanting to get rid of the Enterprise THIS IS KIRK.....who doesn't care enough about the Enterprise to stick around for the first 5 year voyage. And then only does because he assumes that it is more interesting than a space station? Spock: Quinto is a good Spock and a god actor. But he is at his best as far away from Uhura as possible. At this point we have had them fight about their relationship in 3/3 movies. I like his interaction with McCoy and heck even Kirk.McCoy: Urban is fantastic. He and Spock are the ones resembling their alter ego the most. He is just great and really one of the reason to make the movie watchable.Scotty: I really like Simon Pegg and like I said. I think his writing saves most of the movie. He is great characters but he is very different than the old Scotty. Now decide for yourself if that is a good or a bad thing.Uhura: The Girlfriend. I still think that the strong female character of my childhood is reduced pretty much to that. Yes she has some action scenes. But way too many that just have her and Spock argue. Just like him her characters gains a lot if she is on her own or with another Crewmember.Sulu: I still don't get the complains about his sexuality. It you are not bothered by it is a sweet short scene that could have been longer. I think his family could have gotten a bit more screen time. And for those Bigots bothered by it.....it's so short that you probably wouldn't have spotted it .Checkov: It sad that it's Yelchin's last appearance because he made pretty good with the Plot that he was given and had a lot Screen time that I had thought.The Story: I did have a Guardian of the Galaxy flashback a few times....which was good since it did save the movies from being as bad as the last. It also wasn't a remake which is a BIG plus for me. But it still didn't feel like the Star Trek of my youth.The Soundtrack.............no comment.The worst scenes: Scotty making almost the same jump as Brian in the last Fast and the Furious. And Kirk and the bike. Yes it was a nice action scene....but so little like Star Trek. Also Kirk not being the smartest person when it comes to planning but most of the time just being lucky.AND Kirk wanting to get rid of the Enterprise.All in all it was a good Science Fiction movie and finally a new Star Trek Remake movie that wasn't completely terrible.I would have given 7 to the SciFi movie...but the fact that it was supposed to be Star Trek made me choose the 6.

The latest installment of the franchise is packed with action and physical combat, and is an enjoyable enough adventure in itself, but breaks no new grounds in terms of sci-fi film- making nor advancing the Enterprise and it's crew in any longer term arc.The plot is kind of loopy and unconvincing, and one kinda of have to just ignore the weaknesses and just go with the action. The motivational element of the villain(s) is more of a 'really? That's it?" The Enterprise and its crew seems to have gone into 'unchartered' space rather carelessly and unprepared, and too easily overwhelmed. Also, Krall, the villain, could have simply threatened first to get the 'thingy' he wanted, and effectively demonstrated the efficacy of his threat, rather than go into the, "Who is he? Why is he doing all this massive destruction? What does he want?" Anyway . see it for the adventure, not the strategy and logic (despite Spock).Some plot devices are just overly retro and tacky in a bad way e.g. playing loud metal-rock music to blast the smithereens of the rival multitudes of space pods => really? Some parts can also be a tad too Indiana Jones.There are probably too many scenes on terra-firma (almost three quarter of the movie). Being a Star Trek movie, one would probably expect more intergalactic actions.There is a reasonably good attempt at humor and most are worthy of a smile, though the overall dialogue could do with more oomph and sufficient gravitas. Chris Pine's Captain Kirk somehow does not come across here as sufficiently Captain-ny, and he looks a little blotted and not quite in tip-top shape. I think Idris Elba would have been a much more effective menacing villain (he has the look and the talent to pull it off) if they had NOT alien- masked him. As it is, he is indistinguishable, and is just another space-age movie villain. The stand-out character would be Sofia Boutella's white-bodied Jaylah, who flowed into the character smoothly and would likely see her again in future installments. (Sofia also did an excellent job as the blade-legged lady in 'Kingsman The Secret Service') Sadly, this would be the last outing for Anton Yelchin as Chekov (though he has four other upcoming movies in the pipeline). Also included is a little tribute to the late Leonard Nimoy. As for the 'gay Sulu' thing - hardly noticeable nor matter - that little non-dialogue scene could just as easily be about his brother and niece. Enjoyable enough, nothing disappointing, but nothing to write home about either. Worth a watch!

Not a Star trek fan, I'm a sci-fi fan. There's a difference. Loved the first, disappointed with the second, then this. I don't know why early reviews are so positive, but anyway, it's my view. Been so long since a movie of this genre has been the complete package, story, acting, directing, CGI, etc. This movie does nothing to address that. I got bored 2/3 way in, wanting it to end. So many plot holes, just so many. Go see it, but don't have great expectations. It was nice to look at, but that's all. The bad guy started out being very good (at being bad I mean). Opening was OK, nice special effects, just no credibility. And way too much shaky camera, way to much.

I couldn't wait to see the film and i genuinely loved it. Epic music, great humour, interesting story. What more can you ask?There are some actor greats here, and quite a lot of surprises. You can feel Lin's touch, but he didn't overdo it. You can also see Peg's influence on the script, which, in my opinions, has been very positive.There are some emotional scenes, characters are coming into their own. There are some winks to fans of the series. I like both the series, old movies and rebooted movies and am looking forward to the new TV show. This movie is definitely the step in the right direction for the franchise.Plan to see this several time and am already looking forward to Star Trek 4.

After the two inaugural films of the now-called "Kelvin timeline" brought the stale "Star Trek" franchise back to life with a vengeance, this third episode slowly but surely sets the course towards calmer, safer waters.The subtitle "Beyond" is somewhat misleading because it promises some epic journey into unknown, something seen in "The Motion Picture", where the characters really had no idea what they were getting into and where some ambitious issues are raised. Here it's kind of like what the TV series used to be: The Enterprise floats around the space as it's its own playground and the crew gets into danger, alright, but you just know they will be fine by the end.The plot outline doesn't much differ from J.J.Abrams' entries, as it's basically another story of Federation cleaning up its own mess. The stakes are unbelievably high, again, in form of a villain bent on a wholesale destruction and the nearly indestructible super-weapon as a means to do it. However, the antagonist is disposed of in an almost cheesy, cowboy fashion by Capt.Kirk & Co. just the way typical villains-of-the-week were, in the old series. So I guess the "Star Trek" spirit is really back, for better or worse. Many of those who were unhappy with the "new" Star Trek will be much happier now, but I preferred the gloomy and costly resolutions of the first two films.The cast is now completely at ease with their roles, each one making their respective characters their own. Only Karl Urban as Bones seems to still be trying, unwisely, to emulate hammy mannerisms of his predecessor, DeForest Kelley. The director, Justin Lin, nearly matches his style to that of J.J.Abrams. He somewhat lacks elegance in camera angles and editing, but the pacing is adequate and set-pieces are really effective. Visuals are, in general, stunning and are probably the richest and the most detailed in the whole series.When it comes to verdict on "Beyond", it's a mixed bag for me. I admire the ambition and the impetus of the "new" Star Trek as much as I resent the cheese and safety of the "old" one. Some sort of convergence between the two seems to be in the making in the future and I'm afraid to glance "beyond" that point.

At first, I want to point out that I'm not a nostalgic, original-series-only fan. I'd call myself a casual but very keen fan of Star Trek, of what Star Trek really is or rather was.So that being said I have to be honest and say that I'm disappointed with Star Trek Beyond more or less. I'm not an enemy of the reboots in general and the first one called "Star Trek" from 2009 is one of my all-time favorite movies. I'm aware of the fact that a modern Star Trek in cinema-format has to change things to be successful and popular but in Star Trek Beyond I nearly had the feeling that it is just a generic Si-fi Blockbuster. When it comes to acting and action there are some great scenes but that doesn't compensate the kinda bad story and plot.This is just my opinion and I don't force anyone to dislike this movie. Maybe it's easier to like this film and the direction these reboots are going when you never saw other Star Trek stuff before. :/ I still have some hope for the new Star Trek TV-show to come up next year though.And most important: RIP Anton Yelchin aka Pavel Chekov

It's here, it's finally here. Star Trek Beyond is now in theaters, we can laugh and cry together my friends! LAUGH AND CRY! Why? Because Star Trek Beyond is great, perhaps even better than the first two movies.What I LikedFrom the beginning, Star Trek Beyond is a ride, it doesn't start with its usual action buuuuuuttttt it does have a bit of humor. One of my favorite parts of Star Trek Beyond was seeing other characters take on a larger role. Sulu, Uhura and Doctor Bones (my personal favorite!) all have their own part of the story. Their relationships change with the other characters and form something new and interesting. Bones has to deal with Spock, Sulu and Uhura have to work together. I loved seeing them play a bigger role :) The best thing about the Star Trek movie is the humor. It makes the movie so much better because they break intense action with a bit of comic relief. Bones is hilarious as usual with his negative attitude I love. You know a movie is good when it makes the movie theater burst into laughter for a few minutes than die down once the action begins. Star Trek Beyond was engrossing! Like I said in earlier reviews, Star Trek keeps upping the threat level of its bad guys. While this new one doesn't seem as threatening as Khan, he's still a pretty big problem. They have to put up a REAL fight to take this guy down and it costs them, tremendously. Rarely does it happen, but while watching Star Trek Beyond, I forgot I was watching a movie. It was weird, halfway through I blinked and realized I was in a movie theater. That's how swept away I was! The new character Jaylah is so cool, I like her a lot :) plus I ship her with a certain character *whistles innocently* THE FINAL BATTLE WAS SO EPIC, OH MY GOSH. I have to say it was one of the BEST battle scenes I have ever seen. Seriously, the music just killed it. The mood was so tense and it looked so beautiful, it was so well done. I'd love to see the movie again, not just for the humor, but for that battle. Honestly, it was amazing.What I Didn't Like There was only one problem I had with Star Trek Beyond, the villain... He was kind of hard to understand, sometimes I had NO idea what the heck he was saying. Not only that, but his motives seemed kind of random and out there. I'm not sure if that's just me, but I was a bit confused, it might have helped if I could understand him, it would have been nice if they had subtitles or made his voice clearer... Part of why his motives might have seemed weird to me might be because I couldn't understand him. Well, that's just another reason to see it again :DOverallI'm glad I saw Star Trek. It was constantly funny, had an amazing final battle and let some minor characters take on a bigger role. GO SEE IT!

I loved this film. It was everything a Star Trek film should be. It was funny, it was fast, it was thrilling, and it had a great message. In the first film I complained that the new crew was too animated. Kirk and company were like bunch of wild kids who had no idea what they were doing commanding a star ship. I complained that they made Spock too human in the sequel. In this movie, the crew finally found their stride. I finally felt like I was watching the crew that I knew...a well-oiled machine who had their priorities straight. True, this film was a bit formulaic. True the movie included story elements already explored in previous films. Still, it was a ride that I would take again and again.

The third installment of the rebooted series brings in the new director Justin Lin and sees the crew of the Starship Enterprise exhausted from over half of their five-year mission. The routine weighs on Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) as he reflects on another year past with his best friend Dr. Hank "Bones" McCoy (Karl Urban). The duration has frayed relationships between Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Lieutenant Uhura (Zoe Saldana). A stop at the magnificent spectacle space station Yorktown brings a new mission that has the crew of the Enterprise traveling beyond an unnavigable nebula. When the action starts rolling it never lets up. Lin is an expert at showing ships swooping and soaring at breakneck speeds. The close-quarters gunfights and hand-to-hand combat suffer a bit from the rapid, shaking camera movement but other times, he hits the sweet spot of sci-fi action. The crew is scattered across a planet and each separate pair takes on a mission from Uhura and Sulu (John Cho) held captive by the villainous Krall (Idris Elba) who has mysterious motivations. Simon Pegg pulls double duty as a co-writer and starring as Montgomery Scotty, adding welcome humor to the script.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com

Well, I love Star Trek. Watched 'em all, and I worked at Paramount Pictures in the Gene Roddenberry Bldg, and got to work with ST:TNG a few times. And I really love the Pine/Quinto/Urban (Cho/Soldana/Pegg..) & company's version, even though I think JJ Abrahms is all too often a derivative writer who re-writes (plagiarizes) too many prior films, yet directs very well. So I'm a fan. And right near the beginning, either the continuity dept./ the writer (Simon Pegg/D Jung/ etc.), or whomever buggered it for me when they showed Ambassador Spocks' birth/death date as "Stardate 2230.02 - 2263.04" (or something close to that), which means the older Spock was only 33 when he died. This obviously doesn't take into account his years from the future (And tells us how old Spock Jr. is at present). Seems to me in the future, they'd be smarter than that - perhaps by adding the time travel/ alternate time line date in the middle.I liked the humor in it, especially the horse excrement! and the tech was really good, along with set design, costumes, Acting (with this cast, Always excellent!). My criticisms duplicate what others have said, about the motivation of Idris Elba's character, for example. They should have gone WAY further with political relevance, like the way Gene & D.C. Fontana used to with TOS TV show, for example, the failing global economy; the bastardization of religion to cause terror (which has been rampant in recent years), or many other grand themes (yeah, I should have been a screenwriter..). The acting was excellent as always, and I saw a few new things now done before. However good the action was, there was too much of it. And the series has ALWAYS been about the characters and ideology. Let that mantra reign!! So even with my less-than-STELLAR critique, go see it. It's entertaining, and I guarantee it's worth watching. I'll see it again I'm sure!!

I'm a 39 year old die-hard Star Trek fan. I've seen every episode of every series. I loved The Motion Picture. I loved Final Frontier. Heck, I even loved Nemesis. Star Trek Beyond was a very good entry in the Star Trek film universe. I would compare it to Nemesis, in that it felt like something you'd get in the midst of a season of a Star Trek series rather than something written for the big screen. Don't get me wrong, the film was epic, but budget aside, the script was small-screen material.And that's not a bad thing! After all, Star Trek was made on the small screen. Star Trek Beyond almost felt like a love letter to the Original Series at times, filmed on rocky sets made of Styrofoam, and it just felt smaller than the other two films due to these B-movie sets, and smaller cast. But I loved that about this film. Star Trek is supposed to be filmed on Styrofoam sets and it added a certain charm to the film that the modernity of CGI cannot match. Speaking of CGI. There were some amazing action scenes, and the best one was bittersweet, during the scene where the Enterprise breaks apart. Wow. Beautiful, yet sad to see such marvelous technology get obliterated. I was also surprised by the fight choreography in this film, especially the fight scenes that involved Jaylah, an alien that joins Kirk and crew in the fight against Krall, a rather one-dimensional, but menacing villain portrayed very passionately by Idris Elba. This will surely rack up another Oscar for best make-up and possibly costume design. Oh my goodness, those uniforms looked amazing! Even the pajama shirts looked expensive!But back to the script, I give Simon Pegg credit. He's clearly a Star Trek fan and he knows the characters. The chemistry was there, just like the previous two films, and the acting was fantastic all around. Justin Lin did a fine job at establishing a good mix of campy and serious tones and isn't that what Star Trek was always about? Trek was always both fun and enlightening. I laughed a lot during this film, it was definitely lighter than Into Darkness, not as preachy, but it had 2 or 3 good philosophical scenes, albeit, no where near as deep or esoteric as many of the old Trek films and series.One thing that surprised me was just how shallow Spock was written. There was no emotional conflict that you get with Vulcans, and no battle between his logical reasoning and human side. In this movie he cries, laughs, and showed no hatred for emotion. But hey, it's a different Spock. I think Scotty was absolutely hilarious in this film, and Pegg had more scenes in this once, which makes sense, given that the script was written by Simon Pegg. I really felt that Spock took a back-seat in this one, but 2 particular scenes of his really got me teary-eyed even though they were not so much about him, but the "other Spock." But then again, this wasn't a character driven film. Kirk had a scene that mentioned him breaking out of his father's shadow, and there was some love dove stuff between Spock and Uhura, but overall, Star Trek Beyond was a very plot driven film, with an unique, innovative Villain named Krall, despite being a bit one-dimensional. Krall had some good philosophical lines and he reminded me of a psychic vampire. But there was no reason to hate this villain other than the sheer fact that he destroyed the Enterprise and many other Federation ships due to his vendetta against Star Fleet. The shocking twist at the end finally revealed why, and it was unexpected too, which made the villain a bit more sympathetic, but just a bit. Final rating is an 8 out of 10. Not as good as the the best Trek films, but better than some others and the quality acting, action, jokes, and philosophy will surely leave both the new and old Star Trek fans satisfied after leaving the theater.

I'm a Star Trek fan. To the extent I've watched all the original eps, all Voyager, all of New Generation, Enterprise... the movies... I'm not a purist. I like the franchise, but I don't care passionately about it at all. So you'd think I was the ideal target for this film. Where do I begin? Perhaps I made the mistake of seeing the 3-D version. It didn't work for me at all. What wasn't blurry was dark. If it moved, I lost it, and trust me, almost everything moved all the time. This was not a film for reflection or personal growth. It was high-octane action the whole time. The jokes were lame. Even without seeing it I bet you can guess: playful grumpiness between Spock and McCoy? Scotty complaining that he canna do something? Spock not getting some human feeling? Yup, all there. Nothing new here, folks, move along. Yes, these things are what make the series worth watching but they were tired, oh so tired and stale.I can't even go into all the daft plot holes... no, actually I will. So, they find a previous version of a Federation ship (about 100 years old?) crashed on a planet. It's all still working. On board, Kirk finds a motorcycle. Uh-huh. Within a blink of an eye he's on it and careering around a fearfully rocky terrain winning the day. Bloody hell, my bike doesn't start after a day in the cold let alone 100 years. In my world petrol evaporates. But I guess in the 24th century they've invented the other kind. Actually there are too many plot holes to bother writing about. The whole film was fantasy more than fiction. Star Trek was always so careful to keep its science credible and consistent. No longer it seems. Anything for a good plot device. Then there's the women... shall I get into this? Oh, go on, John, no one's reading you anyway. Thank God for tiny little blonde slips of girls, cus, ya know, they can kick ass. They'll save the day. Save Kirk, save the whole damn crew. In fact, I don't think the future needs men at all. It doesn't need men's strength, men's instinctive desire to explore and discover, men's way of viewing the world. This film has just told us so. Women rock. Women rule. Fine. I'll switch my allegiance to another franchise.

Star Trek certainly has come a long way since the 90s with the plethora of series, but then again it probably did need a bit of a break before hitting the big screens again. For those who have been watching the 'reboot' (for want of a better word since it actually came about because of some time traveling anomaly) you are probably aware that they are recast the Star Trek crew though we still have the characters from the original series. However, due to advances in film technology it is much more spectacular than even the series that arose during the 90s. The main characters have also been changed somewhat, particularly Captain Kirk, who is a lot more brash, and rebellious, than the original character. Still, it is Star Trek, and I have to admit that I was never a huge fan of the show in the first place.Anyway, Kirk is on the third year of a five year mission doing what they do best – exploring. Mind you, he seems to be going through some form of existentialist crisis, particular since the whole idea of exploring is no longer all that fascinating, especially since when everything you discover happens to be the same, so even if you are traveling in places where nobody has ever traveled before, if you aren't actually discovering anything, then are you actually exploring, or are you simply just making marks on a map.Kirk was attempting (rather unsuccessfully) to broker a peace treaty with some rather unusual aliens, and in his possession was an ancient weapon. Mind you, this weapon, as far as anybody was concerned, simply wasn't operating, so they catalogue it, and store it away for future reference. So, they arrive at this pretty impressive star base on the edge of Federation space for a bit of RnR. However an unidentified craft appears and inside is a refugee asking for help to rescue her crew who have crash landed on a planet in the middle of a nearby Nebula. However, when they arrive they discover that they are ambushed by a swarm of ships that are lying in wait.It is a pretty enjoyable film, and it certainly isn't anywhere as wishy-washy as the original series – there seems to be a lot more guts to it. Mind you, having Simon Pegg involved in the production does mean that it also tends to be somewhat funnier than the previous incarnations were, particularly the opening scene (which is all I'll say, however is typical of what one would expect from British comedy). As for the film, it is your typical science-fiction film, enjoyable if you like the genre, moreso if you are a fan of the Star Trek franchise.

I've never been a 'Trekkie' and have never actually seen any of the TV series or the original motion pictures, but as a sci-fi fanatic (though as one I probably really should've seen those by now, I know) I remember watching the 2009 reboot around its release with a few friends and loving every minute; the plot, the characters, the special effects... I'm not sure if I blinked once for those 2 hours. J.J Abrams' take on Gene Roddenberry's creation immediately made me a great fan of his work, leading me to see 2011's 'Super 8', his 2013 Star Trek sequel 'Into Darkness', and work my way through 121 episodes of 'Lost' for the first time. When I discovered Abrams wasn't directing 'Beyond' (no doubt due to his full focus on manning last years highly anticipated return to the Star Wars saga, and I'm sure we all understand how confusing it could've become working on a Star Wars and a Star Trek film at the same time) and noticed Justin Lin had taken his place, who I was already familiar with having watched him bring The Fast and the Furious series from two low budget street race flicks into a seemingly endless action-fueled blockbuster franchise that I can't decipher how I enjoy so much. I walked an hour to my nearest cinema to catch the midnight premiere in 3D (and later walked that same hour back and my feet are still feeling it) but ultimately, thankfully, and not expecting otherwise anyway, I was not disappointed by what awaited, and, arriving home after 3am, felt it was worth the exercise. I won't even hesitate before recommending seeing this film in 3D, because it offered plenty of scenes that worked beautifully in all their visual depth, including action sequences and extraordinary landscape shots that both had me grinning and wowing like I'd never seen a 3D movie before. The cinematography was amazing, though it was easy enough for me to tell Lin was applying his own techniques of filming here (which I respect, as some sequels I've seen have had directors clearly following by example of whoever directed their predecessor and not always producing a great result) and that Abrams was absent from the director's chair for this movie, losing his signature 'quick zoom' shots I'd noticed and found an effective touch in his two Star Trek films and in 'The Force Awakens', along with his incredible and admirable research of the original show and films prior to rebooting them. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and company deliver great performances as ever, and Idris Elba gives us an interestingly different role beneath some great prosthetic make up as main villain 'Krall', who, though thrilling in his own right, wasn't as chilling a villain to me as Benedict Cumberbatch's 'Khan' in the previous film. 'Beyond' I feel has the biggest emotional factor yet in the franchise, with less gags in place than the other two films, which, given in mind the loss this year of two great actors from the series, is understandably so, particularly in this being Anton Yelchin's final outing as Chekov, who, J.J. Abrams announced, out of respect isn't going to be recast for future installments. The pacing was fine for me throughout, and I was satisfied with everything that was fit into its two hour running time. On the whole I don't think 'Beyond' tops its predecessors but it was great fun to watch and filled with brilliantly executed action sequences and visuals. This is certainly a good and welcome addition to the franchise, and Justin Lin did a great job handling this sequel in Abrams' place, making this highly likely his best film to date. And it proves a touching tribute to the late Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin. I'm looking forward to the confirmed fourth movie already, though it definitely won't be the same without them.

A review of Startrek BeyondI had not been to the cinema for many years (36) and so finally the day came and I went. I chose Startrek Beyond which premiered in Dubai yesterday. I thought it would be a good movie to see with full effects and so we chose the IMAX version. In order to while away the time while watching the movie I composed a mini review in my head. Rather than letting it go to waste I am sharing it here for anybody who is thinking of going CERTIFICATION: PG15 I believe this means the movie was targeted at children under the age of 15 – and this was confirmed as the movie progressed. PLOT: Yes, it had one – one of the four that Hollywood uses for making movies. This was a great help as it made guessing what was going to happen next quite easy. ACTING: It also had some acting in it. The characters wearing the rubber masks were obviously limited to occasional eye movements (and also killing people) – sometimes they looked to the right and sometimes they looked to the left, and sometimes they looked at somebody. The characters not wearing rubber masks, only make-up, also restricted their acting to eye movements left, right, and sometimes they held a gaze 'meaningfully', which they will have learned in acting school. Dialogue was manageable in bursts of up to 7 words at a time, and followed conventional speech patterns ( Down at the end for a statement and up a bit for a question as in GPS systems) Of course they also killed people and jumped around the studio a bit. They had big plastic pop gun things which went bang bang and killed the baddies but didn't seem to work on the goodies. The continuity of Hollywood from 1890s wild west to future centuries is comforting. Also comforting is the fact there seemed to be oxygen absolutely everywhere on every planet and even in open space with no need at all for breathing apparatus. A tip to the director – seeing some of the actors explode through lack of pressure and die gasping of suffocation would have been satisfying to some audience members. HUMOUR: I believe there was also some of this. It was done in a Scottish accent so it was doubly hilarious. Although the 14 and 15 year olds would have been too sophisticated for it, some of the 9 and 10 year olds might have been amused. It was a hazard only to adults who had recently eaten. SUMMARY: Overall it was an enlightening experience. I gained deep insights into the nature of Time – no matter how many times you look at your watch the end of the movie won't come any quicker. My companion, who also had never been to the cinema, summed up nicely, and totally innocently, when he said, "I enjoyed the technology. We must go again but next time we'll see a good film."

The action scenes: 99% of the film and were mostly incomprehensible. I never knew where people were on the ship in various action scenes. It was all very disjointed... and stupidly (fast and furiously) unrealistic. Suspension of disbelief NOT engaged. Oh and the dreaded camera shake, the tool employed by directors to disguise badly choreographed action scenes... I'd take massive amounts of Abrams' lens flares over camera shake any day.The story: almost non-existent. It finally revealed itself near the end, but I found by then I didn't give a *expletive deleted*. Jumping from scene to scene, huge leaps, no transitions. No flow. Just yuck The weapon used to defeat the bad guy army: .....give me a break,PLEASE.The characters that we all know and love: empty, consisting only of their clichés and one-liners. During the very rare and random scene where character and emotion were attempted, I simply didn't care anymore (save for one near the beginning, and scene with a trio of characters at the end. ‪#‎llap‬) The laugh-track-esque laughter by about a fourth of he audience during the numerous one-liners: more proof that Idiocracy is becoming a reality.The best part of the movie: the two dedications in the credits. <3 Over all, an EXTREMELY disappointing film

From its beginning "Star Trek Beyond" shows us how good movies are made. In a genre that has been largely ignored by people who evaluate movies and decide what is an example of great cinema, this one propels itself to the top of the heap, science fiction or otherwise. "Beyond" has learned from the previous entries. It doesn't have a boring moment, and it is built on a solid and entertaining script. The film explores important themes and originates from the one line that we have associated with "Star Trek" for 50 years now... to go where no man has gone before.The crew of the enterprise finds itself exploring a call for help near one of the latest Federation outposts, a dazzling city in the sky which is going to set the bar high for this type of film. The first 20 minutes of the movie are beautifully shot, with a combination of CGI and art decoration that shows movies can still inspire wonder and awe. I didn't think it was possible to show the Enterprise in new perspectives, but all of its glory is just a prelude for the second act, where its destruction is shown in a grand and detailed scale. When Kirk's team encounters the new enemy, we are treated to a mind blowing display of artistry. It is inspired by other films, but the execution this time is truly masterful. The damage unleashed upon the Enterprise is savage and painful to watch.Once the crew is split and stranded in different parts of a pretty hostile but breathtaking environment, we get to follow three teams of crew members trying to survive and defeat this apparently invincible villain. We get to see "Scotty" meet an amazon type warrior who has somehow managed to escape from the planet's prison. Her ingenuity and fighting skills become crucial in future events in the movie. With the help of Scotty and the place she calls her "house", we know there might be a chance for all involved.Kirk and Chekov have their own problems to deal with, and they are a special target for Krall since they have managed to hide a particular important artifact. Their adventures are the start of an amazing display of stunt work and spellbinding editing that will keep the audience on their toes. Some people might think the physicality of the movie overtakes what have become trademarks with the series: their sense of clever humour and their visionary approach to technology and science. We don't go deep into new scientific explorations, but it goes into the use of resources both old and new. Here teamwork becomes key to what might be their eventual success.The third team is the cleverest pairing of Bones and Spock, a dynamic that has worked since the series first entered public consciousness. The chemistry between the two actors is excellent, and the lines are effectively used, giving the audience some of the best movie moments. There's plenty of positive and exciting energy going here, as Spock becomes pretty vulnerable and gets a chance to explore his human side.Eventually, most of the enterprise team gets to fight together, and the action moves on the big climatic scenes. These are very good and compliment the rest of the film. I hardly believe anyone will complain about the film being long, and there is an emotional response to the references made to Nimoy, both in and after the film, and the sense of loss with the fact that Chekov will be greatly missed.This film is one of the most exciting and pleasant surprises of the year, a sequel that actually works and honors the sources and films that have come before, that has grown both in its visuals, its effects, and its heart keeps beating as strongly now as it did when it first burst into our galaxy. Here is the swan that came from that ugly duckling that was that preview, one that scared me into thinking imagination had surrendered to mindless entertainment. "Beyond" proves that cinema can still produce a sense of wonder in all of us, and it gives us faith that it is practically impossible to change the theater experience. For a while, I kept thinking of those big visual spectacles that Hollywood has given us such as "Lawrence of Arabia", "Star Wars" and "Mad Max", making think that there is still hope to go where no man has gone before.

My review is short and simple. I am both a Star Trek and science fiction fan. I decided to go in on full free fall mode. Despite what the haters were saying; they themselves not even having watched the film yet. I stayed away from that poison. If you're a Trekkie or Trekker, you'll love it. If you're into fantasy, you'll love it. If you just appreciate a good movie, you'll love it. If you're one of those "fans" who are never satisfied with reboots in general and think that nothing could ever top your original love, then you'll definitely dig around for something trivial to make you bash it. A true fan who loves the concept, the science fiction of it all, the art, the futuristic sense, the imagination, the escape that Star Trek undoubtedly brings, then you'll appreciate the story. The actors deliver. The character development is on point. The music? Amazing. Go in and watch the movie and accept it for what it is. Don't look for something negative because if you go in with that mentality then you'll find find it. Haters gonna hate. Ainters gonna ain't. Go on. Be an "ainter". When you walk out of there realizing that for two hours you had escaped the harshness of the world, a world Gene Roddenberry was so against, you'll thank yourself for allowing it.

Add to the list of clichés destroying whichever Enterprise is the latest one. Each death of the ship is more realistic and detailed, and in this newest Enterprise we learn the the ship is made of about 1/2 escape pods.It's stuff like that and transporting people jumping off of flying motorcycles, and the slapstick humor that passes for a plot that forces me to give this movie a 4/10.It was watchable, but where the last movies were bright white on the deck the whole interior of this Enterprise was dark and gloomy.My problem, and it really is my problem because it is plain that someone is liking these new movies, is that I want my science fiction to be science fiction, and Star Trek and Star Wars are both really SF fantasy. There is no real element of science fiction except that these stories take place in space, which, believe it or not, is not really a prerequisite for science fiction.Science fiction should be about challenging the imagination and provoking new ideas, but Star Trek now leaves nothing to the imagination and makes it impossible to think.It is sad. I keep going to see these movies, but the ultimately disappoint me, thought the pace gets faster and faster and the effects do get better. It is just not what I am looking for in a Star Trek movie, nor what I think you should be looking for. I just don't mind me or you looking at a little eye candy now and then since there is such a small amount of real science fiction.

Great pick for both story and director. JJ entrusted the right person to keep the franchise moving along at warp speed and even the most fanatical Trekie will be hard put to find fault. Not only did they advance this story time line, but they stayed true to Gene's vision! The weave of old and new, scientific and pop culture, interpersonal relations and individual motivations are all of what made the original Star Trek grab the public's attention. Acting was spot on, everyone once again prove the profession by transporting the audience into that world. The tribute to both Leonard and Anton was appreciated and example of the class act from the franchise. Happy 50th Birthday Star Trek, Live Long and Prosper !!!

Star Trek Beyond (STB) (2016) was a respectable reuse of a successful formula that has served several past Star Trek films (and other Sci-Fi films). Propping up a simplistic plot by the overuse of eye candy (CFX,CGI), lots of nonstop action adventure, interesting banter between the main command crew, and tossing in a mean nasty cutout villain to justify turning out another money making movie. Technically there was nothing wrong with STB and it was enjoyable being new Trek but it does contain a lot of empty calories. It was a safe within the bounds ST movie that shouldn't tax anyone mentally. At the end of the movie some people near me said he felt he had just been on a long roller coaster ride. Another guy said to him but this was ST and it should be analyzed (jokingly?). The other guy said back to him no it doesn't. I just felt like I had sat through an upgraded two hour average ST episode that was not anything special to commit to memory. A big bad guy shows up with a big pointy stick is stopped by a hero.**Spoiler Alert**This is a more Trekish story plot I personally would have enjoyed. The one main thing I would have improved was the villain. Instead of making the villain a nasty mean immortal soul sucking ex-soldier seeking revenge for being put out to pasture by the Federation. I would have made him (and his crew) immortal and "enlightened" from being exposed to bits of technology discarded by ancient beings when their culture evolved "beyond". Instead of wanting to destroy the Federation the "villain" would bring the next best thing since sliced bread and canned beer to the Federation thus advancing mankind to new heights without all that tedious time consuming galactic exploration (shades of Borg and Q). The problem would begin when Bones and Spock point out the "evolved" humans have become static and over the hundred plus years and have not done anything useful (still stuck on the planet, no rebuilding, no clean up or dusting, no children, and no emotions) but only fixated on bringing their better future to the universe because they are so "with it". Kirk's suggestion to wait and study their "gift" to the universe is considered by the villain as fear of change by Neanderthals and the evolved humans start to force feed their gifts on the Federation which causes the conflicts. At the end the Federation mostly wins and the remaining evolved humans are whisked away by the original ancient beings to be cured or cared for until the universe is ready for them. As parting compensation the planet is terraformed (made safe for the kiddies) for the Federation so they can continue to explore that sector of the universe.

I'm not a Trekkie but a I loved Star Trek 1 and 2. Beyond is a nice and funny movie but not as good as the previous ones. In my opinion it has three problems 1. No time Action, action and more action... there just few quite scenes in the movie and less emotional parts. The movie doesn't take the time to explain something or to have breather. That's a pity. Spock and Kirk have an emotional crises but it's hard to understand them because you don't get the time for it.2. Villain Ridiculous villain. The motivation of the villain is really absurd. With some flashbacks and explanation he could have been great, but as mentioned before, the movie doesn't take time for emotional or explication stuff. It's hard to understand why the villain got evil and why he is doing this.3. Plot holes There are a lot of plot holes. Indeed, 1 and 2 had some too, but they were not so obvious.Conclusion: Beyond is neither a bad nor a really good movie. Switch off you brain, eat popcorn and have fun with it. It isn't really a Star Trek movie, but you can enjoy it of you like action movies.

What you are about to read contains spoilers, go back if you do not want to see them. What can I say? This movie was spectacular. From the beginning to the end, it captured what makes Trek truly special. Not only did the movie explore diplomacy and cultural relations with other species on other planets, but it also explored the future and the past of humanity, which is ultimately what Star Trek is about. Gene Roddenberry created a Wagon Train-style Space Cowboy series to hide the real intent of his masterpiece: exploring what it truly means to be human and what issues we face, whether they may be related to war or discrimination or whatever else. You want to know what really sealed the deal for me though? The accurate source material. By God, Simon Pegg and Doug Jung created the perfect screenplay that followed the source material of all of the series, but mainly Enterprise. Now, I may have some bias here considering that Enterprise is my favorite Trek series (because of the premise of the youth of human exploration) but it truly was amazing how accurate it was. They had accurate weapons (spatial torpedoes and pulse phase cannons), accurate clothing on the video footage, they showed a shuttle pod in the video footage from the show, the cargo looked the same, it was a WARP 3 SHIP which actually fit the era! The icing on the cake here besides the accurate sourcing was the legitimate villain. I thought throughout the whole movie that it was just some random alien dude and I was a little disappointed, but HE TURNED OUT TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF THE USS FRANKLIN!!! That twist was amazing and I must say that I did not see it coming. Great plot, great writing, accurate sourcing, and most of all...it actually FEELS LIKE STAR TREK!!! This movie is rate up there with First Contact for me. I can't wait to see what the frontier holds for the future of Trek, in the movies and on the small screen!

Let's get one thing clear: I'm a Trekie. I understand also, that a movie has somehow to appeal to a great amount of people in order to be financially interesting. Star Trek Beyond does it's job well. You don't have to use your brain. Indeed it's better to leave it at home when you go see that movie. But first things first, what was good about it: 1. Warp-Travelling: This movies shows takes, where the ship is seen really "bending space", which is the way warp-drives actually work. 2. The Space Station Yorktown: OMG! It's just so beautiful! A realistic view of what a space station could look like, considering the known technology of the star trek universe. BUT Star Trek Beyond has SO MANY PLOT HOLES and uses so many stereotypes, that it became impossible for me to give it a good rating.The bad guy: The troubled terrorist - for most of the movie it's not clear why he pursuits his goals. When it is explained, it does not make any sense. He possessesa great amount of advanced tech, which he could have used to get somehow happy. Instead he somehow need the space station in order to attack the rest of the federation. The "Better Ship": In a talk with an admiral, Kirk is informed that there is a better ship in the fleet as the Enterprise, but it's not finished. A good hint, that later on something bad will happen with the Enterprise, but they already organized replacement. When the replacement is really needed at the end of the movie, they just "build another ship". BUT EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE EARLY ENTERPRISE. No upgrades needed. The attack to Yorktown: Why they just don't send one ship to break throw the lines, use the bio-weapon and take the station over? Instead they send a overwelming power to the station. A overwelming power prone to loud music... OMG! What were they thinking, when they came out with this? The Gravity chaos on the station is just annoying. The Bio-Weapon behaves differently as firstly introduced. So many questions... It's no star trek any more. It's just another space movie, which does not care about accuracy. JJ Abrams just destroyed star trek.

Spoiler free review: I was lucky to go to the premiere in San Diego at comic con... the night was amazing but it ended with a super fun movie. That's the best word to describe it... fun.The difference with the past 2 Trek movies was that unlike the original films we didn't bond with this cast over 100 or 200 episodes of slower paced TV. These guys were just tossed into it. This movie gives us an idea what a show with them would be like. It's impossible of course to do. But it was such a nice break form the overreaching drama from Into Darkness. This is still serious and has tearful moments and sincere motivations from characters... but it's also fun. Some people forget the original trek as Justin Lin told the crowd at the premiere that the original series was fun. It was funny. It was a pure comedy at times. and he's right. This movie takes all the elements the series was... (serious, funny, action, fantasy) and mixes it into one giant movie. Including the Shatner like fist fight. Loved it.Dialogue from Simon Pegg and Doug Jung was absolutely natural to the characters and everyone had their moments. The scenes of different characters sharing moments with each other was great.New characters Jayla is terrific. Sofia was great in the part. It's sort of a typical Justin Lin movie too as in the set pieces, action scenes fx were simply amazing... breathless... the character moments fantastic, warm, sweet... the story was very good but some holes and confusion at times but it's so worth having that for the pure fun this is.

As one who loved the first two reboots under JJ Abrams, I was looking forward to Beyond in the hopes it would feature more discovery in uncharted space under the new director, but alas, it was more of the same as the first two films, only not as good. The dialogue was a step down, and as a whole, I was definitely disappointed.It's still Kirk, Spock, Bones, et alia and any Trek fan should see it, but I'm hoping for a more cerebral part IV, assuming there is one, and less frenetic filler. It's hard to elaborate more without SPOILERS, but I had to moan when there's a random motorcycle on the deck of a star ship, which is then incorporated into a rescue mission. It's about the pinnacle of contrivance.

I will admit I was a Trekker before it was cool. I watched TOS and fell in love with the show. Space exploration, a divergent crew and aliens! The fact that there was no war or famine; everyone got along without issues was just the gravy. If it weren't for TOS and Gene Roddenberry Sci Fi would not be where it is today. That being said I must admit to being a bit reluctant for a reboot. I have seen all things Trek, every movie and every series and am still in LOVE with the Trek universe. I love JJ Abrams but wasn't sure he could take on my sacred Trek. I was pleasantly surprised with the first movie.the cast was awesome, the second movie was OK but hated that it was a retelling but, this third installment has restored my faith.I am probably one of the very few people on the planet not to have seen any Fast and Furious movies so I had no problem with the directing choice. The fact that Simon Pegg co-wrote the screen play had me intrigued to say the least. The return of all of the cast was a great relief and Idris Elba is one of my favorite actors so I was set for a ride. And what a ride it is! The special effects are pretty mind blowing and the action fast and furious! Forgive the pun What was even better was the character interaction. There is action yes but, there is humor too. The Spock/McCoy dynamic is at its best so far in this film. Karl Urban and Zachary Quito OWN their roles in a way that hearkens back to the witty banter of TOS. Of course the rest of the cast is on point also and I have NO problem with a gay Sulu..sorry George Takei. Chris Pine is the ultimate action hero in this one and his Kirk just gets better with time. Anton Yelchin is so very good as Chekov..I was looking forward to more story lines for him. He will be greatly missed. I applaud the decision not to recast that role in the next feature. Zoe Saldana's Uhura is a bad ass and the addition of Jayhla played by the fabulous Sofia Boutella gives us some major kick ass girl power.I don't want to give away any spoilers..go see this one! You will be pleasantly surprised.I was!!!!!

By far the best Star Trek movie so far and the best movie of the summer. Better than Wrath of Khan or First Contact and definitely the best in the rebooted series. Not a boring minute in the entire movie, paced extremely well for sure. The starbase was absolutely amazing to see (your jaw will drop). The entire movie was just beautiful to look at. Tons of alien races to see as well as building on the interpersonal relationships of the crew. People are still complaining they want the old Star Trek back and this is as close as you can come. It deals with the crew as they are well into their mission to explore the vastness of space. The movies have to be more exciting than the T.V. episodes were or people would lose interest, and this movie absolutely delivers. I saw a few complaints about the movie being too dark or too much happening, making it hard to follow. I really only thought one scene was too dark to clearly see what was going on one. Great to see Anton Yelchin and so sad that he passed away before this latest installment was released. He did an amazing job as Chekov as well as most of the other roles he took on. They did such an amazing job with the casting choice for every character in the reboot. I read the next Trek movie already has the green light but they will not be recasting the role of Ckekov. I created an IMDb account just to be able to give my opinion on this great sci-fi movie. If you're a fan of science fiction, you should really enjoy this movie. If you're a fan of Star Trek, you need to go and see it on the big screen for sure. I will absolutely be seeing this movie in the theatre again!

Roger Ebert once said that the two items he expects the most from "Star Trek" are ideas and character development. I concur wholeheartedly. "Beyond" delivers enough of the latter item to elevate it well above the level of its two cinematic predecessors.Why use the word "elevate?" Well, I personally condemned the first two "AbramsVerse" films as un-Trek-like, addle-brained "Star Wars" rip-offs. But after having viewed "Beyond" earlier tonight, I can see that first-time Trek scribes Simon Pegg and Doug Jung have injected much more zing and humanity into the iconic characters we've grown to love over the past 50 years -- more zing and humanity than the first two films put together, I'd say.Amid "Beyond's" backdrop of phaser shoot-'em-ups, kickboxing-the- alien-bad-guy fights, starship holocausts and even motorcycle stunts (yes, MOTORCYCLE STUNTS in a Star Trek movie), we are treated to the more Earthly pleasures of the Kirk-Spock relationship. And McCoy's acerbic needling of Spock. And Kirk reflecting on how he lost his dad years ago. And Spock's reaction to the (off-screen) death of Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy) is quite touching, as played by Zachary Quinto.All the actors in this Trek fold, in fact, seem to have grown in their roles this time around. The chemistry between them flows freely and is even ticklish at times. The Pegg/Jung script certainly has a better handle on characterization that the Orci team did.Unfortunately, the film does not succeed on every level (for me). Once again, the overall plot borders on comic book-level dramatics, with an over-wallop of Star Wars-type explosions. And in the middle of all? A flat-footed. boring villain who is bent on getting an artifact in Kirk's possession so he can use it to kill many innocent Federation citizens. Why? Well ... because.The talented Idris Elba is stuck with the neanderthal-like role of Krall, a ruthless "alien" who craftily lures Kirk & Co. through a nebula into his home space. Once there, the Enterprise grapples with an immense army of "bees", which are thousands of one-man ships that end up pulverizing the Enterprise and capturing its crew, except for a few who end up on the planet below in escape pods (Kirk & Chekov, Spock & McCoy ... and Scotty).With the Enterprise literally being destroyed in the first 20 minutes, the movie then becomes a series of chases and fight scenes on Krall's planet, but those are still interspersed with some effective character moments involving Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Chekov and Scotty.So, anytime we see Krall or his storm troopers (my borrowed Dark Side word for his mindless henchmen) on screen, menacing or killing a poor hapless crewman or trying to do wrong, wrong, wrong things to Kirk and his mates, the movie becomes a generic actioner off the assembly line.By contrast, anytime we see Spock and McCoy trading barbs -- even bonding together when Spock thinks he might be dying -- the movie comes crackling to life. When we see Scotty forming a friendship with Jaylah, a native warrior-type girl on the planet, the film shows us how a Trek character can be a fun and entertaining counter-point to a simple-minded alien.That is why I found the opening minutes of the movie to be the most satisfying: Kirk is reciting his Captain's Log and during his voice-over, we see glimpses of these characters and the rest of the crew as the Captain describes how each of them is handling life in space. Soon after, we see Kirk and McCoy toasting a drink of whiskey (taken from Chekov's locker) celebrating James T.'s birthday.For me, it's a shame that Pegg and Jung (and director Justin Lin) didn't try to capitalize on more of the easy charm and heartwarming qualities that these characters can offer us. Instead, this film subjects us to more of the same sort of stuntmen-laden, CGI-drowned action that plagued the first two films ... that is NOT what Star Trek is all about.Ebert nailed it: Trek -- good Trek -- is ideas and character development. Obviously, these days, box office cash no longer comes from ideas, for sure. But character development? Absolutely. And this movie made more than a few baby steps in that very direction.Now if the next film can take giant strides in that same direction, we might have a pretty durn good Trek film -- for a change.

**NO SPOILERS** & in brief:THE GOOD Acting - as in the previous two films, good, even if sometimes imbalanced and under utilized in areas (but only when compared to the previous films). Bone's interactions and humour are the highlights,especially with Spock. Sofia Boutella as Jaylah excels in all of her scenes. Special effects - for the most part, very good, though it's occasionally clear that much of the budget was spent on the Enterprise compared to some other elements/scenes. 2 other points regarding the finale but cannot mention without spoilers.THE BAD Directing – Poor framing, shaky cam and lack of coordination diluted every non-FX action sequence. You either feel like a distant observer or a disorientated participant - never the middle ground, never completely immersed as is the skill of a successful director (I literally don't know what happened during one sequence). His Fast & Furious movies should be your warning – we're not watching car chases here. Predictable - whilst there was a good twist at the end that I didn't expect, it was lost among the rest of the predictable crap, be it physical actions or the script. The final sequence seemed to follow a step-by-step guide on it! Script - Nothing game changing or memorable like the destruction of Vulcan. Nothing as intense or as dark as the crushing of an Admirals skull. Just a generic villain with a stereotypical cause, no intelligence. Star Treks foundations are not followed in my opinion - no exploration of space, no moral dilemmas or thought provoking issues - just an above par action film designed to appeal to the masses. Plot holes – described in spoilers below.Extra Note The hyped up 'gay scene' that so many lost their mind over was nothing more than about 6 seconds of run time. Without all of the news articles, many wouldn't have even noticed. OverallIt's not a terrible film and is indeed worth watching in the cinema. But Beyond is a step backwards, and Justin Lin wasn't the right choice. A Star Trek audience deserves an intelligent script, not a headache inducing action film that's full of plot holes and Hollywood stereotypes._________________**SPOILERS** & in-depth: Acting: As I mentioned, the acting is good for the most part, but slightly out of balance - each character had their individual moments with one another, but this approach eradicated the 'teamwork' feel. Perhaps that was the intention. But the biggest character of the film - the Enterprise - is missing, and so what we spend most of our time watching is a peril absent adventure on a poorly portrayed planet against a generic villain. Star Trek made its name my pushing boundaries, is that beyond the scope now? Destruction of the Enterprise: The doom of the ship was brilliantly executed here - Kirk's reflection in the escape pod's window as he sees the remainder of his ship go down, the attack of the swarm, the situation of panic, the way the enemy board the ship, the weapons used, etc.  Music: The Beastie Boys song playing during the Franklins attack is superb! One of the few truly standout scenes. The special effects of the swarm approaching the star base is also a beautifully menacing image.Plot Holes/'questionable'; Defeating the swarm: Bombarding the radio frequency to disrupt communications between each ship is ridiculous. These are spacecraft, designed to operate in space. Planets, comets, stars, giant clouds of gas and dust (such as the nebulae supposedly nearby the planet) give off radio waves - are we to believe that these ships are shielded from all possible frequencies and intensities of radio waves that exist in the universe, other than their own operating frequency used for coordination? Forgetting all of the vague excuses possible for this, what made them all instantly explode?! All they did was collide with each other (which didn't see Bones and Spock instantly blow up after they commandeered one), whilst the beginning of the movie showed some being capable of penetrating the Enterprise hull. A pretty serious and incredibly convenient design flaw if you ask me. Besides, it appeared as though they all had pilots - even if the swarms communication was interrupted, can they not fly individually as when they left the planet, just without synchronicity? Scottys crash landing: We'll ignore that this cliff scene is a copy and paste from Justin Lin's last Fast & Furious film. But after this, Scotty's escape pod falls down an incredibly large cliff. The time frame presented should not have had him arriving so quickly, that cliff face was thousands of metres high! How did he get down? PHASE HIM ALREADY!!! Kirk, please. He's holding a deadly bio- weapon. Shoot this fool already! But no, we need more predictable drama. And oh look, FOUR levers you need to pull to save the day. I wonder which number will fail, since we need more predictable drama. The Franklin: Less than 10% impulse speed should be enough to reach escape velocity. Can it not gather speed within the atmosphere, without a gravity assist? Thrusters are shown to be saving the space craft from the (stereotypical) impact at the bottom of the cliff - if a gravity assist really was needed, why not just go up in the air first, before the 'drop'? Predictable drama? Also, did the bad guy and everyone on the planet not wonder where the Franklin could have disappeared to after it had been 'cloaked' by Jaylah?! Video: So, Uhura made the connection that the bad guy was the old captain by a split second glimpse of a grainy greenish video screen in passing (and why was it even playing)? The bad guy literally looked nothing like the old captain...

How is it possible to spend so much cash making a movie so utterly meaningless and bad? 185 million USD?This is 2 hours of your life that you will never get back.So, where to start? First off the story is so thin and seems like a child wrote it. It has no depth and right from the beginning you feel basically nothing for the bad guys or the good guys, and there are so many holes in the story.There happens to be a huge base far out in space where the Enterprise is going to restock? Isen't the Enterprise supposed to be out in deep space exploring?Next to this large space base there is a nebula and apparently a planet with perfect conditions for human survival. It seems to be right next to the large space base, which would seem very very unlikely considering the vastness of space. And the crew happen to land on the same small area of this huge planet so they can all meet up.Then they meet a character that seems to be a bad mix of Rey from Star Wars and Neytiri from Avatar who happen to have found an old federation ship (that of course they can get to work after 150 years on a deserted planet), very unoriginal.So the reason for the bad guy Krall to lure the Enterprise to his planet and destroy it seems to be a device that Kirk has that will help Krall kill people. But in the end of the movie it is very clear that using his ships alone he could have easily destroyed the base - so what was the purpose of this relic device in the first place?There is quite bad CGI during the whole movie. In every action packed scene especially the fighting the camera moves around so much it is hard to grasp what is happening. But even with this shaky camera trick it's impossible to miss how utterly bad these scenes are. The fighting scene between Manas and our Rey character is one of the worst Iv seen in a long time.The only thing decent with this movie are some of the actors and their dialog. Everything else, from story to script to CGI is just garbage.Im sorry I like Star Trek I really do, but this movie is not worth seeing in the cinema.

The third installment in the new Star Trek franchise brings back the crew of the Enterprise with a new mission towards another unknown nebula. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin reprise their respective roles. Where Into Darkness brought a more dark tone in comparison to the first movie, this one brings back the fun, action- packed tone of the first movie. The crew is given the task of rescuing the crew of an unknown person/alien/species. During that rescue they are swarmed by the enemy led by the new villain, Krall, performed by Idris Elba(surprisssseee!!!) and the Enterprise is torn into pieces , yes AGAIN. I loved the surprise reveal of Idris Elba because I was completely unaware of the casting. Krall seeks to take back an artifact aboard the Enterprise and use it to take revenge on the Federation. Justin Lin has already proved that he is a great action director with his Fast and Furious film and he proves it again. The set pieces are huge and when the explosions begin, no matter how much you want to critically analyze it you cannot deny having fun. Here comes the catch. Even though the Star Trek franchise doesn't have any element of magic, the characters have a sense of vulnerability and that kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what will happen next. As the set pieces and the action sequences are quite destructive in nature you do feel that THAT should have turned them to pulp BUT leave all practicality behind and you will have a hell lot of fun. We are introduced to Jaylah, performed by Sofia Boutella who allies with Kirk to help them rescue his crew and also exact revenge on Kraal in the process.Coming to the performances, the most standout performance was Jaylah. She kicks ass like a boss and it is fun to watch. Her fight with Manas played by Joe Taslim(Raid, FF6) is awesome. Even through the heavy makeup the emotional loss her character has suffered is visible. The most amazing thing about these Star Trek movies is that they heavily rely on the interpersonal relationships of the lead characters. Kirk and Spock, Spock and Bones, Spock and Uhura, Chekov and Sulu, Sulu and Kirk, Kirk and Scott, these relationships are the foundation of the movie. I felt like I know them from a long time and they have known each other for a long time. Even though it has been 3 movies, the time that has passed in the continuity of the movie is long, so the maturity of the characters is very necessary. It shouldn't feel like that after 3 movies they are getting to know each other again and again. Everyone knows everyone's characteristics and they know it so well that they know what any of them are going to do next. Elba's Krall is poorly written. He plays the clichéd villain who won't win and it is extremely predictable once you know what his plan is and by now you know that the Federation cannot be severely harmed. I hope they do some serious damage in the next installment. Leonard Nemoy has a nice sending off. Yelchin as Chekov will be severely missed and as Abrams has announced that Chekov won't be re- cast, Jayla seems to be the worthy successor to occupy the seat beside Sulu and take the Enterprise to uncharted territories. FINAL VERDICT: It is a very entertaining movie and will help keep the franchise alive. My rating for the movie is a solid 7/10. Keep in mind that this is ultimately a Hollywood movie instead of trying to make it more practical. Admit it that we do need to have some fun and yes, this is fun and a nice franchise for the new generation to follow

Star Trek Beyond has been released in India one week ahead of its release in the US and Europe, so I'm going to do all my friends there a big favor by reviewing.The biggest problem with this movie is that the villain is just not villainous enough. Even though he's Idris Alba, an actor of some note, he doesn't come across as a strong villain and it's not certain what he wants. Compare him to Benedict Cumberbatch in Star Trek Into The Darkness and you'll get what I mean. Chris Pine is aging at an alarming pace and I wonder how long he can keep it up. Karl Urban doesn't really deserve the screen time he gets in this movie. I enjoyed the movie more towards the end, once they've left the planet they're stuck in for a major part of the movie in and are airborne in space. The 3D effects are quite good.

**Captain, sensors detect an unusually large amount of spoilers ahead. Advise we raise shields and proceed with caution** First and foremost let me start by thanking Screen Writers Simon Pegg and Doug Jung for breathing much needed life and adventure back into this rebooted series that it much desperately needed.I love Trek. Period. Always have always will. Trekkie til I die. So once the announcement was made that they were going to reboot the series I was angry. Sure Star Trek Insurrection and Nemesis weren't our finest hours, but this was Star Trek, you don't reboot an almost 50 year old property like Star Trek.Fast forward to 2009 and the reboot (or NUtrek if you're nasty) and it was great. The idea of an alternate time line worked because they could create the 'new' universe they wanted while still letting the prime time line continue wherever it was.Warp to Star Trek into Darkness, the moment we realized as a collective nerd hive that this new franchise that had so much promise was dead in the water on only its 'second' time out. The idea that they would take an episode and 2 movies, chop them up mix it together with some over the top action and call it a 'New' Star Trek adventure was insulting not to mention damn lazy.So once the trailers for Star Trek Beyond came out the first thing that I thought was, "this looks like crap" plain and simple. After being burned with Into darkness I was ready to give up on NUtrek and wait for the new TV series next year.But being the Trekkie I am, I couldn't stay away for long. Plus I needed something to take my mind off the Ghostbusters reboot. So I put on my Starfleet uniform and went.I am SO GLAD I DID.THIS is what Star Trek is all about. The crew in deep uncharted space with only themselves and the Enterprise as they explore the beyond. The interactions between the various crew members were there just like I remember, the sense of family was there just like I remembered. THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT! It was over 2 hours but it did not feel that way as you are instantly drawn into a new yet extremely familiar world that you don't mind spending time in.Pegg is a fan (not to mention plays Scotty in the films) so HE would know what the series needs. I've never really understood it, studios want these mythologies and episodic based reboots of TV shows to succeed so what do they do? They bring in non-fans and expect something fans would want to watch. Where's the logic in that? Bringing a fan in to write is the smart way to go, It worked with The force Awakens and it sure as hell worked here. The ratio of humor to action was well balanced, there was not a boring moment to be had and many literal laugh out loud moments by everyone in the theater.There were a few things that I thought of as I watched and I'd like to point them out it I may 1-Spock and Bones. I cannot tell you how great it was to see them back up to their old back and forth with each other. Each time they came up on screen together I smiled.2-The Vice admiral job. They were going to let Kirk have it? The young and reckless one? You're telling me no one in Starfleet questioned this BEFORE he saved them all? 3-The youth/energy sucking thing. Krall crash landed on the planet, found this alien technology and thought 'If I hook someone up to the other end I bet I could suck their youth out'. Not my thing but hey, everyone needs a hobby I guess.4-Jaylah, she has been down there for who knows how long, escaped Kralls death camp, living on her own in fear, she just encounters Scotty and after a few words to him trusts him enough to take him into her secret 'house'? Much less didn't talk to Kirk or Chekov and instantly sets them free and lets them into her 'house' too? If she's that trusting, how did she survive on her own that long? 5-I have had to say goodbye to as many Enterprises as I have Doctor Whos. You have to hand it to the old girl, no matter what universe or time line she's in she will always go out fighting.6-The Star Trek universe really loves the Beastie Boys7-Bones and Spock crash on the planet, Spock is injured so Bones heats up this pointy piece of metal to cauterize the wound. Once he's done he pulls the point away and it's gone. Did he leave the super-hot metal point inside the wound? Why didn't he use the weapon to seal the wound and bypass the metal to begin with? 8-Gay Sulu. It's just a few seconds and quite honestly really didn't add or take away from anything so I say more power to them. Also, Sulu husband is played by the script co-writer Doug Jung.9-The Old Spock scenes were well done. Once Spock learned of it it was sad, but the end when we see the picture of the classic cast, there was not a dry eye in the theater. Well played Star Trek, well played.I could go on but I'm out of words for this review.Cliff notes version: GO SEE STAR TREK BEYOND! This is Star Trek at its best, a shutout out to the glory days we thought were past us. Beyond shows us that this Trek is new and different but just as familiar as it ever was and that is extremely comforting in this day and age.

This movie follows a generic story line .Movie is divided into three acts and after each act it gets better and betterAction is awesome,intense and fast paced with a lot of cool camera tricks .And the movie is very funny at times when needed.(Way funnier than the recent GHOSTBUSTERS)Villain was week in the start but it got better in the end.I would recommend to watch the movie in 2D because in 3D some the movie's action scene looked very dark and you can't figure out what was happening.In the end it's a great and fun time .

I thought this was a rather mediocre production all around. Too much emphasis on visuals and less focus on plot & character development.All the actors did a wonderful job. I especially enjoyed a more grown up Jim Kirk and I'm a big fan of Idris Elba, even though you don't get to see him much without his make-up & costume. Speaking of which: Kudos for the make-up; there are some really fabulous creations in this movie. Yorktown was visually stunning as well.Now to the not so good: Destroying the ship at the beginning of the movie felt like sucking the air right out of it. The story line was somewhat flat and lacked build-up, even logic. The directing was poor with regard to a lot of the special effect scenes. Fast & Furious came to mind. Fast, shaky and dark action shots fail to engage the viewer's eye long enough to make out and enjoy what you're seeing. Some of the scenes on the planet felt a bit like the old studio shot scenes with fake scenery... like Scotty picking up a clearly fake rock. I also noticed some inconsistencies throughout the story, incl. their outfits - how do they suddenly wear different items of clothing, while stranded on a planet?This may have been my local AMC theater but the sound was off a bit, too. Dialogue was in some parts not loud and clear enough to properly hear what they were saying.I'm predicting that die-hard Trekkies will be disappointed in this installment, maybe more so than I was.It's entertaining but a bit too shallow for my taste.

Better than the previous 2 much of which made no sense at all. Still cannot get my head round Fratboy Kirk, em-Spock and Simon Peggs much lauded but I am afraid for me crappy performance as Scotty. If you can get past the Vulcans letting an vastly over-emotional Spock represent their race at Starfleet and Kirks continual promotions despite continual cockups then maybe. Bones is the best thing in it and you can see DeForrest Kelley in there. It is still a bit wham bam crash bang wallop for me and loses a lot of the original series. Not quite the JJ Abrams plot holes the size of small galaxies in here which helps a bit. Reminds me of the TV series Gotham i.e rename it, rename the characters and maybe the reboot natural lazy writing will disappear .. so call it Star Battles and have capt Kerr, Mr Svarc etc and it could have been a CGI/SFX extravaganza to please the fans who dote on that.

In a swarm of hit and misses for the 2016 Summer blockbuster season, Star Trek Beyond quietly but surely surges to the top of what the season has to offer. Beyond, the 13th in the ever ageless franchise brings the reboot series another well oiled addition. Positives: DIRECTING - New comer to the franchise Justin Lin brings his Fast and Furious expertise and shows them off incredibly well. He hits the mark on most occasions, showcasing he understands the source material well without diverting it away from what made the franchise iconic. ACTING - All actors involved play their part with expert precision, what makes the film so much enjoyable is seeing supporting characters received increased screen time over previous installments. SCRIPT - Simon and Doug's script is well written and adds smart character humour that makes character banter all the more fun to watch. TECHNICAL FEATS - From the films perfect score to its dazzling special effects, the films Audio/Visual qualities are top notch. Negatives: STORYLINE - Whilst exciting 1st and 3rd acts are fun to behold it is quite pedestrian in its ambitions particularly the films 2nd act which slows the film down. The film does feel like a 2 hour TV film due to it's structure. PREDICTABILITY - There were times where it became easy to read where the film was heading and how problems were going to be resolved. Film Highlight - The Enterprises deterioration and Krull's entranceFilm Lowlight - Sluggish second actWhat could have made the film better - Krull makes an impressive entrance to the film and really brings an energetic kick to the scene playing around him. But with most villains in cinema these day (see a good chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe villains for reference) he is no Darth Vadar/ Voldemort/ The Joker. Which is a shame as he fits perfectly into the Star Trek canon of Villains. A little more fleshing out and he would stand out from the crowd contending to enter into the same league as the ones listed above. In Conclusion: With so many intended blockbuster failing to impress this season, the latest Star Trek films flies from the beyond bringing with it a much-needed-tent-pole-franchise-boost to your local cinema. It's a well executed film that will satisfy all that associate the Star Trek brand as high quality entertainment.

Movie was an entertaining romp and worth watching on the big screen. The CGI was simply incredible and it's amazing what they can do these days.That said, the plot was just meh and had several huge impossibilities or just dumb sci-fi moments. Reminded me of some old Trek movies. Some jokes were funny, some fell flat.The worst parts above all were too dark, very shaky camera scenes that left you asking, what just happened there? There's no way that someone could follow the details of some of the action scenes.All in all, I like the previous reboot movies much better, mainly due to plot. Time for another reboot?

High hopes for it despite the weakness of the current reboot being Chris Pine. Good script by Simon Pegg, paying homage to the original series and a good set of one liners, mostly delivered by Simon Pegg / Scotty. The problem is that reliance on special effects and a continuous roller coaster making some sections difficult makes it a reasonable film, rather than the previous outing with Benedict Cumberbatch as the baddie. If you are a fan of the original (5) series there are many serious plot holes including a complete disbelief of some of the technology & sets. Please keep Vulcans as the unemotional beings, rather than ones with a crush on.... I saw it immediately after Big Friendly Giant, again reliant on CGI but with an excellent script, great characterisation and special effects that made it a delight to watch, not a roller coaster.

Wow, this is the best action film I have seen this year but that is not to say that it is all action as thankfully it isn't there are many tender and emotional scenes. This is the best film in the new rebooted Star Trek universe with the crew now more of a family and this love and respect for each other shines through. It is quite sad when you realise that this is the last time this family is complete with the tragic loss of Anton Yelchin. The cast are fabulous and they are all given something productive to do to keep the plot moving. The villains of the piece are truly villainous, the action sequences are full-on but not overdone or too long. My only problem with the film is that the identity of bad guy was telegraphed too early but all in all it is a terrific film.

From Paramount Pictures and Bad Robot, Producer J.J. Abrams once again returns audiences to the world of Captain Kirk aboard the U.S.S. Starship Enterprise (NCC-1701) in a film that encompasses much of what was loved about the original series/movies, and combines that soul with the film production technology of today. Despite the subdued anthropological subtext, which is one of the primary differences between the Star Trek and Star Wars universes respectively, this story will definitely keep you entertained with brilliant writing and a nostalgic feel. For long-time fans of the franchise that's been around since the 1960s, you will find that Abrams handles the settings and characters with care and respect. The third film in this reboot series, Star Trek: Beyond is one roller coaster of a ride that boasts a narrative pace that moves at warp speed. If there is one fallacy in the storytelling of this installment, in the Abrams reboot of the Gene Roddenberry classic, it is the lack of social commentary on the human condition that has been at the core of Star Trek since its creation. With a fantastic cast, incredibly strategic direction, and beautiful cinematography and visual effects, Star Trek: Beyond will whisk the audience away to the final frontier and "boldly go where no one has gone before."As a long-time Star Trek fan myself (TNG & Voyager), one of the very first elements I picked up on at the beginning of this installment was the trademark bridge sound effects from the original Star Trek TV series. Employing a little suspension of disbelief, what with all the flat panels and touch screen displays and all, the bridge of the NCC-1701 Enterprise still boasts the old soul of the bridge that started a universe of adventures that continue to this day. Fortunately, visionary producer J.J. Abrams, director Justin Lin, and writers Simon Pegg & Doug Jung craft a story that mostly takes what made the franchise so endearing and channel it into an exciting story for audiences today. From the characters to the dialog, and from the interpersonal interactions to the settings, this Star Trek movie effectively leads the reboot of the franchise in the right direction. Having just watched Abrams' Star Wars: the Force Awakens back in December, I was very curious as to how similar Beyond would look and feel as compared to the aforementioned. Forced to decline the director's chair for Star Trek: Beyond, Abrams turned the reigns over to Lin while still serving as the creative producer. Directing Star Wars and producing Star Trek could have left audiences with similar cinematic experiences; however, both movies are vastly different but provide fans with excellent additions to the respective universes.Prior to screening the movie, I was very skeptical going into it since the various trailers for the film were disappointing–looked like the film was going to be cheesy. To my surprise, the film was definitely not hokey and played out exceptionally well. Compared to the previous two films, I definitely like this one much more. That is mostly attributed to the fact that Beyond felt like a Star Trek movie. The previous two installments felt like a Star Trek movie taking place inside a Star Wars-esque universe. Hopefully, this film will redirect the reboot of the motion pictures in a direction more closely aligned with the original series and movies. With Star Wars and Star Trek trying to find their respective places in today's culture of media, entertainment, and gaming, it is important for both series to be distinctly different from one another. Now, I don't mean different stories or characters–obviously, that's a given by default–but I mean the feel of the stories needs to be unique. Star Wars is an action-adventure mostly concerned with good v evil and Star Trek is science-fiction that concerns itself, traditionally anyway, with the human condition. Both take place in the future, but are different experiences. There is demonstrable evidence in Star Trek: Beyond that the franchise is seeking to stay true to its roots in anthropology and psychology; whereas Star Wars: the Force Awakens is staying true to its roots in futuristic good v evil in a galaxy far, far away.From a technical perspective, the film is flawless; however, it would have been nice to have seen more practical effects and miniatures more so than digital effects, albeit, the effects were impressive. I appreciated the focus on the interpersonal relationships between the characters, and how it upstaged the actual conflict. Yes, the conflict in the story is important and is what drives the action, but it's the characters themselves that are the most important element in the narrative. Does this film shift the dominant focus off Star Wars and onto Star Trek? Not particularly. But does this movie pave the way for the Star Trek movies to be on par with the Star Wars movies? I believe that we could begin to witness that trend. Star Wars has the massive advantage of being owned by the Walt Disney Company; and therefore, TWDC is integrating that IP into the parks, cruise line, and merchandise. That is HUGE. Unfortunately, Star Trek does not benefit from being owned by a distribution company and legacy studio with theme park investments in the United States, anyway. Paramount did have amusement park investments, but sold them off to Cedar Fair many years ago. Perhaps the interest in the Star Trek movies and upcoming TV series in 2017 will generate a desire for this IP to become part of a themed entertainment property as well.Whether you are a fan of the original series or movies OR you are a new fan to the Star Trek universe, I feel confident that you will find much to enjoy in this newest installment in the Abrams reboot. Hopefully the film will perform well over the weekend and begin to generate an interest in the upcoming TV series as well.

Based on the first trailer that came out, I expected this movie to be like fury road. Boy was I wrong (the motorcycle was barely in it).Anyway, I REALLY enjoyed the first movie, and this one was almost as good. It didn't drag, didn't bore me, didn't set off my "that is stupid" alarms, and had a pretty cool plot line.No point in giving a lot of information, I'll just say if you enjoyed the other new Star Trek movies, you will enjoy this one.If you get all whiny about lens flares or some shaky cam in some heavy action scenes, you may have some beefs. If you can't follow half a dozen story lines, well, Star Trek probably isn't for you. But it was great, and I'll be buying it on blu-ray as soon as I can.

A surprise attack in outer space forces the Enterprise to crash-land on a mysterious world.The assault comes from Krall, a lizard-like dictator who derives his energy by sucking the life out of his victims.Krall needs an ancient and valuable artefact that's aboard the badly damaged star-ship.Left stranded in a rugged wilderness, Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew must now battle a deadly alien race while trying to find a way off their hostile planet.....I get what Pegg was trying to do when writing this Star Trek film, he was trying to emulate the feel of the TOS, but keeping in mind the freshness of the reboot by keeping the humour as light as can be.Well I saw Galaxy Quest too, and this is pretty much what the film feels like throughout, a familiar yet bland experience that has two very good set pieces, but little else in the vein of entertainment.It's the very opening scene that will sell you on how you are going to react to the film, but this opening scene to me made Kirk look like an absolute moron, and for me, it stayed with him for the whole film, despite him trying his best Willis smirk every time a plan comes together.Urban is easily the best thing in the film, and his scenes with Spock are the most touching thing in the film. If the narrative was focused more on these two, the film wouldn't have felt so 'sarcastic'.Pegg is watchable, but by the twentieth time he's called Jaylah 'Lassie' you just want to throttle him.Elba is wonderful as the antagonist, but I feel that there is some missing footage from somewhere, because Uhuru spots him so easily in found footage, and his character could have been fleshed out more, rather than having him turn into Basil Exposition toward the end.But the biggest problem with the film, what really took me out of the action is when they jump the shark with the inexplicably silly way of fighting the villains. instead of being exciting and fist pumpingly tense, it's toe curlingly awful, and ruins the film.And a word of advice, don't see it in 3D, it adds nothing to the film apart from making the film almost too dark to see.So aside from a couple of decent set pieces, it's a bloated, almost self-deprecating parody of what was a great reboot.It's almost as bad as The Final Frontier.

While I have been a huge Star Trek fan my entire life, I have to say this film was less than thrilling and suspenseful. I was quite bored throughout. The horrible CGI in the opening scene was so ridiculous it felt as though I was watching a B movie on the Sci Fi channel. One of the things people have loved about Star Trek for decades, is that everything they talked about was achievable through peace, cooperation and unity, ultimately leaving the galaxy a slightly safer and more reasonable place. However, this nonsense that J.J. Abrams/Paramount has been spitting out since 2009 is nothing short of a Kill Bill movie. These remakes are nowhere near anything Gene Roddenberry had in mind when he created Star Trek 50yrs ago. The whole point of the show was for peace and harmony. Yes there was fighting and destruction in all the Star Trek series' but nothing compared to the disgusting, senseless and never ending portrayal of violence in these. I doubt Gene would approve.

I've been really loving the rebooted Star Trek series. 2009's Star Trek is one of my favourite sci-fi movies of all time, and Into Darkness is a very solid sequel. However, I'm disappointed to say that Star Trek Beyond doesn't quite live up to its two predecessors. Whilst there's still some good popcorn fun to be had, along with a brilliant range of top-quality performances, Beyond feels too generic and messy to be a truly exhilarating and enthralling watch.The film's not bad, it's just missing out on so much that made the first in particular so good. Above all, it seems like Beyond is really going for style over substance. The first movie was an incredible display in mixing fascinating character insight with blockbuster thrills, whilst Into Darkness kept that going with some brilliantly tense and emotional sequences centring around the leads and villains.In Beyond, the good vibes between all of the crew members aboard the Enterprise mean it's a somewhat stale affair. Given that everyone on board is getting on famously with one another, there's nothing particularly personal at stake, leaving only the generic 'fate of the universe' as the threat that the Enterprise has to face.The film starts off on an okay footing, but it was immediately clear to me that there was going to be more focus on big action than great character focus. In the end, what disappointed me most about Beyond was the fact it failed to rectify a very thin opening act as the film went on, and I never felt any truly convincing motives for any of the characters, which was a real shame to see.Another issue that I have with the film comes from its visuals. Despite being a masterpiece of CGI, just like the previous two have been, Justin Lin's directing style just doesn't suit the Star Trek series. Whilst J.J. Abrams gave the action scenes an exhilarating appearance, Lin's tendency to overuse shaky cam amidst a sea of CGI made every action scene feel messy and misguided, and definitely not exciting or entertaining enough to make up for the losses in character depth.From the above criticisms, it would seem that I didn't like Star Trek Beyond at all, but that's not true. For one, it is still an entertaining watch, and the bulk of the film, which is set on an alien planet in which the crew spend a lot of time exploring (in a very similar fashion to the original TV show), is a lot of fun. The introduction of Jaylah, a badass alien warrior, gave that part of the film a good burst of energy, and it really helped me to have a lot of fun despite the disappointingly predictable and generic plot.What's more is that the performances are once again excellent. Chris Pine continues to shine as Captain Kirk, and the supporting cast are all just as impressive and entertaining as the past two movies. I did feel that Beyond lacked the comic relief that Star Trek in particular was so good at, but the range of performances was good enough for me to see past that.Overall, I was disappointed to see that Star Trek Beyond fell foul to a more generic, blockbuster vibe. Losing the personal drama of the first two, and suffering in its action scenes as a result, it's rarely an exciting watch. However, its sense of discovery in its main act, along with a heap of great performances, make it a solid and fun watch in the end.

Fantastic movie!10/10 for Star Trek, 9.5/10 for Star Trek Into Darkness, and this one is just as great as those two.I'm not a Treky or familiar with the Star Trek world, i've only watched the series that William Shatner was in back in the day but these 3 films have hooked me in, and i will look forward to future instalments in this series.These 3 films have all been exciting, funny, dramatic and the action has been top class! And in this one it was just jaw- dropping for me! Justin Lin has done an amazing job of an entertaining script by Simon Pegg, Doug Jung and the other 4 writers.I think people that haven't seen the previous 2 films will be perfectly fine watching this as a stand-alone film because it works really well on its own.I wouldn't be surprised if Justin Lin, or Simon Pegg and Doug Jung get a call for a future Star Wars episode after this. They've done a fantastic job here!10/10

Fifty years ago, through their home televisions, the world was introduced to a new way to explore new frontiers. Extraterrestrial worlds could be explored and made peace with from the comfort of the living room, later spawning a long series of theatrical releases that still won't quit. So now, Fast & Furious director Justin Lin takes the responsibility of creating the first Star Trek feature shot entirely on digital cameras, in an effort to balance out the uniqueness of the franchise along with Paramount's populist style of entertainment. The anticipation may sound hopeful, but Star Trek Beyond fails to stand out as its own entity, instead becoming exactly what Star Trek into Darkness turned into, minus the unnecessary underwear shot of Alice Eve.I was never a fan of Star Trek; the original series always came off as boring to me, and the movies have been just plain predictable and unexciting. So how did this film appeal to me as an outsider of the franchise?Right from the first scene I knew I was in for something I was not going to like; basically Kirk gives a message of goodwill to a council of aliens, offering them a symbol of peace. I felt some disaster coming when I saw the embarrassingly bad composition of the CGI aliens, made all the more painful to watch during their attack on Kirk in response to his offer. Kirk then explains in voice-over about how he can't feel at home midway through this five-year mission, an important character trait that has little resolution by the film's end. The USS Enterprise then arrives on this mystical high-tech planet coated in glass, where Spock hears some untimely news about his peoples' ambassador. An unidentified vessel soon arrives, where an alien mistress calls to them for help. At this point, I've seen this whole routine happen before in better movies.As the USS Enterprise flies toward the alien's rescue mission, a swarm of enemy ships attacks. Now, this part here could have blown my mind with its spectacle, except it didn't for some reason. The ships hijack the Enterprise, and their leader marches onto the ship in precisely the same fashion as Darth Vader in the beginning of A New Hope. He takes the crew members captive, and the Enterprise breaks apart, crashing onto the destination planet with a devastating catastrophic burn. Nope, still don't care.I think that the excitement could have been better if the screenwriters took more care to add tension and conflict within the scenes that exist only to explain important plot details. But the actors weren't doing much to flavor up the dialog either. Zachary Quinto as Spock was the only actor I enjoyed, as his straight emotional expression actually made his lines of comic relief all the more effective. Now don't get me wrong, I see potential in the story, but the drama should have been more intensified to heighten the action.The characters also had plenty of potential to generate much more staying power than the end result. Clear backstories are given to each of them, but the countless subplots add to the confusion of remembering all the details. It's the same problem Independence Day: Resurgence had, except with a more committed cast. While I'm not against the idea of multiple subplots, it still takes a lot more effort from the writers to achieve this complex format. Of all the old and new characters that Star Trek Beyond crams together, the only character that I wanted to learn more about was the white alien girl Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), who I honestly would have wanted to see as the main character of this feature.Now look, I certainly did not enjoy this film as you probably did, but I would not say that it was a total loss. While I would complain that there's too much CGI, cheap-looking makeup effects, and a lack of exploration of new worlds, there's still plenty of neat sound effects and enormous size to add enough fun for your Trekkie senses. Again, it's the type of movie you have to have the proper taste for, but if it aligns with your taste, and you're willing to shut off your disbelief enough for the reasons I stated above, then you shall live long and prosper with this exhilarating journey.

This might be an OK movie. I couldn't really tell with the very murky 3D. I was unfortunate enough to see it in this format against my usual preference. When will they stop? No one can possibly like this format. Just stop itThe 3D effects were worthless. The shaky, zooming camera made action in comprehensibleThis also seems to be turning into a soap opera like other long running series with multiple characters (fast and furious) I don't want to knock the film too much S I was too exasperated and alienated by the poor visual quality

Star Trek BeyondContains SpoilersThis year marks the 50th anniversary for this sci-fi series franchise. This is also the third film in the rebooted or alternative universe of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the crew of the USS Enterprise.There had been a lot of rumours about this film and given the anniversary, many wondered just how it might show the Star Trek universe at its best. As with all reviews, I won't give the plot as I hate spoiling things for others. So, what one word would I give this movie after seeing it? Brilliant.It is the best of the three by far, this adventure for me, goes beyond everything. There has been a subtle move away long title introductions to grab the viewers and hold them like hell for the ride. Star Trek Beyond mixes humour, action, adventure, edge of the seat drama along with character development while not forgetting to carry the audience. It is very hard not give away anything here. So sort of spoiler alert. The actors certainly appear to fit 'their' version of the roles in this movie, which is sad for one given the well-publicised news of Anton Yelchin's death. There was all sorts of 'drama' over what was a minor element of the whole movie, that of Sulu's partner. It just flashed by, so ? The plot was good - yes there might be holes as I have said a number of times before what film has none - very few. It is well put together for my liking it flows, no stopping, just action. One bit I really like was the Enterprise travelling through wrap, that was rather good. There are a number of things in the movie which pays tribute to the original actors and the 50 years that has past. You do have to listen to some lines very well in order to get the in-jokes. Again some sadly delivered by Chekov. The sadly bit is that we won't hear those again.The underlying theme of this movie was unity is strength and to be honest, has always been a central element of Star Trek. Together no matter what, we are stronger. Kirk and Spock realise their true friendship which again, should be clue to people in the real world. It takes McCoy to 'link' them together pointing out what they both miss. Highlights: Very difficult to say anything here without giving the game away. There is one scene which for a Star Trek fan is brilliant and you won't miss it I am sure. I will be seeing the film again, I almost walked out of one screening and into another, I don't do that for many films at all. Simon Pegg did a very good job on this film as both Scotty and one of the main writers. I would hope he has a hand in the next script. Star Trek Beyond runs for 120 minutes, full colour, 3D and 2D, full of sounds and is good.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2660888/fullcredits/Tagline: "To boldly go where no-one has gone before"

WARNING: Possible, minor SpoilersThere is probably nothing I could write about this film that hasn't already been written. So I'll just dispense with writing a full review and give you the cliff notes on what works and what doesn't in this film: Pros -Continued great performances from a great cast -More screen time for supporting characters in said cast -Great buddy duo in Spock and Dr. McCoy -Touching tributes to the late Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin. -Starbase Yorktown is the coolest space station since the Death Star -Climactic action scene -Funny opening scene -Sofia Boutella's character -A story structured like an episode of the original seriesCons (Khans?) -A story structured like an episode of the original series. Yes, this new film is Star Trekkier than the last two films, but it also feels smaller -4th Star Trek film in a row with a villain who wants revenge against the Federation for muddled, somewhat incomprehensible reasons -Idris Elba's villain character isn't fleshed out enough -McGuffin -Action scenes are muddled and difficult to follow. They are shot with a lot of hand-held, shaky camera-work, dimly lit, and quickly edited. -Lacks Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek, i.e. No more philosophical or political or scientific than the last two films. -The early scene where the enterprise is destroyed goes on for far, far too long.Well, that's what I thought, anyways. See it, it's good enough that your time will not go wasted. Or, don't see it, it's mediocre enough to pass on. 2.5 (out of 4)

Let me start by saying that I hate the Abramsverse with all my heart. He took a cerebral, philosophical series and turned into an action franchise. Moreover, ST Beyond is just another take of Into Darkness (without Cumberbatch). Yet I liked it. I was entertained by it.That doesn't mean that I didn't feel that it was less Star Trek than it should have been, but I certainly disagree with people that said that they had the script and they just plastered it over Star Trek. It was the exact same recipe: frustrated angry villain hating the Federation, Enterprise saucer plowing through the earth, jumping around, explosions, heroic sacrifices. Yet it was better held together than Into Darkness.I was kept at the edge of the seat. That is good for a movie, but not a very Star Trek thing. The occasional lapses in logic or explosions of good luck also didn't help it. Yet this is what the audience wants, apparently, even if the cinema hall was almost empty and look here: only 60 reviews. Let us remember that the trend started with a rehash of a very beloved Star Trek film. It was so successful because it was emotional and edge of the seat.Bottom line: J.J. Abrams rebooted Star Trek by erasing Jean Luc Picard and Benjamin Sisko from existence. For him, the only Star Trek captains worth keeping was cowboy James T. Kirk and some memories of Archer, whatever he was. For better or for worse, or until Panasonic sells the rights to Marvel or whatever, we are stuck with this. Given the circumstances, this was a better movie than I had anticipated.

When I first found out that Justin Lin was directing the next Star Trek I was very nervous; I was never a huge fan of F&F.Choosing a franchise like Star Trek, with a very dedicated fan base was dangerous. I watched the series when I was growing up.What Lin does with Star Trek is actually quite refreshing. I think die hard Trek fans might find it a little too mainstream, but I think Star Trek needed to break into new markets, gain new audiences and this film certainly does that. I've read a few negative reviews on here asking for the old Star Trek...it's disappointing that for something so ahead of it's time some people prefer to be stuck in the past. This is EXACTLY what the franchise needed and will definitely attract more movie goers to future Star Trek films!With any space film CGI is usually impressive; with Beyond it's beautiful. Seeing it in IMAX brought all the colours to life. Everything flowed well and particularly during the first 20 minutes I was in awe.I like how the focus has moved from Kirk and Spock. There's a lot more of the other crew members in this film which was needed after the first two. I really John Cho and the late Anton Yelchin. On that, it'll be interesting to see what they do with Chekov, I don't think Anton will be replaced easily.Idris Elba is a good cast, although Krall isn't a memorable villain. His back story could have really been built on more but overall, he's a decent addition.What I think this film does is start to shake off the 'Trek is for geeks' branding that you get if you even say you've seen Star Trek. There's still references to original Star Trek work, but what I liked was that you didn't necessarily need to know the fine detail to get into it.With a 4th already approved I'd be interested to see where they go. We've had Romulans, Klingons and Krall. Kirk's back story is the talk of the next film. You never know, Resistance could be futile (oh god, I'm crossing my fingers to hear this in a couple of years!) Overall, i'd highly recommend Beyond. Just the right length, great cast and Lin has proved me wrong. Well done.

To long time Star Trek fans or "Trekkies" if you prefer we all seem to agree on one thing throughout the 50 year history of Trek in all It's inclinations THE ORIGINAL SERIES, THE NEXT GENERATION, DEEP SPACE NINE , VOYAGER, ENTERPRISE and the Films that the worst of them all was "SPOCK'S BRAIN" from the original series. Well let me tell you BEYOND makes SPOCK'S BRAIN look like it belongs in the top 10 of all time episodes. Seeing BEYOND in IMAX 3 D was amazing you were literally part of the film but you did not have the option of leaving that film. I should not even call this piece of garbage a film it was a video game not a film there were explosions, crashes, firefights, hand to hand combat even a motorcycle chase one in which where Captain Kirk emit's a sort of Amber taken from the FRINGE TV series that J.J. Abrams had a hand in making all that would have been fine if their were a plot any plot . This film is going to leave a stain on the storied history of Star trek O it may find a audience one that likes action films but could not care less if there was a plot . To trek Fans Load Phasers and Photons fire at will this disaster needs to be destroyed.

Continuing on the reboot series, Star Trek: Beyond is about the crew of the USS Enterprise as they embark on a rescue mission but soon turns into a test of survival, unity and teamwork. With J.J. Abrams too busy with the Star Wars franchise, Justin Lin (director of several Fast and Furious films) takes the helm and delivers a rather exciting and visually impressive feature. The action was enthralling, the universe was imaginative and oddly enough there was plenty of character development. All the main cast members return and still remain great, especially Karl Urban and the late Anton Yelchin in which both finally got more screen time. Simon Pegg also returns and decided to write the screenplay which many will notice as there is definitely more humour involved, but it's natural wit and not at all forced. The villain of the film, Krall (played by the ever popular Idris Elba), was good if slightly under developed. The visual effects is the main star of the blockbuster and my goodness they look super detailed and still remain consistent even in intense busy action scenes. A couple of moments where Lin decides to use the dreaded 'shaky cam' which can make action sequences difficult to watch, and he also likes to rotate the camera...a lot, it can be quite disorientating at times. Overall, another great entry in what most might consider the best reboot series ever made with intense action, splendid visuals and substantially more character development.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com

If you are a true "Trekkie", .... then you just were treated to yet another episode of fun! So many serious reviews,.... tearing apart every little point; don't read... go see for yourself! I Enjoyed it very much, and look forward to seeing again before it leaves the theaters! Each character was well played and entertaining. The visuals were outstanding - did not see it in 3D, (nor do I think I would want to) the action was very busy and just think that some would be lost in 3D... The story line was simple, as so many Star trek episodes were. It held my attention for two solid hours, with a desire for more when it was over. There are just too many wonderful parts of this next installment of the series - should not be missed.

I LOVE STAR TREK! I also loved the movie! I often wonder why so many people go into these extended reviews as to why or why not they liked or did not like a film. Hey! I just want to be entertained for a few hours and that's about it. The truth is everyone is different and the reasons, notwithstanding, it's each person's individual tastes in film. I think the same about music. With that said, I've loved Star Trek since the late 60's and I love the new crew of the Enterprise. I love the interaction and bond between them and that is what pulls me back, time after time. So, just go to see it for the crew, the story and the fun!

The reboot crew have in the earlier films done an excellent job recreating a lot of the original mannerisms and interactions, getting the characters to play off each really well. So why oh why make a film where these characters hardly get a chance to show what they can do between blowing and being blown up, again? This script misses all that makes a StarTrek film a StarTrek film and turns in a sad rerun of X other high budget blow'em up films with frightening little originality. Wrong director, wrong scriptwriters. The special effect guys can stay, but that is about it. Oh, the actors of course, but let them do their stuff on some halfway decent material next time please. This doesn't make it beyond popcorn, without much of the pop.

I haven't watched any of the original series or its follow up of Star Trek. I always found em extremely boring and the lack of major plot lines that continued thruout the series made em totally unwatchable for me. Because of this the first two new Star Trek movies were extremely positive experiences. All my friends complain that they weren't "Star Trek" cos they were too action oriented... If this was the case then this might be a movie that interests fans of the franchise but average scifi loving movie goer is left totally cold. The characters just aren't interesting, they don't have anything that drags the watcher in and the plot in general is way too common and full of plot holes. However what makes the movie total PAIN to watch is the MTV editing where shot rarely lasts more than second and camera IS SHAKY AS H**L!!! Also 3D effects are totally lost since movie is so dark that 3D makes it look blurry.

STAR TREK BEYOND was very good. No disappointments whatsoever. They maintained the quality, the thematic content of intelligence vs force which has always been the hallmark of the Star Trek series, and they inserted some great nostalgia and a nice touch with Leonard Nimoy. Overall, high action, good twist on the plot, some laughs and light- heartedness to offset the grimmer aspects. I have to say that Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, who play Kirk and Spock respectively, are excellent players for these parts. They stand on their own, even though they are, in the back of our minds, representing icons of the Star Trek franchise from the original cast of the 1960s. STAR TREK BEYOND presents a glimpse of the future which is coming - it's just a matter of time and technology. Someday, just like landing men on the moon back in the 1930s and 1940s was considered "science fiction", the perspectives depicted in this film will some day become fact and no longer be seen as sci-fi. Definitely a recommended watch.

I am a trekkie who has watched everything Star Trek related from the past 50 years including every film and TV show. Although I've enjoyed the rebooted films, they never quite had the same magic as the originals. Until Star Trek Beyond, that is! Star Trek Beyond is the third installment in what is being called the "Kelvin timeline" of Star Trek with the rebooted universe of Kirk's storyline. Compared to Star Trek 2009 and "Into Darkness", this film felt astronomically more like a Star Trek film. I was absolutely blown away; what I thought was going to be a mindless, action-oriented Star Trek movie, was actually a brilliantly written and directed Star Trek film that felt more than fitting in the Star Trek universe.The spoiler-free storyline; the Enterprise is sent to investigate the disappearance of an alien race's crew in a nebula. The Enterprise (per the trailers...) ends up getting destroyed and the crew held hostage on an alien world that is used as a "booby trap" for countless other species that have also been tricked into exploring the nebula in one way or another. Throughout the story, we are not only introduced to new alien races, but also are introduced to past elements of Star Trek, included a desolate/abandoned NX-class starship! This film pays enormous tribute to not only "Star Trek Enterprise" and it's story-arch, but other Star Trek films/shows as well. For the die- hard trekkies, there is plenty to think and talk about after seeing the movie, as there are tons of references and connections made to the rest of the Star Trek universe (including ancestors of Star Trek characters seen in later series...).Furthermore, the movies makes a touching tribute to the death of Leonard Nimoy, by announcing the death of Spock Prime. It was done in a very tasteful and respectful way, and I believe most trekkies and die-hard fans would agree that it was only fitting to announce the death of his character in the film. Simon Pegg and the new director did a phenomenal job on this film. It felt so much more like a Star Trek film, at least to me, than the previous ones. The storyline was much more original than the retelling of the "wrath of Khan" events. Chris Pine is also really starting to hone-in on his role of Captain Kirk. Not only was the acting better, but the script this time around made him much more into the masterful Captain Kirk we grew up with in TOS and less of a party-boy. Overall, Star Trek Beyond fantastic Star Trek film. I can't believe I am endorsing and praising it as much as I am, but in my opinion, they got it right this time. After seeing this, I am starting to have more faith/confidence in the new cast continuing the Star Trek legacy and I look forward to the new films that come out in the series. If you're an old-school fan, give this one a try. It's a fun adventure and feels appropriate in the Star Trek universe.

This is my review for Star Trek: Beyond (spoiler free)****(4/5) Cast:Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, Karl Urban, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Sofia Boutella and Idris Elba Plot: The USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a new ruthless enemy Krall (Elba) who puts them and everything the Federation stands for to the test.Now I just want to say that I am not a full Trekkie but I am a fan.After J. J Abrams left to make Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) Trek was left alone for a little while until it into the hands, of a fan that's right director Justin Lin also known for 4 Fast & Furious movies, which were then left to the hands of horror master James Wan. The first motion picture in 1979 was made by a fan Robert Wise now deceased and it go so well but that didn't stop Trek. Now when the first reboot came out in 2009 a lot of older generation fans didn't want to see it but in my perspective I like both Treks old and new I think that new introduce the new generation into the franchise. In my personal opinion they are brilliant and it's the same with this one.Set a little under three years into the exploration journey with the Enterprise and the crew are little tired, as they enter the uncharted parts of space, and the CGI is absolutely stunning and is a brilliant continuation from Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013) and this time they are under attack from an even newer and meaner villain, in the form of Idris Elba's Krall or Krawl as it's pronounced in the film he is Klingon by origin but not really Klingon. If you remember the last time we saw the Klingons was in Into Darkness for a few minutes until they were killed of by Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan on their home world Kronos. However the Enterprise crew discover that he was never a monster at all eventually but I won't reveal anymore because spoilers.Just like the other two reboots this has insane fast-paced action and talking although the dialogue in this one is much more funny and much more fast-paced, but don't let put you off. One other thing a lot of people were concerned if this would turn into a Fast and Furious movie well no of course it wouldn't, it looks nothing like the Fast franchise. Even though this is set a little under two years into the journey does that effect the story? answer no it may have two new writers but the story is still the same dynamic story as the other two apart from a new meaner villain but that's to be expected.Once the Enterprise is stranded on a planet they seek the help of Sofia Boutella's Jaylah who's family was killed by Krall and his clan when she was young, she is just as good as she is in 2014's Kingsman although more bad-ass than Kingsman which is weird, anyway she has a lot of new toys for the crew of the Enterprise. Also another thing Sxotty's (Pegg) is a lot stronger than the previous Trek reboots. The entire of the Enterprise is separated and some of them are forced to work together even though some may not like it, yes I'm talking about Bones (Urban) and Spock (Quinto). Although Kirk (Pine) more bad-ass than ever and Chekov (Yelchin) do get to know each other a lot more, if you remember in the previous Trek's Checkov didn't really speak that much well not as much as we'd hoped. Anyway Beyond ends promisingly and in terms of previous summer blockbusters like Legend of Tarzan this one is certain to not disappoint to even the most veteran fans, who prefer the older Trek's.Finally in the end credit's and throughout the film we do see a firm but memorable goodbye to the old Spock Leonard Nimoy, and in the end credits it says for Anton because of his shocking untimely demise last month but that doesn't stop the performance that you see Checkov pull off. He had many great performances like in Green Room (2015) one of my favourite films of the year. But unfortunately his very short and promising career came to an end and this is just one of his last films, but his performance is still as good as ever. Remembering Anton Yelchin 1989-2016.Apart from that all-in-all this new Trek will not disappoint and is certainly one of the best and most kick-ass films this year.Verdict: Beyond delivers all the fast-paced action like the other reboots and has certainly made Trek good again. This is a brilliant start to the 50th Anniversary, but let's see what the next 50 years holds in store for Trek.8/10 a rip-roaring good time.

The movie as a whole was decent. It did not quite capture the magic of the first entry nor the intensity of the second. Being third often comes with these issues and we've seen it many times before. Ahem..Dark Knight Rises anyone?That said, this movie does have many very entertaining moments and more than a few tugs of the heartstrings for those who reserve a special place in their lives for Star Trek universe and it's characters.I offer no spoilers, and I may be only speaking for myself, but there is a critical moment in the film that literally gave me goose bumps with some accompaniment from a certain New York based trio that everyone will recognize in this franchise. This moment alone made the price of admission worth while.See it in a theater, rent it on DVD, wait for it to come on television, it doesn't matter. If you are a fan of the franchise, especially this rebooted universe, Star Trek Beyond is worth a look.

Just got out of Star Trek 'Beyond'. What a disappointment! Just a noisy boring mess. Yes there was a lot of action.. but the characters were forgotten and just looked bored as well.I will say I am a bit of a 'Star Trek' fan. So for me.. this didn't live up to the basic Star Trek level. Which means a decent story and some interesting plot elements. This movie just didn't care about the plot and just wanted to blow things up. If you are just looking for explosions than I guess it does handle that part OK.I felt a bit bad for the actors. Sure they get paid well... but their talents were just wasted by the director. You could see they just didn't care too much and nothing was really clicking.Sure there were a few good moments... but I actually thought about walking out of the theater at a few points.Just could have been so much better. Boo.

The revived Star Trek franchise was not lucky so far. First, the action-packed eleventh installment, but without any sense. Then, the remake of Wrath of Khan, which also left a lot to desire. Finally, we have the third episode from the new series and it is undoubtedly the best one. Of course, all required elements are still here. Instead of the philosophical questions and clever plot, we have the fast pacing adventure movie with clearly drawn lines between good and evil. Right now the crew of Enterprise seems to be a good team, able to solve any problem. Here and there are some more serious questions asked, like pacifism against the miliratism (exploited earlier in the Wing Commander IV game, for instance), or the need to unify with your enemies for the good of all species (very up to date in the modern world, isn't it?). This is, however, overshadowed by the well defined plot presenting the struggle of the Federation finest crew against another villain (this time, much better developed than in previous movies).The cast is good, that is if you already accepted the new crew of Enterprise. All new characters are interesting and do not disappoint. Surprisingly, the bad guys are quite effective in what they do and their motivations are convincing. The chemistry between the main Enterprise crew members exists, spiced by the appropriate sense of humour. The special effect again are top-notch, flawlessly combining the action scenes with the outer space sequences. All is balanced, so the suspension of disbelief is possible this time. The techno-babble is present, but not very annoying (just like in the Star Trek: Enterprise series), therefore it serves its purpose of mysteriously explaining some crucial twists in the plot. Music is also passable, maybe not as good as in the new Star Wars, but Michael Giacchino efficiently used the well-known Star Trek tunes and transformed them into something new. We have then everything that is required: grand space battles, close combat, chases and proper moral choices. True fans of the series will not be disappointed - homage to the already existing world was paid a couple of times as well. J.J. Abrams had a difficult task to bring the Star Trek to the broader audience and, despite failing in most aspects of previous movies, he was able to do so. Justin Lin stood before the easier challenge, as he just had to do a good action movie in space. Indeed he succeeded, bringing us the summer blockbuster free from the utter nonsense, delivering enough action and consistent future world to please both die-hard Star Trek fans and ordinary people wanting just to spend pleasantly two hours in the cinema. Sure, this is not the intellectual feast, but it wasn't meant to be. Let's hope the next episode will keep at least this level of quality.

The best thing about Beyond is the fact that it fixes to some degree, the two things I had a problem with in the first 2 rebooted films; lack of any good female characters and an absence of the fun tone that made older films so great. While there's still some minor gripes here and there that I had, Beyond is the most fun you'll have with Trek since 1986.It took 4 years for us to get 'Into Darkness' since the reboot in 2009 and it took another 3 years for Beyond to come out on the amply timed 50th anniversary of the series' inception. Even so, the wait was definitely worth it. Not only is Beyond the most fun Trek film in decades, it balances its ensemble cast perhaps better than any previous entry. The fun tone can be attributed to Justin Lin's time spent making the Fast and Furious films but I was surprised at just how well he takes each cast member's strengths and makes one cohesive story.Of course, complementing the cast with a talent like Idris Elba as the lead villain (Krall), doesn't hurt. Khan made his stamp in 2013, but I was open to a different type of villain for this go around, especially because the film takes place entirely in outer space. This opened the door for more aliens, space battles, and plenty of set pieces and well-handled green screen effects. One of those aliens, Jaylah, played by Sofia Boutella, was particularly good.If you think about it, the Star Trek universe has been in need of a strong female character for years. Yes, Uhura is solid, but it seems like that's been it, at least in the reboots. Boutella not only throws some punches in the battlefield, but she holds her own up against Kirk and Scotty, whom she shares the most screen time with. She's definitely someone who I hope to see in future installments.The film starts off with a rapid pace and an epic boarding scene with Krall's crew, but it takes a bit for the pacing to pick up once again. After the Enterprise is taken down, the crew gets separated and I think that's where the story starts to suffer. The cast is so good when they're together, so I didn't find the middle act to be all that compelling.I was glad to see the subtle tributes to Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin, who both passed away since the last Trek entry, amongst balancing this huge spectacle. But yet, still, the best part about this film is how much fun it is from beginning to end. The humor is amped up even though the stakes are the same. Trek is at an all- time high right now. Beyond will be one of the best theater experiences you'll have this summer and such a pleasant surprise for just how weak 2016 has been.+Way more fun than previous entries+Jaylah+Great use of ensemble+Entirely in space-Middle act is sluggish8.8/10

Produce by JJ Abrams, but not JJ's version of Star Trek, due to a new director at the helm, which I find fascinating as I know, Justin Lin from his run as director of the blockbuster half of The Fast and The Furious Franchise This movie is not the action adventure we saw in the first two segments of the Star Trek reboot or what we see in the Fast and Furious epic. It's episodic the same way Into Darkness was to 2009's Star Trek, but Star Trek Beyond acts so much more like an episode of Star Trek rather than a movie, which I love, because I like Star Trek as a TV series more than I like it as a motion picture.It's not the solar glossy flares that Abrams did (and totally brought life to the dead franchise, so this is not me putting down what the Episode seven director did at all). It's a quiet and slow moving pace that builds on the depth of the characters we know and love and the sophistication of the story, that is more what we expect from Star Trek, but at the same time keeping with the fact that this has to appeal to a contemporary audience. The movie takes place three years into the five year mission (Or when the original series ended). Not the same man who beat the Kobayashi Maru, Kirk realizes his career in StarFleet was more him trying to be like his father than being his own man. They honor the death of Leonard Nimoy with a story in which Spock Prime's death makes Spock contemplate his importance among the Vulcans who are still an endangered species. These guys need a boost in moral.In comes Krall, who sucker punches the Enterprise, forcing them to crash land on a hostile planet so he can get his hands on a weapon he wishes to use to end the Federation. Kirk needs to find his crew and get them off the planet in order to stop this lizard-like dictator's plan The first five to ten minutes of the movie were visually amazing. Wait till you see the space station York Town, it's fantastic. The movie attempts to be big like Abrams, episode Seven, and they did it. The backdrop of the planet was quite nice too, but the Enterprise itself not impressive. It felt too cartoonish (And they seem to always change the look of warp speed in every movie, which I really don't like) Based on the End Credits this seems like the smallest cast of the rebooted movies. It's so sad that Anton Yelchin past away, and even sadder after seeing this movie. Chekov was a big part of Star Trek Beyond, far bigger than he was in the other two movies. I'm glad they made the time to dedicate the movie to him (As well as being in memory of Leonard Nimoy).Not surprising, Simon Pegg got to show off that Mr. Scott was more than just an Engineer (That's what happens when you co-write the film). Not that his role in the other two films were not big and important, but Scotty gets to get out of the engine room and more into the field of action.New Character, Jaylah was a cool addiction to the Star Trek franchise. She became this quick and perfectly done homage to what the whole purpose of Star Trek is about. We meet a new alien and it's all about getting over the culture clash and working together. This happens a few times in the movie, some positive, some not.Idris Elba is a a perfect Star Trek villain. He does this thing were his grasp of the English language is minimal keeping his bad guy speeches to the point. He's proof that it takes a great actor to do the work behind all the make up. Is he better than Khan? Is he better than Cumberbatch's Kahn? Time can only answer this question as it's a close call. Plus Star Trek Beyond gives an impressive effort to be diverse. Not just white guys in alien make up to prove how diverse the Galaxy is, but more different colored faces in the mix to prove how diverse Earth is. In Into Darkness, they showed how natural interracial couples are in the utopian future, and in Beyond they showed us that Same sex marriages exist without making it a big deal (Although the person they pick to show this is a big deal (but no real surprise to any Trekker).Michael Giacchino still makes the awesome soundtrack for the franchise. I love what he does with it and I'm glad he's still doing it cause I do love how it adds to making it feel more like an episode, plus this guy's a boss film composer. It's a fun movie that I want to see over and over again. Abrams got Star Trek back in the game and Star Trek beyond has us playing for keeps. The new pace did take some getting use to, and I spotted some small trivial things that raised my eyebrow (What appears like Dr. McCoy's so-so knowledge of the Vulcan body), but overall, it's more like Star Trek, It uses it's budget to make space bigger and the Galaxy more impressive to watch than making a high octane action movie. It has a top notch villain, and it honors Gene Roddenberry's vision of a world united with a little more vast diversity of cast that mirrors what's happening in the world today.http://cinemagardens.com/?p=71

Star Trek Beyond is an entertaining extension to the two movies that shows us some of the same character chemistry and action as in the previous two, but fails to provide the kind of original development of story and style that we saw in Into Darkness. In terms of the basic movie experience you get, little new is introduced, with the exception of more action on the ground than in space. Rather, the character chemistry is recycled along with the humor (Spock and Bones scenes). It's still fun to see the same guys in new situations as the acting is great and dialogue does not especially disappoint. However, what made the previous two movies so much better was that all of this took place in a coherent storyline accompanied by determined and vicious villains. In Beyond , the motives of the villain seem unclear even by the end of the movie and his presentation, despite attempts to make him look intelligent, lacks the kind of originality as in the case of Khan and instead, his entire character looks rather cliché. And despite seeing the good characters, their personal stories are not really developed in any significant manner and by the end of the movie, all of them seem quite in the same spot as they were in the beginning of the movie, or even in the end of the first movie. To sum up, Beyond feels like a necessary sequel that was made just so we could see more of the old characters in action, but as a stand alone movie, it lacks the originality to make it memorable. Conclusion: entertaining, but forgettable.

There are those movies where you know you can just sit back and absorb anything they trow at you. You know you'll get a lot of fast action scenes, maybe some humor, a near-zero story line and even less logic. The Independence Day sequel is such a movie, and - apparently - Star Wars Beyond is too. It shouldn't be, but it is.The latest Star Wars sequel takes you from one illogical scene to the next, without any explanation or any attempt to let the viewer settle into it. The whole movie is a continuous repetition of trowing in some sci-fi tech babble and use that to initiate an action scene. As seems to be the formula with most action-based blockbusters these days, they make sure the pace is high enough so you don't have time to think about what's actually going on, and how little sense it all makes.Apparently writing a decent storyline is to much of an effort, especially when you can just fill in the blanks with some supposedly explanatory rambling, an attempt at humor or just don't bother at all. And why should you? Your movie is remake 2 or 3 or sequel 4 or 5. It's a guaranteed hit at the box office.Where are the days where creating a successful sequel was an actual challenge...

So tired of this reboot. I wanted so badly for Beyond to redeem itself from Into Darkness but no chance of that. As a Sci-Fi/Star Trek fan, I am finding this reboot series of movies so unworthy of the vision Roddenberry intended. No offense to the actors at all, its really the character development vision and lack of imagination in the story telling. During this movie, the guy next to me feel asleep and I can understand why. It wasn't fun, it wasn't funny, it was boring. What happened? I can only hope that CBS will have something more intelligent, exciting and imaginative with their new ST series. Beyond is a paint by numbers movie. The only thing I liked was the space station environment of Yorktown. Can Hollywood please make good science fiction movies for adults PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The latest film from the Star Trek series is probably the weakest, and it definitely shows the traces of being a TV show. Poor locations on sound stages, hackneyed dialogue that is all too familiar, and mediocre camera work all conspire to make you wish you could use the fast forward button. Combine that with incomprehensible mumbled talk that makes you wish you could go backward to see what the heck they said. Very disappointing.Perhaps the worst feature in a film that has very few redeeming qualities at all, is the villain, who is among the weakest villains in cinematic history, despite having the very capable actor underneath all the reptilian makeup.You don't need to see this on the big screen. In fact, you don't have to see this at all.

I went to see this in English and no 3D. I enjoyed it, it's a pretty entertaining movie. Good stuff in it is pretty much the same as previous two: LOVE the trio of Spock-Bones-Kirk, I think they really get it right ESPECIALLY Karl Urban with McCoy whose quotes just are right out of DeForest Kelley's mouth. Uhura is also very good. I thought the action scenes were pretty fair and entertaining. I don't want to compare it too much to the other two films as I'm not reviewing them, but this one definitely seemed to have the least ambition of the three and for that is probably my least favorite. Jayla the new character was well acted but very poorly fleshed out I thought, I won't say more to keep from spoiling anything. Villain was decent but very run-of-the-mill. Simon Pegg did a good job on the script I thought and there are some funny moments.. Scotty says "lassie" a little too often for me though but fair enough. :P I do wish more time had been allowed for old and new characters to be really fleshed out, in some points you seem to sort of jump into someone's past or current problems and it does feel a bit forced.To conclude, if you enjoyed the first two films and are looking for an entertaining night out, I think this is pretty good, it was worth my 10$. This one is not as good as the first one though who had it all for me. Are they trying to dumb it down? Perhaps unfortunately. But yeah do go see it, people around me seemed to enjoy it quite a bit too. CHeers

At least once in your life, you've probably had a pair of shoes that you really loved and had for a long time. They still looked cool and felt good and you didn't want to give them up even though they were getting pretty old. I mean, why get rid of them? They were comfortable in more ways than one. Sure, you had to change out the laces more than once and maybe learned to live with a hole here or a scratch there, but they were YOUR shoes – your FAVORITE shoes – and you still enjoyed having them around.For many Movie Fans, the "Star Trek" franchise is a lot like that "favorite old pair of shoes". Just in time for the 50th anniversary of the original series' TV premiere, comes "Star Trek Beyond" (PG-13, 2:00), the 13th of the "Star Trek" films and the third one in the rebooted series which started in 2009. This one features a cast with which we've become comfortable (as they've obviously become very comfortable with each other) and keeps that "favorite old pair of shoes" marching forward by drawing on the sole (soul) of the original series' "five year mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before." (Even though it's now "where no one has gone before" – a slight change in wording for inclusiveness, but just as familiar, and just as comfortable.) "Star Trek Beyond" picks up in the third year of that five year mission begun at the end of 2013's "Star Trek Into Darkness". Just over half-way through their journey, the crew seems restless – especially Capt. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) who is seeking a promotion within Starfleet. Kirk's first officer, Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto), gets some news which also makes him reconsider his proper role in the universe – and his relationship with their ship's Communications Officer, Lieutenant Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana). Chief Medical Officer, Lieutenant Commander Leonard "Bones" McCoy (Karl Urban) ends up providing comfort to Kirk and, ironically also to Spock, as Bones' favorite human and not-so-favorite Vulcan go soul-searching (not, I repeat, NOT a shoe reference). Of course, Chief Engineer, Lieutenant Commander Montgomery "Scotty" Scott (Simon Pegg) is along for his technical expertise – and a generous dose of comic relief. Last, but certainly not least, back on the bridge of the Enterprise are Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) and Ensign Pavel Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin who died a month before the film's release).During a stop at a mammoth Federation outpost called Yorktown (looking like the futuristic set of 2015's "Tomorrowland" on steroids), the Enterprise gets sent on a mission to rescue the crew of a vessel that was supposedly disabled on the other side of a massive nebula. Kalara (Lydia Wilson), the alien who claims to be the only member of her ship's crew able to escape the crippled vessel and go for help, leads Kirk and company into a trap. A devastating attack on the Enterprise ends with the ship's officers and most of its crew stranded on the surface of a Class M planet, with some of them separated from each other. Scotty soon finds himself working with an alien scavenger named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), who offers her help in locating his shipmates in exchange for his help in fixing the disabled ship in which she has been living. Meanwhile, Spock and Bones are stuck in the middle of nowhere (with Spock badly injured), while Kirk and Chekov are out and about looking for the rest of their shipmates, who are being held by a reptilian-like human (or is he a human-like reptile?) named Krall (Idris Elba) and his soldiers.Krall is after something Kirk has in his possession – the missing component of a terrible biological weapon which Kirk thought was just an ancient artifact that he had been transporting as a peace offering from one alien civilization to another. With that setup, all that our favorite Starfleet troopers have to do is figure out who to trust and stay alive long enough to find each other on a previously unknown planet, keep Krall from assembling his weapon and get off that planet and back to the security of the Federation of Planets. Simple, right? Simple as breaking in a new pair of shoes! As our heroes try to do all of this, they come up with some typically creative solutions to seemingly impossible problems, there's a very good twist, and Movie Fans get to go for another walk in one of our favorite pair of shoes."Star Trek Beyond" is everything you'd want from a Star Trek film more or less. The plot is fairly well-constructed, but keeps the main cast in separate locations for too much of the story. The script, by Pegg and Doug Jung (who also appears briefly on screen) overdoes the humor just a little, but it also features some nicely quotable lines. The direction by Justin Lin (he of the "Fast and Furious" franchise) gives us a nice balance of frenetic action and that good, old-fashioned bold, selfless Star Trek spirit. It would've been nearly impossible to top the last two Star Trek films and this one doesn't quite get there, but it comes close. It is worth putting on your favorite comfortable pair of shoes to go out and see it. "A-"

Whether you like the newest Star Trek movie will really depend a lot on what you like in a movie. If you love near-constant action, tons of amazing special effects and explosions, then there is more than enough to delight you. On the other hand, if you want a film that is more plot-driven and a multidimensional villain whose actions make any sense, then you are also in for a big letdown.The plot is very, very simple. Enterprise is sent on a rescue mission that turns out to be a trap. A baddie and his minions attack and blow up a lot of stuff. Most of the crew is taken prisoner or killed and it's up to the rest of the crew to figure out a way to rescue them and save the quadrant. There really isn't much more to it than this.Apart from the breathtaking special effects, the film is nice because like all the newer Trek films, it doesn't all rest on the big three--Kirk, Spock and McCoy. There is a nice ensemble feel to it and everyone contributes about equally. Additionally, the crew's new friend, Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), is an excellent character-- strikingly beautiful and amazingly tough as well as likable. I anticipate you'll be seeing more of her in upcoming installments of the franchise.As far as the bad about the film goes, the baddie is played by the excellent actor, Idris Elba. However, he's hidden under such thick prosthetics through most of the film that he seem wasted at times. Additionally, his actions and motivations just seemed confusing and muddled. Also confusing was the big confrontation scene at the end where he and Kirk square off. Now considering if Elba's character wins, he might be able to kill millions...or more. So what does Kirk do? Instead of instantly killing the guy once he's gotten the upper hand, they stop and chat a bit! What?! Kirk's spent the entire film trying to defeat the guy and the villain is nearly invincible and hell-bent on genocide...you talk and give him a chance to escape?! It just came off as anticlimactic and a bit silly.

Major Trek fan, and extremely disappointed with the movie. Scenes too dark to tell what was happening, camera too jerky during fight scenes, and way too much focus on special effects.Ending was wayyyy too stupid & just generally annoying.This movie is not even bargain bin worthy. I created an account just to help people avoid wasting their time with this mess.I mostly enjoyed the first 2 movies of the reboot, but this one will be the end of the trek movie series(hopefully) ))))))))))) for some reason the IMDb system doesn't think you can summarize in less than 10 lines.

After watching Star Trek Beyond I can truly say that this movie was way over-hyped. Definitely not one of the top five in the franchise.Maybe it was the 3D version that I saw; but for most of the movie I was straining to see what was happening on the screen. When I could make out what was going on it was much too busy--sort of like the bad Transformer movies.The story wasn't bad; but it seemed to me that they tried too hard to make sure each character had ample screen time. Less would have been more in this case.I also don't say this too often; but if the movie was 1/2 hour or 45 minutes longer they could have added more meat to the story. I guess Idris Elba did as much as he could with the Krall character; but his villain seemed like a bad James Bond villain--you know the kind that explains everything to Bond instead of just killing him.The best part of the movie is when the aliens are destroying the enterprise; but the aliens were so effective and destructive that none of the crew should have survived the attack.Karl Urban and Zachary Quinto do a nice job playing Bones and Spock; but in this rendition it seemed to me like they were doing bad imitations.

Put it bluntly, it's the movie that Nemesis should have been in terms of consistent action that still draws upon characterization, that remains true to Trek without using previous Treks like a crutch (the whole Trekish thing Simon Pegg talked about). It abandons the worn out Star Trek formula by drawing its strength on excellent writing that balances action, story, humour and character, but remains true to the core or the soul of Star Trek.Everyone, even the newcomers, did an exceptional job in their own regard while allowing themselves to grow on their own while still being true to the original series characters. The new feel gives it the old Star Trek vibe that allows the new generation to appreciate, while at the same time allows you to move with the heroes while you uncover the mystery of the villains such as Krall.Though numerous spoiler free hints to previous Treks, they don't infringe upon the story, nor do they take it over and without pushing it right into your face that this is Star Trek.One of the finest pieces of art I have ever seen, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, walk with people like Kirk and Spock, Trek at its excellence that is only overshadowed by "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan" itself.One of the best movies this year, one of the best Star Trek movies of all time, give Star Trek Beyond 10/10.

Set three years after the events of Into Darkness, this third entry into the revamped Star Trek cinematic universe takes the USS Enterprise crew even deeper into space where their exploratory mission, not unexpectedly, takes a turn for the worse. Presented more like a stand-alone voyage as opposed to a direct sequel, the wholesale change made amongst the crew – the director, writers and cinematographer from the first two instalments are all replaced – is sorely felt in both tone and execution. There's no sense that any of these characters have changed since we last trekked into the vast unknown with them, despite it being set a few years later, and this film cares little about building on the major relationships already established. So instead of a continuation of the Kirk-Spock, Spock-Uhura, Kirk-Bones story lines that have been steadily growing, our beloved protagonists are plopped into an escape mission that feels rather inconsequential to the overall franchise. New hero Jayla (the magnetic Sofia Boutella) is a shot of adrenaline when she arrives part way through, but the big bad Krall (Idris Elba under heavy prosthetics) is rather underwhelming. Karl Urban's Bones shines brightest from the returning cast with a plethora of hilarious one-liners. Replacing J.J. Abrams in the head job, director Justin Lin (no slouch in the action department with Fast and Furious 4, 5, 6 under his belt) concocts some striking sequences, albeit rarely breaking from the sci-fi blockbuster mould. A first-act aerial ambush on the Enterprise offers some brutal and breathtaking moments, whilst a daring prison-escape set piece is rousing and a grand last-act onslaught (ingeniously incorporating Beastie Boys hit "Sabotage") gets the heart pounding. Boldly going where many Star Trek outings have gone before, Beyond is a massive step down from its modern predecessors and a missed opportunity for further growth of these famous characters. Thankfully the intergalactic skirmishes are exhilarating enough to justify a big-screen viewing.

For one thing, there's Chris Pine as Capt. James T. Kirk. He's far less of an incorrigible smart-a** in this film than he was in the first two flicks. A little more disciplined. In fact, his Jim Kirk sounds even more world-wearier than Shatner's from STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN! And, in the real world, such emotional burn-out can be all-too plausibly devastating for people so chronologically young. Then, there's Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock.His reaction over the death of the "other" Mr. Spock (the venerable Vulcan ambassador from an alternate "future") is one that's mentally echoed by all true fans of the original STAR TREK franchise over the past fifty years. In fact, as the ambassador, himself, might put it:"It is probably the one emotional reaction in the universe that is paradoxically quite logical."But, of course, it was Anton Yelchin's final performance, as young Mr. Chekov that drew the attention of everyone in the movie theater I went to see this at. Maybe it's just me. Yet, he seemed to be the one cast member, among these relatively still new-comers, to have settled into his decidedly classic role the most comfortably. Even more so than Quinto's Spock and the new Dr. McCoy, put together. And they had some of the wittiest dialogue in the film!The only reason I don't give this film a perfect ten, however, is that little bit of calendrical miscalculation during the recording of Jim's log entry at the beginning. Just multiply 365 times 3 if you want to catch my drift.

While the previous two Star Trek films have had their moments, I have been a bit underwhelmed with them, overall. I really need to tip my cap to Doug Jung and Simon Pegg for steering things into a new direction.The gripes about "Trek" have been that old Trek is too many discussions and new Trek is too much action ... these gripes aren't without merit at times, but this time I think they found a happy medium by doing something that has not really happened in the first two films, and was a trademark of the best parts of the original series - focusing on character interaction. Without going into too much, the middle part of the film sees the crew split up into groups where they are forced to interact, and the overall effect is good. In between the more philosophical opening and closing are some excellent action scenes. It is really a strong example of a well planned out, well rounded film for this genre. While revealed a bit of a ham-handed manner, there is even a really nice plot twist in the plot that gives a nice (albeit, not too subtle) message about the need to change if we want to see a better society.The visuals are excellent, with particular praise for the Yorktown station which looks like something M.C. Escher would have come up with after several nights of hard drinking. It might be the single best visual in any "Trek" film or TV episode.This easily ranks as the best "Trek" film since "First Contact" ... but in certain ways, it might even be the best since "Wrath of Khan" for getting back to exploring the characters we have come to love.

I saw "Star Trek Beyond", starring Chris Pine-Into the Woods, Unstoppable; Zachary Quinto-Hit-man:Agent 47, American Horror Story_tv; Sofia Boutella-Kingsman:The Secret Service, StreetDance 2 and Idris Elba-The Thor movies, No Good Deed.This is the 3rd in the new Star Trek series-the first one in 2009 and Into Darkness in 2013-and I think they are getting the hang of what made the original TV series good. The comradery between the main characters and the hopefulness for a bright future. Chris returns as Kirk, as does Zachery as Spock. And, of course, all the other newbees are back, too- Karl Urban/Bones, Zoe Saldana/Uhura, Simon Pegg/Scotty, John Cho/Sulu and Anton Yelchin/Chekov. FYI: Anton died about a month before the release of this movie-6/19/16-and is acknowledged at the end of the movie, as well as Leonard Nimoy. The plot goes something like this, Chris and his crew are sent to rescue a ship that is in distress in uncharted space when things go south quickly. They discover a planet that lures ships into their clutches and then Idris/Krall plunders them for slave labor and other, more evil intentions-he has some kind of energy siphoning powers that he uses on people. Of course, it's hard to recognize Idris in his alien make-up as Krall but they do show what he looks like before he became Krall, so you know it is him. Idris uses these neat mechanical drones-they look like a swarm of bees-to attack and disable his victims. When Chris and company are stranded, they meet other castaways and the most interesting and helpful is Sofia/Jaylah. There is lots of action and humor scattered throughout the movie and several nods to the original cast members are also there-and I do mean all of the main actors. It ends with a teaser for another installment in the franchise so don't be too worried about this being the last one. It's rated "PG-13" for sci-fi action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes. I really liked this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.

As far as blockbuster franchises go, the current Star Trek series has been undergoing a distinctly palpable identity crisis. Should it wholly embrace its blockbuster marketing, aiming for go-for- broke action to attract the popcorn audience in droves? Or should it aspire to reach loftier ideals of character development, intellectualizing about existence as the crew gets caught up in seemingly intractable story lines (and timelines)? The good news is that Star Trek Beyond successfully manages to do both, incorporating terrific sound design and seamless visuals in a plot that respects its sci-fi pedigree. It harks back to Gene Roddenberry's idealistic principles of unity, diversity, and inclusion, while at the same time throwing a winking nod towards the growing cinematic predilection for fun and silliness. In this regards, Star Trey Beyond owes a huge debt of gratitude to the hugely successful Guardians of the Galaxy, which reinvigorated audience interest in space odysseys that are, well, fun. And fun this certainly is. For two hours well-spent, don't miss Star Trek Beyond on the big screen.

For all so critical of the movie, how would know what Gene would approve of, & those Who require Sci-fi to be Sci-fi...... Get over it, movies are made to entertain, if you don't care for all the action & destruction, go watch the "Note Book", get in touch with yourself, watch reruns...... You can live in the past. What did you expect, Justin Lin directed it. Love the new cast for this franchise, sorry about Anton, hope they cast a good one. With the exception of Ulhura, all replacement cast do a very good job of replicating the original members, I have to be fair, original Ulhura did not really interact with crew as much as the current character, glad she has more of a role now. I'm already looking forward to the new installment.

All "beats and shouting" is how one character describes the classical twentieth century strains of The Beastie Boys, and it could just as well describe Justin "Fast & Furious" Lin's entry into the Star Trek cinematic canon, its thirteenth instalment.Three years into their five-year mission and life aboard the Enterprise is getting pretty boring. (I know, right? Our hearts bleed for these brave handsome space explorers.) They park up at a moon-sized starbase called Yorktown, where they are visited by an alien refugee who says her people have been attacked.The Enterprise investigates, traversing a nebula before finding a hostile swarm of ships. (Incidentally, the pacing by this point is typical of the film as a whole: insufficient build-up to an overlong action payoff.) The Enterprise is overwhelmed, and boarded by the swarm's commander, Krall (Idris Elba). Krall wants an alien artefact in Kirk's (Chris Pine) possession.As a result of the battle the Enterprise crew crash land on a local planet. Separated, some are captured by Krall and his drones. Kirk's scattered team, with the help of clichéd huntress Jaylah (genuinely named after J-Law, and played by Sofia Boutella), must find a way to rescue their friends and escape the planet before Krall and co destroy Yorktown.An opening gag, a comical encounter involving a bestial alien race, sets the cartoon tone for the movie. The set even resembles the Klingon courtroom from The Undiscovered Country – and it was the first of many times that I felt the series' heritage was being referenced in a faintly mocking way. When every line involving that rich pseudo-science jargon is being flipped into a joke it comes across as dumbing down to the point of contempt.I feel this point is important enough to labour, particularly as some of the marketing has harkened back to the likes of The Motion Picture – a thoughtful work of philosophical sci-fi to which this bears no resemblance. Being stupid isn't in itself a problem, but when a film continually references its forebears, both on screen and off, one cannot but feel that history is being exploited.When nu-Spock is coming to terms with his mortality and his fearful exclamations are laughed off by his supposed friends Bones and Kirk (who, in a diluted allusion to Wrath of Khan's birthday scene, had themselves earlier discussed mortality), you question whether these characters – the very soul of Trek – are being taken seriously.Being co-written by Simon Pegg, it should come as no surprise that the bro-banter is in full force; and, in Beyond's defence, it sometimes works in the quieter moments. When the crew is paired off we do get some interesting matchings: Kirk and Checkov (the late Anton Yelchin); Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban); Scotty (Pegg) and Jaylah. The strongest scenes are the simple ones where they're exploring this strange new world and mutually building their characters.However. Maybe it's a reference to the original third film's subtitle, but poor Spock is missing for large parts; and when he is on screen his moodiness comes across less like a character's grief and more like an actor's embarrassment. You can almost see his despair at the direction the series is taking: A franchise hungrier than ever to knock the techno-babble on the head and move on to the next starship-flipping setpiece.(Just wait until you get to the part with the musical weapon. It will determine if you're on board with this mission or it'll be your escape pod moment. I found it risible: not smart-silly, just shark-jumping.)Another Star Trek movie, another frustrated madman having a tantrum. But unlike Nero or Kahn, Krall's motivations are vague and implausible, and Idris Elba's performance is unconvincing. It's not helped by his character's obsession with the ancient artefact he covets: a MacGuffin so mysterious that it cannot be adequately explained through exposition, and which produces a lame CG effect like something out of The Mummy.Lin mimics JJ Abrams' kinetic style but it's all bluster and no rhythm or rhyme. His clunky direction and the chaotic editing (four editors, seemingly at odds with each other) undermine any sense of local geography or the relationship between subjects. This particularly comes to the fore in the final act, where any narrative ingenuity gives way to video game plotting (complete with tool tips and checkpoints) – a succession of confusing complications in lieu of real narrative complexity – and Lin is not up to the task of keeping us informed of the rules and the stakes.Beyond lacks the vitality and novelty of Star Trek '09 and has none of the thrilling personal conflicts or emotional sensitivity of Into Darkness. And more than those films, which were already more flash than flesh, it lacks depth. This is the cinema of spectacle, not ideas. Once, this film series could do both. But Beyond doesn't go beyond passable. And for a crew of this calibre, that's not good enough.

Thus far critics have been lauding Star Trek Beyond as the film that finally brings the Star Trek (1966-1969) ethos into the rebooted series. Like it or not the J.J. Abrams films are now considered mere auditions to The Force Awakens (2015). Indeed, even a glancing look will reveal shades of Star Wars (1977) in everything from the rumble atop the drill in the first film to Khan's monologue-ing in the second. Personally, I'm of the opinion that while Star Trek (2009) is an absolute treasure, Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) felt like the seventh season of a dying TV show.I am however not of the opinion that Star Trek Beyond is a homecoming but more like a best case scenario negotiating the original show's heavy political and philosophical themes with the reboots sleek aesthetic. That best case scenario is even more impressive when you consider director Justin Lin's resume includes the Fast and Furious (2001-2015) let's say "renaissance".Star Trek Beyond begins with Captain Kirk (Pine) contemplating a quarter-life crisis of sorts. He's about to celebrate a birthday marking him one year older than his father ever was. He's considering hanging up his captain's hat and taking an admiral-ship with Star Fleet. His plans are put on hold when the Enterprise is tasked with a search and rescue mission in a unexplored part of a far-away nebula. Once there the Enterprise is ambushed by a mysterious foe named Krall (Elba) who wants a seemingly useless trinket aboard the ship. The Enterprise is overrun, the crew impressed and the bridge's officers are marooned on separate parts of a desolate planet.Captain Kirk's moments of characterization are mirrored almost perfectly by Officer Spock's character arc which has him contemplating resigning from Star Fleet to aid Vulcan diaspora. While not as laced with Kentucky whiskey as Kirk's thread, Spock's stakes are much higher for himself and his people, therefore we immediately gravitate towards him just like audiences did back in the 60s. That's one thing this film got right, it wisely focused emotional heft on the franchise's mascot.Another thing the film got right is it divided it's focus on some choice side characters, the most prominent of which is fellow marooned starfarer Jaylah (Boutella). Trapped on Krall's inhospitable planet since childhood, Jaylah's resourcefulness and stubborn individualism channels the young Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone (2010). The moment she saves the shipwrecked Scotty (Pegg) from fellow scavengers, she immediately becomes the power source this film orbits and it's all the better for it.The theme of the day in Star Trek Beyond is unity. The unity of the Enterprise's crew is tested against the power of Krall and his army of drones who seems to know all about the Federation of Planets. Krall goes through great pains dismantling the morale of the imprisoned crew and Lieutenant Uhura in particular. "Unity is not your strength. It is a weakness," says Krall in a quick deconstruction of his plans. Yet his machinations for Star Fleet are conspicuously left out until a third act reveal that is reminiscent of Shinzon's character arc in Star Trek: Nemesis (2002). Not only that, he's a surprisingly layered foil to the equally embittered Jaylah who's been alone for so long she has no concept of unity.In it's entirety, this film is not Beyond certain genre limitations. While scribes Simon Pegg and Doug Jung channel the original germ in the screenplay, the film still feels like it's in the wrong tempo leaving too little in the film's quieter moments while racing towards the next action set-piece. Visually the film sneaks in a few literate allusions (not to mention references to other parts of the Star Trek universe) yet Lin's showy camera-work proves distracting, especially when he hammers home the "what's up is down" motif.Beyond may not be the "return" of Star Trek's brand of unapologetic, cerebral sci-fi. That torch has been passed to Doctor Who (2005- Present) quite a while ago. Judged purely by the movies, Star Trek Beyond is somewhere between The Voyage Home (1986) and First Contact (1996). As a contemporary action film/sci-fi space adventure it's arguably among the best you'll see this year.

<Movie title is Into the Woods>

I saw Into the Woods yesterday at a previewing of it at Harkins Theater. It is definitely a MUST see! The casting was done extremely well for almost all the characters. Not only this but their choices of set and scenery for each scene in the movie was done exceptionally well. This movie has many amazing things about it! I'd say if I had to choose one thing specifically out of everything i liked about it, I'd say the emotional atmosphere the movie creates. This emotional atmosphere keeps you on the edge of your sit,it also makes you feel sympathy for each character and their individual stories.But I am not just going to say something about the atmosphere the movie creates but how great the music itself was. There are several songs in Into The Woods that I left the Theater with on my mind.I guarantee when if you go see Into The Woods you'll leave the Theater satisfied.So go and see Into the Woods when it comes out in Theaters Christmas day!

I'm going to preface this by stating that I am completely unfamiliar with the source material. I've never seen the stage version of James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim's musical, never heard the songs before, and I had no idea what the story was about. I do, however, enjoy movie musicals. In fact, Rob Marshall's adaptation of "Chicago" is one of my all time favorites. Now to this film...The songs, cast, direction, cinematography, and production design are all top-notch. Obviously, you want good music in a musical, and Mr. Sondheim doesn't disappoint. Rob Marshall clearly knows what he's doing by now, as he expertly captures the actors performances, with camera work that sweeps you off your feet. I'm no expert on singing, but everyone in the cast seemed to be bringing their A game. The only performance I didn't really care for was Johnny Depp's, but thankfully he's only around for about one song.For the first two-thirds of this movie, I was having a great time. The intersecting stories were interesting, the characters were fun, the (often dark) comedy was hilarious. Then came the third act.This is where, I assume, the second act in the stage version begins. But what would probably make sense for the second half of a live musical, is instead jammed into the last 30 minutes of the film version. Usually in films, the third act is where all of the conflicts, character motivations - everything that has been building up over the first two acts, comes to a head. Instead, Into the Woods resolves all of the conflicts by the end of act two, and then starts over with new ones in act three. We're now effectively watching a new movie.This might not be as big an issue if the pacing didn't come to a crawl in the final act. There seem to be less songs, and the few there are end up slowing down the story, instead of driving it. Characters that were stomping through the woods with purpose, now seem to be wandering aimlessly, bumping into other characters for more contrived conflict. Nothing feels organic or fresh anymore, and by the end I was just thankful the damn movie was over.I realize that fans of the stage version will probably like this film a lot more than I did. They'll probably "get" the story's unusual ending, because they are aware of the original creator's intentions. But I can only judge this film based on its own merits. And on its own, it is not very good.

I knew of the play and the storyline, but was not familiar with the music until I actually heard it. Some great songs! The cast was all able to carry the tunes without looking bad...very impressed. For the younger viewer...little ones...I'm not sure this is a film for them. Main reason being I'm not sure they get read these fairy tales anymore. My grandkids like Star Wars, Frozen etc. I think 10 and up will enjoy the story at different levels. Younger than teens will like the two kids Jack and Little Red Riding Hood...both well cast with good voices as well. Teens will like the pg rated sexual tensions and story lines there. Older will like the music, sets, acting and visual effects in the film. Also like many Disney films the younger will interpret the line one way while the older will understand it differently..more adult. Meryl Streep and the rest of the actors did a great job with their roles. A nice film for the holidays.

"Into the Woods" felt like a story told in 17 acts. As the movie went on, you could feel the life draining from your body. But it was not going to be a painless death; with each added scene, it became more excruciating. The music was unDisney-like in that it was not catchy, it was preachy. In the end the remaining villagers are running from a giant woman who looked a lot like Eleanor Roosevelt. She knocked down trees and buildings with her giant feet. She was trying to avenge the death of another giant. I began to pray that her giant foot would turn the cast into toe jam. Then, they would stop that infernal singing.Bad Disney, really bad Disney.

Well, i had a lot of excitement and hopes for this movie. Who could not? Here it has a dream cast, a compilation of fairy tale characters, an innovative touch as a musical, and Johnny Depp. Any ways. It was the movie's world premier in DIFF, and we dressed up with my wife; you know, bow ties, dress clothes etc. At the end we were going to the world premier of one of the movies we had been expecting. And what happened? Well, i can say a lot of things happened, but not a single nice thing about this movie. It was bad bad bad. The flow was bad, the musical quality was horrible, the characters were not fitting, even it was not possible to place this movie in any genre - was it comedy? No. Fantasy, no. Family, No No. What was that? I guess it was a too-long-cut movie version of Once-Upon-a- Time TV series WANNABE. Don't go. Don't waste your time and money. Into the wooooood la la la la... KIll meeee, kill meee now...

Seriously wasn't there any better looking girl for Cinderalla role who can sing in entire Hollywood? I want the Prince go with the witch, well almost! Comparing her with Emily Blunt makes it worse! I am not against Anna Kendrick but I don't think she was cut as Cinderalla...she is talented, has a nice voice but I am sure had this been real, Cinderalla Anne would have waited her prince Chris charming forever. Chris Pine is the prince as you can imagine him as a prince. Unfortunately, the best make up that turn wonderful Meryl Streep into a witch couldn't do much for Miss Kendricks. I thought she could be one of the sisters, but not Cinderella...oh no!

Slick, lavish, and imaginatively vibrant, Rob Marshall's newest musical adaptation "Into the Woods" hits most of the notes as a thoroughly entertaining experience of the holiday season. Assembling one the year's finest casts, Marshall brings his ability to bring each actor to their utmost potential, while keeping composer Stephen Sondheim's brilliance intact. In the end however, the real problem with "Woods" is that its narrative structure is slashed like a hairstylist that took too much off the top, or in this case the second act. The first hour of James Lapine's adaptation is so wholesomely fulfilling. When the story takes a sudden, yet awkward shift into "serious" and more adult territory, this Disney produced spectacle struggles to find its footing. Perhaps, a director's cut, 30 minutes longer, and more clearly obvious themes would have felt more satisfying. This doesn't take away from the marvelous performances that are abound. Those will surely keep you engaged enough to make it through.It's imperative to begin with Chris Pine. A movie star that hasn't been afforded the opportunity to stretch his acting legs beyond "Star Trek" and "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit." When you look at the definition of having fun in a role, Pine's face will be planted firmly next to the words. A career best performance with the show's best musical number, "Agony." Try to look at him the same way after this. A true standout, and scene stealer. Go figure by the way, the man has a very impressive set of pipes.The Queen of the Academy, three-time Oscar-winner Meryl Streep is the best she's been since "The Devil Wears Prada." Seeing Streep operate in these later years, especially stage adaptations like "Doubt," "Mamma Mia!," and last year's "August: Osage County," have not brought out the greatness that Streep is capable of achieving. Granted, anything that is "lower-tier Meryl" is probably better than most, but I've ached to see her hit another home run. This is it. Streep's work as the Witch is profoundly moving and beautifully orchestrated. "Stay with Me" and especially "Last Midnight" will reaffirm her place in our cinematic lives. One of the best performances of the year.The gorgeous and vivacious Emily Blunt is everything you've come to expect from her at this point in her career. She's an amazing performer, beautiful singer, and knows how to elevate material, even when it clearly begins to bog her down. There's nothing wrong with the way that Blunt interprets the Baker's Wife. She's desperate, eager, and extremely hyperactive to get what she wants. In the latter part of the script, a controversial choice could have ignited talk and tears however, because there's clearly chops throughout the narrative, the Baker's Wife's role ultimately feels non-fulfilling for the audience. That doesn't take away from Blunt's talents. She's simply terrific.In what clearly is designed to be the heart and soul of "Into the Woods," James Corden's work as the Baker will propel him into a household name (especially with his upcoming takeover for Craig Ferguson). He's funny, tender, and just a joy to watch. He's a throwback to John C. Reilly's Oscar-nominated work in "Chicago." Affecting, expressive, and memorable. In a story full of characters you grew up loving, making terrible life choices, you find yourself rooting for someone to come on the other side alive, intact, and sustained. For many, Corden will be that character. He's the real deal. I can't wait to see him in more challenging and daring roles in the future."Up in the Air" gave us Anna Kendrick, well at least to the high- brow film community. One Academy Award nomination later, she has mostly succeeded in her own vehicles like "Pitch Perfect" and the upcoming "The Last 5 Years," at least based on early word. Playing Cinderella is a daunting task. Anyone who has it will have to compete with mental images from the animated classic, and any other live action interpretation you've seen throughout your life. Kendrick has the physical prowess and charisma to do all Cinderella's assets justice however, there's something that ultimately feels off. While her co- star Pine disappears into the role of the Prince with no semblance of his former character interpretations, Kendrick just doesn't disguise herself enough to warrant a 100% golden star, or in this case a shoe. For her number "On the Steps of the Palace," she nearly hits her stride. Just not exactly what we hoped for.The rest of the cast has their individual moments. Johnny Depp's interpretation of the Wolf was fun, but anyone who had a problem with his vocal range in "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," will have their lickings once again. I'm glad that I've learned who Billy Magnussen is now as a result of his work as Rapunzel's Prince. He's delightful. Mackenzie Mauzy's Rapunzel is an unrealized staple of the musical that could have been far more richer and satisfying than what was ultimately displayed. Mauzy's turn is essential.Christine Baranski's work as the wicked Stepmother kicks off the film on the most enormous high. A delectable presence sprinkled throughout. Same for the brilliant Tracey Ullman who just needs to be in more movies these days. The young performers, Daniel Huttlestone as Jack and Lilla Crawford as Red Riding Hood are equal parts impressive and annoying. The step-sisters, Lucy Punch and Tammy Blanchard are finely tuned with their wicked counterpart throughout."Into the Woods" is an energetic, rapturous romp at the movies. Lovely displayed with stunning production work and costume design, which are both singular standouts of the film year. Managed, genuine, and appreciated, "Into the Woods" is a must-watch for the season. An alluring, though flawed work, that stands as an excuse and reason to keep the movie musical alive. If anything, above all else, you take that with you to the bank.Read more @ (www.awardscircuit.com)

I was a huge fan of the original Broadway musical and when I found out that they were making a film version of this beloved Sondheim/Lapine-musical, I was crazy excited. I'm not going to critically analyze this film because I know you already know that with this A-team cast and creative team, the film is going to be spectacular. I'll just clear up some confusions and mild criticisms. First of all, I agree with most reviews that the latter half of the film felt off, especially for those who aren't familiar with the source material. This is most likely due to their decision of cutting The Narrator character from the stage musical. The death of the narrator was an essential turning point in the musical; he's supposed to be the one guiding the characters in their story, but after he died, things went wrong (like the Prince's affair with Baker's Wife and the Giantess thing). Also, I was disappointed that the show's act finale/opener, Ever After and So Happy were cut, although I get it due to cinematic restrictions. Ever After and So Happy juxtaposes the two acts, whilst expressing the characters' perception and doubts of a happy ending. I was also saddened that many viewers (and reviewers) didn't found Sondheim's songs as astounding, lacking the "catchy" factor, which they also found in the film version of Sweeney Todd. While it's understood that Sondheim's labyrinthine score isn't for the general film audience, the genius of his music and lyrics is incomparable and deserves more commendations that it will never get from film adaptations of his films. That being said, Into the Woods is an overall fun and spectacular film (clearly a contender for the upcoming awards season), but like I said. It's better left onstage.

Greetings again from the darkness. It's a musical, but not a typical musical. It's a fairy tale, but not a typical fairy tale. It's funny, but not a typical comedy. It's a bit frightening, but not a typical monster film. It's filled with lessons of morality and responsibility, but certainly not a typical parable. In fact, there is nothing typical about director Rob Marshall's (Oscar winner for Chicago) screen adaptation of the smash Broadway hit from Stephen Sondheim and James Lupine.The story revolves around 4 classic Fairy Tales: Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, and Cinderella, in a style much more similar in tone to the edgy Brothers Grimm, than the cuddly Walt Disney traditionals. These four are intertwined with the saga of a baker (James Cordon) and his wife (Emily Blunt) who discover they have been unable to have children due to a long ago spell cast by a wicked witch (Meryl Streep). With a secret agenda, the witch offers the couple a way to break the spell, and that's what ties-in the four tales and provides a reason for adventure and song.Filmed seamlessly between an elaborate sound stage and a couple of park locations, the film has a dark and eerie feel to it that's probably too intense for younger children. And much of the dialogue and lyrics is aimed directly at adults and will be a blur to kids. Additionally, in typical Sondheim fashion, the songs aren't catchy and melodic in the manner of most movie musicals  instead the lyrics propel the story and help shape the characters. Oh, and by the way, don't expect any fancy dance sequences – this is pretty serious stuff with plenty of angst amongst the characters.Ms. Streep is extraordinary as the witch (both nasty and beautiful) and does a terrific job with her three main songs. She is especially fun in her entrances and exits, and while wearing the most impactful of all the costumes. Emily Blunt also handles her vocals very well and offers up some of the film's most witty dialogue. Chris Pine (as the Prince) is flat out hilarious, and with a twinkle in his eye, spouts lines such as "I was raised to be charming, not sincere". He also shares the screen with Billy Magnussen (playing the younger brother) in the most audacious of the musical numbers, "Agony". As Cinderella, Anna Kendrick once again proves she is an exceptionally talented singer, and James Cordon anchors the production as the nice guy village baker we are rooting for.In supporting roles, we have a devilish Johnny Depp whose screen time as the Big Bad Wolf is quite limited, and a perfectly cast Christine Baranski as the evil step-mother in cahoots with her non-Cinderella daughters played by Lucy Punch and Tammy Blanchard. Lilla Crawford is Little Red Riding Hood, and her young age snuffs out much of the innuendo that the Wolf scenes should have provided, and takes the edge off the song "I Know Things Now". Daniel Huddlestone is an energetic Jack, and dependable Tracey Ullman plays his frustrated mom. MacKenzie Mauzy captures the awakening of Rapunzel, while Frances de la Tour frightens everyone involved as the agitated (for good reason) Lady Giant.Unconventional is the best description of this production, and there is a group of viewers who will be totally captivated by it, while a much larger group will probably find it too dark and bleak, and lacking the easy charm we have come to expect from movie musicals. However, for those of us in the first group, we will be totally enchanted by the characters, story lines, wry humor, costumes, sets, and songs.

"I was raised to be charming, not sincere." Cinderella's Prince (Chris Pine)That quote pretty much sums up the mash up of fairy tales called Into the Woods. The familiar characters are there like Rapunzel, Witch, Little Red Riding Hood, Bad Wolf, Jack of the Beanstalk. Yet as in the quote, not all are as we remember them—their wishes that have come true have changed them just as the woods have given them a chance to be someone other than the heroes we made.Stephen Sondheim created this amalgam of famous fables and let the woods help them become real like the rest of us. Because this is a Disney product, it begins with each character wishing for something each did not have. Writer James Lapine and director Rob Marshall proceed in a glorious collection of songs to show how you may get what you wish for, lamentably. They are helped by Dennis Gassner's near perfect English countryside production design, which can make you feel imprisoned even in the expansive woods.The evil engine of this hodge-podge is the witch next door (Meryl Streep), who demands the barren Baker's wife (Emily Blunt) and her husband (James Corden) fetch some objects like gold hair and slippers, among others, if they wish to have a child. While this witch has a sardonic side (quite amusing at times), she still rules with the kind of power that can raise cows from the dead! Because Streep knows how to deliver menace and irony in the same breath, her Oscar nomination is well deserved. Not that she doesn't have enough already.Anyway, Into the Woods is true to its themes, carrying wish fulfillment to its right conclusion and with it a lesson learned about being happy with what you have. A leitmotif about the demands of parenthood and the intense love necessary to keep the family going is also powerful—embodied in the Bakers and beanstalk Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) and his mom (Tracey Ullman). Accompanied by first-rate songs, filmed musicals don't get much better."Some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again." C.S. Lewis

This was probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. EVER. Please, don't waste your time and/or money on this movie, as it was awful. The movie started off cute, with the music and the setting and all. But then the music turned into this preachy, do the right thing, "listen to your elders" movie. It was awful. 30minutes into it, I knew it wasn't going to get any better. This movie felt like a mash-up of a terrible version of Les Mis and Once Upon A Time. The music almost never ceased and I was just about to throw my remote at the TV. Not worth a penny. If I was the creator of this movie, I would never show my face again. To anyone giving this movie higher than a 4 star review is crazy, and most likely getting paid for their good review. This movie should receive a million Raspberry awards. PLUS, 99% OF THE PEOPLE DIED. TERRIBLE ENDING. Don't watch, this movie has literally no genre. This movie is probably as much for little kids as Les Mis is. I couldn't even understand half of the words they were singing. The only good part about this movie is Lilla Crawford. I have seen her in Annie and she is great. But the part with Johnny Depp was TERRIBLE and the part with his "stomach" is so cheesy that I think a 5 year old could have done better effects on it. This movie was a waste of my time, and frankly, a waste of my LIFE.

My Thoughts: First and foremost, this is a musical, people. I know there are some people that hate musicals, so I am giving you fair warning. I remember coming out of a screening of Rock of Ages and overhearing someone say "I didn't know it was a musical!" I just shook my head and kept walking.Second, if you are going to this movie and are expecting to see period-type garb, do not go–you will be disappointed. You ask me why I bring this up? I have friends that do look at the costumes that are worn by the actors and will critique them. I say this again because there are some costumes that are over-the-top, but this is based on fairy tales.I will come right out and say it: two-thirds of this movie is good, then we go come to the third act. I am serious when I say that there were people that got up and started walking out of the screening because they thought that the movie was over. There is a point in the movie that warps up everything nicely and "happily ever after," and then it keeps going and gets darker, slower, and weaker. And all the time I kept thinking are we done yet?The best part of the movie? No, it wasn't Emily Blunt or Anna Kendrick, and that is very hard for me to say; people that know me will understand. But the best part is the scene with Cinderella's Prince (Chris Pine) and Rapunzel' Prince (Billy Magnussen) they have one song that I swear to god had the theater in stitches (Jen's note: it's "Agony"); and their acting was just great. I think I could have watched that scene over and over. If you go see the movie you will know what I am talking about, and I hope you come back and let me know if I was right.And let me tell you this movie goes from musical, to fairy tale, to dark tale, to comedy, etc. I don't mind the darkness; many people don't know that the old fairy tales weren't all happily ever after.Also, I don't know what the budget was on this movie, but everyone seemed to be in it, and I mean everyone. I feel sorry for Lucy Punch; she seems to get typed cast as the evil step sister; I swear she was playing the same role in Ella Enchanted. Oh, Meryl Steep did an outstanding job as The Witch; if you need someone to play that evil, corrupted character, then you should cast her.I guess I should talk on the music in this since it is a musical. There are some great pieces in here that had me getting into the music, then there are pieces that just fall flat and you wish they would hurry it up and get over it.So, if I could just pay to go to the first two-thirds of this movie I would love it, but include the last third, and eh!My Recommendation: Catch a matinée.

When I heard back in 2013 that an adaptation of Steven Sondheim's classic musical Into the Woods was being made into a film, I felt apprehensive. I've never been the biggest fan of lead actress Meryl Streep or director Rob Marshall; I worried about how Emily Blunt, Anna Kendrick, and Chris Pine would fare in the singing department (I had fears of another Mamma Mia! Pierce Brosnan debacle), and any confidence I had left in Johnny Depp was pretty much wiped out when I viewed his latest cinematic duds The Lone Ranger (2013) and Transcedence (2014). Most of all, I was afraid that Disney would try and omit the dark humor and more adult- oriented themes and songs present in Sondheim's musical in favor of more child-friendly slapstick. Thankfully, Marshall and Co. have managed to keep the spirit of the musical and the Brothers' Grimm fairy tales intact, and despite a few spotty CGI effects and a third act that feels a bit rushed (sort of like the musical), the performances are all well done, many of the songs are well performed and choreographed, and overall, the film is quite enjoyable to watch.The plot of Into the Woods (2014) is actually several different Grimm fairy tales, which include "Rapunzel", "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Cinderella", and "Little Red Riding Hood", all interweaving with a central plot about the Baker and the Baker's Wife (James Cordon and Emily Blunt), a couple who seek to end their curse of being childless, which was placed upon them by the Witch (Meryl Streep). The Witch offers them a chance to bear a child if they can collect several items; these items in turn are all related to the other fairy tale characters.Almost all of the actors are excellent in their roles, and surprisingly, their singing is pretty good. Meryl Streep carries the movie, and unlike Mamma Mia! (2008), her singing doesn't feel cheesy or forced. Also, her makeup and prosthetics are top notch, and really proves why ugly witches are still the best in movies. Blunt and Cordon are quite good in their roles, and have a fair share of funny moments. Anna Kendrick and Mackenzie Mauzie are adequate as Cinderella and Rapunzel, but ultimately their characters feel a little underdeveloped. Chris Pine is surprisingly excellent as Cinderella's Prince, and his duet "Agony" with Billy Magnussen as Rapunzel's Prince is easily my favorite moment in the film. Surprisingly, Johnny Depp is decent as the Wolf, and his scenes with Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) manage to keep their dark and humorous themes intact. Finally, Daniel Huttlestone does a great job as Jack, reminding me once again why I felt he gave one of the best performances in Les Miserables (2012).As I mentioned in the introduction, I did feel that the last third of the film feels pretty rushed, and like the musical, it feels like a section that was added just to turn what is supposed to be a happy ending, into a bittersweet one. Also, while most of the sets and costumes (yes, even the Wolf) are excellent, some exterior CGI shots like the beanstalk, and the Princes' castle didn't look very good, which is disappointing knowing the rest of the effects and sets are of such a high quality. Overall, Into the Woods is an adaptation, unlike recent films Jersey Boys and Annie (2014), that mostly works. The songs are catchy, the choreography is well done, and the the performances are consistently funny. With the exception of a lackluster final act, this is probably the best adaptation of Sondheim's musical that we could possibly get, and I commend Marshall and Co. for their work.Final Verdict: 7/10

I've seen it three times and want to see it more!In Into the Woods, Disney pours its dark magic potions and talents to bring us an interesting and very creative mixture of the traditional fairy tales. This is not just a musical. It's a cautionary tale, a fable. It's beautiful but it also has bits of horror.I love how several story-lines converge into one--making the whole even more complex and exciting. I also love the surprise factor, most of the time I had no idea what was coming next! Good! The first part of the movie is colorful and is headed to a happy ending, hence the fairy tale part. Then suddenly, things fall apart and it turns gray. Hence, the cautionary part. The story begins with our main characters making bad choices, and these bad choices carry out through the entire movie until it unravels into tragedies. But in the end, our characters have grown--they accept the consequences of their bad choices and build themselves a new life. I think it is entertaining, innovative, exciting, and it will take you to another world. Will it inspire you? It depends. It depends how you interpret the message of the story. The special effects are beautiful, the spectacle is enjoyable – the scenery and staging are captivating. The songs and the singing are wonderful. I enjoyed all that. In general the acting was great. The children give great performances. Chris Pine is gorgeous – definitely prince charming but not necessarily prince goodness. Meryl Streep impersonates a fantastic witch— she is super wicked and she manipulates and takes advantage of the desperate couple to get what she wants. Emily Blunt is brilliant, I wish we could have seen her character succeed in some way by the end of the movie. Johnny Depp makes a fantastic man-wolf that feels more like a child-predator. Pretty scary! A man after a little girl Again, here we see the raw cautionary tale in action. The movie has several messages and warnings. The strongest point: beware of your wishes. Don't let your wishing get on the way of common-sense and virtue and good-will. Don't let your wishes throw you into darkness, because darkness will make you lose yourself and drag others with you. Don't be greedy. Don't be desperate. My 10-year old daughter doesn't want to watch it again. Perhaps is a more appropriate movie for older children. Overall, it's definitely a movie that will entertain you and make you dream and make you think. Please watch it!Enjoy.Thanks for reading. Cheers.

I wish it ended about a half hour sooner. At that point there was a Hollywood fairy tale ending. The last thirty minutes turns very dark. By the end nearly every mother is dead.Great award worthy performances. Meryl Streep gives a scary good performance. Johnny Deep makes a good bad wolf. Emily Blunt shines. Outstanding Art Direction, sets, sound and editing make this movie work.It is a magical marvelous musical that goes off the rails. It is way too intense for younger children. See it in a theater with a big screen and big sound.

Meryl Streep's performance was top notch as usual, and the 30 seconds Johnny Depp was on the screen were the highlight of the movie, the rest of it was abysmal. Storyline is a completely meaningless conglomerate of dozens of fairy- tales that defies the impossible and deteriorates with each minute. Such a huge frustrating disappointment. BTW - if you still insist on watching this, at least don't take your kids to see it. At first I thought it was just me - and so I made myself watch the thing till the end puzzling all the time why would someone invest time and money into producing this. As I was finally (!!) exiting the theater someone nearby summed his experience as "two hours of torture".

For context, I have not seen the stage musical in years. Roughly 10 years ago (I think?) I watched a high school stage version, so that's not an ideal comparison anyway. Basically, I knew the general story and a few of the songs, but that's all I had going into this movie.And I loved it. The casting was great, I didn't disagree with any of their choices. I was slightly skeptical of Chris Pine beforehand--I love the man, but I was afraid they put him in just because he's a popular hot-guy actor right now. But once I truly remembered the character he portrays, I realized that it was a perfect choice. No acting issues, even the kids acted wonderfully. And I was very grateful that this didn't get modernized with a bunch of "inside jokes" or modern pop culture references like some things can.The singing was nearly perfect, in my opinion. There were a few weird parts, but I believe it was mostly from the children, so that's excusable. I already adored Sondheim's music, so I fully expected to love the songs. They kept all the songs I knew, and I don't know if anything was added or a song I didn't remember was taken out. Basically, all the "big" ones are there as far as I know.I walked out already waiting to see it again. I'll probably go again before it's out of theaters, and will definitely buy it the day it comes out on DVD.

There were a few exceptionally good moments, the 2 princes singing together was one of the best, but in the end it got too generic. There were good lines, good acting, and good cgi, but it didn't come across that brilliantly. It got some applause from the audience but some yawns too. A bit too long, and the singing seemed like one long continuous tune after 2 hours. There weren't any tunes that will stick with you just kind of annoying sing song rhymes. Finally the ending was "meh". I mostly enjoyed the concept of combining all the fairy tales and some of the black humor (eyes being pecked out by Cindrella's pet birds). It was hard to care much about any of the characters, they were all muddled as very human and flawed. On the whole it was taking fairy tales and making them modern parables about people not being careful for what they wished.

When I think "Sondheim musical" I do not include "West Side Story" or "Gypsy" even though he had a hand in them. But when one thinks of those films, it's the choreography (in the former) and the music (in the latter) that come to mind. No, the true "Sondheim musical" genre begins with "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" and continues (with a detour for "Do I Hear a Waltz?") to the present day.Precious few of Sondheim's shows have made the transition to film. Aside from the previously-mentioned "Forum" we have "A Little Night Music" and "Sweeney Todd," all of which have major flaws. I don't include filmed stage productions such as "Passion" and "Sweeney Todd" as these are sui generis. Alas, "Anyone Can Whistle," "Company," "Follies," Merrily We Roll Along," "Pacific Overtures," and "Assassins" have never been given full film treatments.When I heard that Disney was producing the film "Into the Woods" I was very apprehensive, fearing that the studio would sanitize it beyond all recognition. Thankfully, that is not the case. Disney and Rob Marshall have gathered a creditable cast of genuine singing actors. Yes, a few minor changes to the stage show have been made and a couple of songs have been changed or omitted, but considering Hollywood's track record with adaptations of Broadway musicals, the film is very faithful to the source material.Emily Blunt is rapidly becoming my favorite current film actress. Here she is the heart and soul of the story, along with the, to me, hitherto unnoticed James Corden. Meryl Streep is her usual sterling self as the witch. Bernadette Peters set a high standard on stage, but Streep makes the role her own. Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen are marvelous in their "Agony" duet, each out-posturing the other in macho bravado. Tracey Ullman was a very pleasant surprise as the mother of Jack, ably played by Daniel Huttlestone. Lilla Crawford is fine, although she's a bit too young to put across the sexual awakening that Little Red Riding Hood experiences after encountering the Big Bad Wolf (an all-too-briefly seen Johnny Depp). Perhaps that may have been part of the Disney-fication of the show.It's truly gratifying to have seen such a magnificent treatment of what may be becoming Sondheim's most popular musical. I loved it!

First of all, I'm a guy who enjoys watching Disney movies (Who don't?) with my nieces and nephews or even alone sometimes. Disney has always found its way into our hearts and rooted there, with its beautifully told stories and stunning visuals.Last year, I thought 'Frozen' was an exceptionally exhilarating experience in terms of musical genre movies. I don't quite fancy this genre really, but the filmmakers and the whole music department have done a great job showing how appealing a good musical movie can be. The Oscar winning 'Let it go' by Idina Menzel was nothing less than a masterpiece.Now speaking of 'Into the woods', it was the exact opposite. The music was lame, the characters as well. Not even a single character delivered a genuine performance. The word 'poor' is too generous to describe the script and the acting, though there are many fairy tales in this movie that we grew up loving. It was so bad that I couldn't stop fidgeting the whole time.Maybe the only reason I give it 3 stars is because of Meryl Streep. It is always good to see her. Unfortunately, this could be the only movie that I watched for her and she did not excel in.One last advice, if you really want to spend a good time with your kids, take them to the park or just do anything else entertaining. If you would rather watch a movie with them, avoid this one.

Into The Woods (2014) isn't a reimagining of Steven Sondheim's musical -- instead, it's a mostly faithful transposition of the stage production onto the big screen (blessedly shortening the 2nd act). In that respect, it's a triumph of reasonably careful casting and a restrained use of special effects. The actors, most of whom have singing parts, acquit themselves very well (the baker less so in terms of singing). Certain pacing problems arise naturally from the approach taken: Everyone wants to clap after the many musical numbers. The flow stops after each song, breaking the continuity and giving the movie an unnatural pace. This was especially true after the Princes' big number -- clapping burst out spontaneously (and deservedly). Some musical numbers seemed to lack Sondheim's dark intent, in particular the Witch's "Last Midnight" where someone in the audience actually laughed afterwards. Ouch. And if you haven't gotten the message from other reviews, let's just say this isn't your typical end to a Disney movie. I suggest this movie is inappropriate for anyone under 12/13. Sondheim's mature themes won't play well with the little ones. // That said, I still give this 8 / 10 for a very good rendition of the stage production. If you like this 2014 version and haven't seen the 1997 filmed version with Bernadette Peters and Johanna Gleeson, you owe it to yourself to check it out.

I love musicals. I especially love Disney musicals. I really do. I just could have done with a little less singing and more speaking. It is music from start to end which I know to many isn't a bad thing but for my attention it was. I enjoyed most of the songs but others are right, I am a Disney fan that wanted some more dancing and a few happy endings wouldn't have killed anyone (literally). It was a beautiful movie visually but a little too long and a little too sad for my liking. It's Christmas! I wanted to leave the theater feeling happy and whimsical and light. I applaud Disney for sticking fairly close to some of the source material but wish I had realized that before I went to see it. Thinking back on the previews, they do seem a bit sad and so much of the blame is on me. I gave it a 7.

i absolutely loved this movie. I feel as though a lot of the reviews are horrible and that is because, NO ONE REALIZED IT WAS A MUSICAL BEFORE IT WAS A MOVIE!!!! Everyone is saying how dark it was, and yes it's dark because that's how the musical actually is!!! And some are even saying there is too much music. That's because it's a musical for goodness sakes. I loved it. It was cast well, and performed well. The ending is dark however, and I would not request this show for anyone under the age of 10, despite the PG rating. It was done very well and I was very happy with the outcome! If you enjoy musicals, or simply just a good movie, this is a great choice.

Okay, I did think that this movie had a few redeeming qualities, and a chuckle or two. Overall though, I regretted seeing it. It seemed like it was 100% singing, and while I do like some musicals, I like dialog mixed in. My wife and I both agreed that it also felt like the movie was about 30 minutes too long. Both of us were hoping it would end soon, during the last bit. I would have also rather them choose a different actress for Cinderella. Anna Kendrick is not very attractive, and I didn't find it believable with her in that role. I would have preferred to see her cast as the baker's wife, which would have much better suited for her.

This movie is an absolute disaster. If you are looking for good acting and comedy, you are not going to get it here. The movie is a terrible musical with a good cast that can't sing. It is meant to be funny but comes across as a mellow drama. If I were to describe this movie in one word it would be a horrendoma. A horrendoma is a medical term for a tumor that is unable to be cut out or destroyed in any other fashion, or a fatal disease or syndrome that cannot be cured. It is just absolutely horrible. The story line is repetitive and messy. It is confusing and goes back and forth between serious and funny. Lilla Crawford (Little Red Riding-Hood) and Daniel Huttlestone (Jack) came across as annoying and were not great singers. I, personally, could not take Anna Kendrick (Cinderella) and Chris Pine (Prince Charming) seriously due to their previous roles. The ones they played in this movie were unlike them.

Clearly people did not realize that this was a play first. This isn't some animated bubble gum pop Disney movie. And if that's what you are expecting then don't come. Watch the play from the 80's before you come see this so you understand what this movie is about. This adaption has a great cast and great music. The scenery is also impressive. If you're looking for something that actually has character you can get behind, than I encourage you to view this film. If you're looking for a singing dog or something...this isn't the movie for you. This isn't frozen or lion king. Just because Disney is in connection with it doesn't mean it's something you bring your 3 year old to. They would get bored. It's more of an adult thing and has a good view fr each character. It does jump around to characters. But it's to try and connect their stories together

This is the worst movie I have ever seen. What a waste of talented actors. The plot is all over the place, the music is boring and without melody. The sets had potential but are mostly dark throughout and void of light. Very little color throughout the movie. I hated this movie what a waste of time and money. I can't believe Disney signed off on this movie. You can't tell whether it's a fairy tale, comedy, a parody or something in between all these. The trailers out there are deceiving. The feel of the movie is completely different than those portrayed in the trailers. Some of the stories don't make sense and are left open ended. I can't think of anything good about this movie except that it includes extremely talented actors. Still not good enough to even watch at home. Don't waste your time or money. Did I mention the music and singing is horrible?

This is not a movie, it's a musical! I love musicals when they showcase memorable, well- written songs with strong vocal performances by talented singers. The major problem with "Into the Woods" is it has neither! I would call the Sondheim score more "ditties" than songs, they are long and un-melodic, and they all sound like the same "ditty". Most musicals I've seen have a spoken script that breaks up the singing, but this is non-stop singing from start to finish by actors who are not even average singers...not one would make it through auditions for "The Voice"! My eyes started to close after the first few scenes when I realized what we were in for. Scenes are almost all shot in the same setting - the dark woods - so no matter when I woke up, I was looking at pretty much the same thing. Acting-wise, Chris Pine as the Prince is the only actor who was able to escape from the role constrictions because his was the only truly humorous character. His song "Agony" was cute, but not worth the price of admission. James Corden as the Baker gets to show some heart and as Baker's wife, Emily Blunt is sadly miscast and cannot sing. The two kids who play Little Red Ridinghood and Jack (from the "Beanstalk") need more vocal coaching, and Meryl Streep as the Witch never finds her voice, despite trying many different ones to perform her vocals. On any day, especially Christmas Day, we deserve better, Hollywood!

Whew what a stinking mess. I thought Frozen was a mess but this film takes the cake.When you're dealing with multiple narratives that eventually intertwine, it can be quite a challenge to undertake. It can be done if the writers and directors really know what they're doing but unfortunately, in this case they don't. There are SO MANY things in the narrative of this film that make no sense and others that are so forced it's painful. For example: They use Cinderella leaving the Prince's ball over and over and over as an excuse to build sexual tension between the Prince and the Baker's Wife when they meet each time the Prince goes in search of Cinderella which later leads to a scene where the Prince seduces her and proves to be unfaithful to Cinderella just to expose that old trope of Disney princes being charming scumbags. It just doesn't make sense. First of all, why would Cinderella keep returning to the ball only to run from the Prince each time? And why the hell would the Baker's Wife cheat on her husband when they just had a kid AND bonded via musical number a few scenes earlier? And then to have the writers toss her out of the story all together was ridiculous. All just to drive home the moral at the end that despite the fact that all these characters lost a loved one, they can come together as individuals and form a family. There were a lot of things in this film that worked really well (or at least almost worked) like the concept of having two separate characters in two separate places singing the same song and harmonizing together, the acting (not singing) skills of James Corden, Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep, and the atmosphere/cinematography. Everything else in the film is excruciating. I honestly feel that, with a better script, this film could have been a fantasy epic if only they weren't breaking into song every five minutes. I mean honestly, if you've seen one generic musical you've seen them all. Characters randomly break into song to beat the audience over the head with their inner thoughts and feelings or to sing things they could easily just speak. In the right hands, this could have easily been a masterpiece and the beginning of a legendary saga of live-action Disney fantasy films. Instead we're left with an extremely mediocre musical that tries to do way too many things all at once and doesn't know how to handle a single one of them.

This was the biggest waste of time and honestly a massive disappointment. Seriously, that's all I can say. I have never written a movie review before, however walking out of this movie I have never felt so inclined to express my utter disappointment. Filling 10 lines with how awful this movie was, is simply a painful recollection starting 5 minutes in. The sinning by most actors was not pleasant, not to mention the actual lyrics became annoying. I do enjoy a good musical, which has thoughtful and creative sense behind the lyrics. This, simply did not. Anticipating the next song mixed through dialog with failed attempts of humor was less than enjoyable. I can honestly say that I cringed when the movie did not end at the wedding of Cinderella and the prince. It was so close to "happily ever..." but was then cut short and we had to endure an additional 50+ minutes of nonsense. This is not a movie that I would recommend to anyone. I would score it a zero if I could.

I was expecting this film to be mediocre, it was far from it and the experience was magically adventurously mesmerizing. Meryl Streep was fantastic as usual, but Emily Blunt was so good and how about James Corden. People in the audience were complaining about too much singing...how about you realize it's based off a "musical" and go watch Les Miserables, you'll get way more singing.The story telling was so amazing and I felt like a kid again watching all this fairy tales come to life all together.Ignore every person who complains about the morals or Meryl Streep's character or the singing. This was a great film to watch on Christmas and it made my holidays that much better along with gems like Unbroken,Big Eyes,American Sniper and yes The Interview. Into The Woods is definitely a film to remember and is memorable with every song.

The movie was horrible, some of the acting was really bad. The whole movie is a long song ugh i couldn't wait to get out of the theatre. I hated when the "little red riding hood" simply says my grandmother is going to skin the wolf and make a cape for me out of his skin!! Seriously?! This movie was a waste of my time & money. Even my little 9 year old cousin thought the movie was; and i quote "kinda boring". There are lots of parts that don't fit the original stories, and not in a good way. I will say the witch was played very well. But i just can't get over being tricked into watching a 2 hour musical. When, in none of the commercials was it indicated or implyed that it was a musical.

There's so much to describe regarding 'Into the Woods.' Since it's one of the works of Stephen Sondheim that was written back in the 1980s as a stage production, I was already intrigued on what the Disney film adaptation would be like. Director Rob Marshall did a fine job leading this ensemble cast to how we the audience expect them to be seen as on film. It's a musical that isn't sugarcoated with stereotypical, elementary-level Disney music traits (i.e. breaking into both song and dance), instead it had more mature elements that raises the bar in terms of content, including angst that is channeled well into the musical numbers. Not since 2002's Chicago has he ever arranged a musical in the most vibrant of ways. I understood that some changes and omissions had to be done to make it family-friendly and nothing TOO adult, but nevertheless I was focused and willing to see everything play out.Basically, it all begins when a baker and his wife are confronted by a witch to collect certain items for their wish to be granted and having an old family curse lifted. At the same time, other fairy tale characters in the likes of Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, and even Rapunzel have their own stories played out. Eventually, their lives collide through both success and ultimately consequence.The entire cast performed really well with the most interesting of songs as well as some wittiness in a few of them. What captured my attention was young star Daniel Huttlestone as he really stepped up his game following off his success in the 2012 film Les Miserables with both spunk and cleverness. Johnny Depp was a real trickster as the Big Bad Wolf and is very reminiscent of the sly, Zoot suit-wearing, wolf from old 1940s Tex Avery cartoons. Depp's past involvement with Stephen Sondheim in 2007 as Sweeney Todd was a real show-stopper from beginning to end, but I felt that his role in this musical was petty, even if the early previews credit him alongside the main cast. He deserved more credit than that (albeit a short one), but I understand what the Wolf's fate would be like as in the original story.With an abundance of positive buzz going about through various critic reviews, I can see why award season will not ignore it in the least. It had drama, humor, and a hint of suspense that I was left bewildered and in awe. The first and second acts of the entire movie kept me focus since the songs used were rather enchanting, but as the third act started rolling in, I expected much more out of it than what was shown on screen. Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep were incredible, but Anna Kendrick should also have the same amount of recognition for her exceptional performance. Her portrayal as Cinderella was something of a kindred spirit who wants nothing but the best for her own happy ending like the others. I kind of liked how these fairy tale characters crossed over to help each other out, even with all the trouble they've endured in their own lives to begin with. Given its dark nature and adult situations, the movie as a whole remained faithful to the original production. Sure it has its imperfections and content that felt a little too adult for a PG rating (not to mention Rapunzel's story could've expanded further), but my thoughts for a good moral of this entire musical is laid out like this: Although we may find our happy ending, it's how we handle it through both truth and consequence soon afterwards.

There isn't really much to say about this film. The visuals are stunning and it looks well put together..the only problem are the songs..not only to they not advance the plot of the movie through the song..they bring it to a grinding halt and basically ramble about the same lesson or the same event freezing the entire movie in its tracks and letting it fall over itself. When I was watching it at the theater I saw many people get up and leave towards the final 20-30 minutes of it from being fed up with the movie because it seems to drag on so long...the end never seems in sight. The concept of the movie is brilliant to entwine so many different stories but the execution was faulty..I know that a musical is supposed to be a slower pace and be about the singing and acting but this had something off about it for sure..definitely off. I'll list some of the things I liked about this movie. *Potential Spoilers ahead*Pros: Visuals are very striking and well done The beginning of each of the characters stories were well done and flowed nicely. The singing was exquisite, the cast is very talented.Cons: Songs were dragged on for too long and lacked a bigger purpose other than to repeat an event or message and slow the plot of the movie. (Major) The opening song seemed chaotic...it actually bored me from the start but that's just my own taste.Maybe I'm just not that into musicals. But this is my take on it.

This is an adaptation of a Broadway musical that didn't seem to work so well on Broadway so I'm not sure why they wanted to make it into a movie. That being said, if you're going to go ahead and spend millions of dollars on making it into a movie, why not fix some of the problems that existed in the play? Or adapt it in a very loose way and do something really different with it? It seems somewhat like shooting oneself in the foot. You make a sophisticated musical for adults out of children's stories or fairy tales? Who is the audience? And ultimately, what does it add up to? I'm confused. When all was said and done it was much too long and much too confused about what it was trying to be or say. Is it trying to be a comedy? There are some great funny moments like Christine Baranski's scene stealing bit and Meryl Streep's great it in it but that's not enough to call it a comedy. It needs to be really funny if it's going to be a comedy. If it's not a comedy then it is just not engaging. The mishmash of fairy tales doesn't really add up to anything. I like the music, but the script is merely workmanlike with a few good moments. That's not enough. I loved Meryl Streep and Christine Baranski but the rest of the cast was just okay with an overly expository script that dragged them down. It gets tedious. I went to see it with a group of 6 people. 4 fell asleep. Nuff said.

Not sure there are any spoilers this time but I always check that box just to be safe. Here's what I wrote my sister about this film: "Saw "Into the Woods" and hated the singing. It's almost all singing and except for one segment, all the songs aren't songs at all but irritating notes that don't relate, like some disgusting note salad." Sondheim is famous but he certainly didn't live up to his reputation in this one. It's just a jumble of notes. They don't turn into pretty tunes. Instead the melodies wander up and down the scale like some cat trotting back and forth on a piano. Having the actors give the lines without music would have been preferable, like actors doing soliloquies in Shakespeare. I can visualize them conveying a mood, the content and inflecting their voices to convince us of their roles and their emotions. Singing aimless notes JUST DID NOT WORK. None of these songs will make it onto the radio. None of them. The princes singing at the top of the waterfall might be the only exception. I don't know if their song was a lot better but because it had a pleasant melody, I practically passed out -- I was so relieved. I enjoyed the way the story kept on after the happy-ever-after but at the same time I was so angry at Sondheim by then I couldn't really appreciate it. Someone actually paid him to write that crap? I could have done better . . . . in my sleep.I do want to say something about Streep's character, the witch. Her song about loving her "daughter": and not wanting to lose her doesn't wash. She was nothing but Rapunzel's jailer. And the idea of protecting her was baloney. Real love is giving not depriving. Rather than wanting Rapunzel to be enriched by living and by experiencing successes, she wanted to keep her jailed like a pet bird. The sentimental song was just that -- a sentimental song and of course it had a very forgettable melody. The ultimate proof of her selfishness was to throw her into the swamp when it came out that she had a lover. She was truly a witch and got what she deserved. My question is if you're writing a musical, how can you keep a straight face when you give a selfish ugly person sweet loving lines to sing in a supposedly sincere "I Love You" type song. I mean wouldn't you realize it would make the audience vomit?

Johnny Depp has always been known to play weirdos or freaks on camera. 2014's Into the Woods is just another film catering to his fixation for such fodder. His role in "Woods" hightails the fictional Big Bad Wolf and he's on and off the screen faster than a speeding bullet. Does his five minutes of fame really matter though? Not so much. He's just another pawn in this hyperactive mess of a movie that feels more like a stage play than anything else. Characters break into song relentlessly bringing the two hour proceedings at times, to a screeching halt. As I attended a sold out, Christmas Day showing, I thought I should be waiting for riggers to dart across the stage. I also thought the curtains were going to go down after each act, and then I found myself yearning for muted applause from the audience. Oh and I was bored for most of the vehicle's running time. Bottom line: After seeing Into the Woods, I realized that musicals belong in the theater, not in popcorn- munching multiplexes. You won't get a more truer statement from me anywhere.Granted, this is a flick based on a musical by Stephen Sondheim (he adapted 2007's Sweeney Todd) and a book by James Lapine. Rob Marshall (he shot 2002's highly energized, Chicago) takes on the reins as director and he inconsistently tries to weave four fairy tales ("Little Red Riding Hood", "Cinderella", "Jack and the Beanstalk", and "Rapunzel") into something an audience can follow. Bully for that. He provides Into the Woods with a lush, dangerous look only to have his editor (Wyatt Smith) appear to be on holiday. Too many characters fade in and out, too many scenes don't gel from one to the next, and the songs all sound the same (I heard that's the case with most musicals so count me out on seeing any more of them in the future). In truth, this is a clusterfunk of gigantic proportions, a sort of sabotage on the part of the actors/actresses who truly give it their best effort (Meryl Streep as a witch, kills it and should get her umpteenth Academy Award nomination). They can all sing, they obviously can act, but their jumbled story lines are wasted upon us, the audience. Oh and the script forces everyone to say "into the woods" about a million times throughout. I guess this is catered to the ticket buyer who is not misconstrued by the film's title (ha-ha).Now with Into the Words almost becoming a virtual, continuous loop of characters breaking out into song, most of the pieces (examples would be "Prologue: Into the Woods", "It Takes Two", and "Magic Beans"), have the same refrain, the same rondo, and virtually the same stanza (musical terms that involve repetition). This became a nuisance. There was one sequence however, where the cast members exhibited impeccable timing and I was impressed to know how they actually pulled it off. If you take in a viewing and listen for the movement, "Your Fault", you'll know exactly what I mean.Regardless, this wannabe critical darling is almost too intense to harness a PG rating (what with the implied notion of people's toes getting amputated and evil birds attacking two woman causing them to go completely blind). And with its elaborate cast (including Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick, Emily Blunt, and Tracey Ullman), I expected Rob Marshall and crew to right the ship. Negatory. Into the Woods is out of bounds with its incoherency and choppy narrative. Halfway through it, I wanted to leave the theater to go home and have a stiff drink.Of note: When the final credits for "Woods" came up, I heard about ten to fifteen people clapping. My ten year old nephew who also attended the screening, asked why they were clapping. My sentiments exactly.

Don't listen to these mindless reviewers. This was my first Musical movie. At first it was weird seeing characters sing instead of speak but it slowly grew on me. Listen to the lyrics of the songs carefully. And honestly I loved it. Going in I thought it would be just another kids movie with slightly dark undertones like Maleficent. But 20 minutes into the movie I realized that this is more mature than anything Disney has produced. Don't expect mindless fairy tale action. Look for instances that mirror the real life. Its a very touching story. Though it has its flaws it was produced really well. The ending was pretty dark but satisfying. I feel sad for anyone who doesn't understand the movie. Just shows how dumb and mindless people can be.

As a fan of musical theatre, Into the Woods was a movie I had to see the second I heard that was being made. My expectations, as a fan of Sondheim, were very high. And Disney did not disappoint. Not one role in this film was miscast. Corden and Blunt were the perfect people to play the Baker and his wife. Lilla Crawford and Daniel Huttlestone were risky casting choices by Rob Marshall, but they both paid off. Anna Kendrick brought the heart of Cinderella to life and his singing was perfect. But my top 3 performances of the film are Meryl Streep, Chris Pine, and Johnny Depp. Though his role is more of a cameo than anything, Depp takes his short amount of screen time and puts it to good use. He plays it up as the Wolf to a point where I was laughing, even though I knew I shouldn't have been. He stalks, sings, eats, and dies all within 5 minutes of screen time and does it perfectly. Meryl Streep can put a golden touch on any movie she's in and this role was perfect for her. She was funny, dramatic and goes to the limit as the Witch. Her Oscar nomination for this movie is almost guaranteed. Chris Pine is one of the best performers in the movie. He hams it up as the Prince and it leaves you laughing at his "Agony" with Billy Magnussen. The second he and Billy Magnussen started taking off their shirts in the middle of the song, myself and the rest of the people at the screening I was at were in stitches from the hilarity of the two princes. The dark themes that were present in the musical are still there and they work. I know that a lot of people are leaving Into the Woods out of the race for Best Picture, but now that it's out, I think it's safe to say that there is a pretty good chance. Everyone in the cast plays there role perfectly and not one person is miscast. Rob Marshall's direction, while not as perfect as his direction of "Chicago", is great for the film. James Lapine's screenplay keeps the dark and adult themes of the Broadway show while also slightly sanitizing it for Disney. The make-up work is so impressive, it's a wonder how it got snubbed for the Oscar. The set and costume design are also perfect. There was serious effort in bringing the classic characters and the woods to life. If this films doesn't get any Oscar nods, I will lose all faith in the Academy.Altogether, after seeing the disappointing remake of Annie, it's good to see a musical adaptation without a single miscast actor, a group of amazing actors who can sing, and set and costume designs that are absolutely perfect. Congrats to Disney for giving us a fairy tale that doesn't end with "happily ever after" and was a fantastic motion picture as well. Take my word for it, the movie is worth the watch.

It was with trepidation that I went to see Into The Woods tonight. This movie was an adaptation of a cherished Stephen Sondheim Broadway musical which I had seen in the 80s and re-watched on DVD with my children. I set my expectations low so that I would not be disappointed. I had read about some of the casting and feared that Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep would ruin it. I loved the original and I wanted to love this. And love it I did! It was true to the musical. So much of the dialog and songs were verbatim from the play. The movie seemed to flesh out the scenes perfectly and give them more emotional oomph. I'll probably be going to see it again and definitely look forward to adding it to my Blu-Ray collection. If you love musicals, go see it. Note*** Don't let the fact that it has Red Riding Hood, a giant and a big bad wolf in it means it is a children's movie. It's not! It has adult themes all the way through.

I can't help but wonder if all the haters had ever seen a Sondheim musical, let alone Into the Woods, before. Sondheim isn't for everyone. I'd seen two touring Broadway productions as well as the televised Broadway cast production starring Bernadette Peters years ago, and have always loved this show. In fact, it's my favorite Sondheim musical. The movie wasn't flawless, but I still found it truly wonderful, and intend to see it again.Having fallen in love with Bernadette Peter's portrayal of the witch, I felt very strongly that she owned that role and could not (and still don't) understand her exclusion from the movie. That said, Meryl Streep did not disappoint in either her acting or singing. Not less than Bernadette, but different, so I was able to really enjoy her personification of the witch free from resentment. On the other hand, while Johnny Depp's performance as the wolf captured his lechery, he just doesn't have the pipes to do the song justice. Casting actors who can't sing, or who can't sing well, in movie adaptations of great Broadway musicals is a long standing pet-peeve of mine (It was all I could do to not walk out of the Sweeney Todd movie). I give him 2 out of 3 for his look and his acting, but his singing failed to make the wolf all that he should have been.I loved all the rest of the cast. The kids were annoying how? Lilla Crawford has a wonderful voice and was well cast. Jack was younger than I was used to from the Broadway productions, and had a strong voice, albeit lacking in vibrato. "Agony" was a real comedic high point. I wonder if the "Agony" reprise was shot and not used, ditto the "No More" song that didn't make it into the film. I wish both had been included. The movie was visually stunning. I went to an 10:30 AM showing on Christmas day. The theater was almost completely full, and the laughter during the movie and the applause at the end indicated my enjoyment was shared.

How I've never seen a stage version of Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods" is still a head-scratcher. My high school theatre department put on the twisted fairy tale the year after I graduated (much to my disappointment) and it has eluded me ever since. The point, excuse my digression, is it's very rare for me to go into a movie musical knowing very little of the show, but after seeing the film and chatting with those who have seen the show, it's clear director Rob Marshall and Disney's take delivers the very qualities that made the stage musical a hit.It helps to know that James Lapine, who wrote the book of the musical, wrote this screenplay. Even though he doesn't have final say in the film, there's no criticizing the movie's loyalty to the source material. This is not a Disney-fied version despite the marketing-savvy casting moves of Meryl Streep as the Witch and Johnny Depp as the Wolf. This is every bit as dark, fantastical, quirky and unusual as fans of the show have led me to expect."Into the Woods" is an amalgamation of Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk and Rapunzel all centered around the story of a Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) who discover they cannot have a child because a witch (Streep) put a curse on the Baker's father many years ago. The only way to reverse it, she says, is to go into the woods and retrieve her a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn and a slipper as pure as gold. So off they go into the woods, as do the fairy tale characters whom they seek.This is not some what it looks like: a fun super mash-up of classic stories. Rather, it's a way to explore the human truths of the fairy tale genre as Sondheim does so beautifully in his lyrics. Everything about "Into the Woods" is just a bit off from what you'd expect: not too whimsical, not too intellectual, not too dark and scary, not too childish, etc. It lives in this gray area, which makes it totally unique as a work of art, albeit a bit frustrating for the movies, where audiences like to see exactly what they expect to see. Yet there seems to be "just enough" of each of these elements to make "Into the Woods" a likable film for all.Although few are as skilled as Marshall at effectively filming a musical performance for the big screen, so much of the credit for what makes "Into the Woods" enjoyable is the cast. Streep, for example, has precisely the gravitas needed for the Witch, and it's exciting to watch such a venerated actress taking on a peculiar character. She's really the tip of the iceberg though. Blunt and Anna Kendrick (who plays Cinderella) are two of the best and most versatile actresses of their generation, and they have pipes to boot; Corden, little-known but rising quickly, strikes a terrific balance of humor, pity and heart; Youngsters Daniel Huttlestone (Jack) and Lilla Crawford (Little Red Riding Hood) are terrific finds; and although with less significant roles, Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen as the princes get the film's most entertaining musical number in "Agony." Each of these actors connects with and owns the lyrics, which are the heart of the story and the true magic of "Into the Woods," but in the wrong hands (on the wrong tongues?) can feel inaccessible or superfluous. Cinderella's song "On the Steps of the Palace," for example, is her over-analyzing and being indecisive about whether (for the third time) she should run away from her Prince. It's lyrical word vomit, and while Kendrick doesn't turn it into pure gold, she effortlessly communicates her character's inner albeit excessive dilemma and makes Sondheim's point that just because in fairy tales girls are supposed to fall in love with charming princes, doesn't mean they should run off with them without a second thought.In this example it's also easy to see that "Into the Woods" can get a bit wordy and boring. It's a fairy tale story, so we expect something breezy and entertaining, not something existential and overbearing. As much as you can appreciate how Lapine and Sondheim have challenged the notion of fairy tales by turning them around on the audience, at some points it just gets boring. The film's third act, when "happily ever after" gets turned on its head, for example, is a test of patience, even though without it, the story would have no meaning and the film would therefore become artistically pointless.This problem doesn't seem to be unique to the film, but rather, has followed the show to the big screen. All the cinematic elements work nicely here from visual effects to Colleen Atwood's costumes; this is certainly the type of story that truly stands to benefit from escaping the confines of a stage. Even so, Marshall doesn't use that as license to overdo it; he gives us tastes of visual effects here and there. In a sense, this is staying true to the musical, because it's not supposed to be a pure entertainment piece."Into the Woods" doesn't get better on the silver screen, but it clearly doesn't get worse, as most fans of stage musicals fear when their favorites get adapted. I might not be able to speak from experience, but what was a likable albeit slow musical according to my "sources" has become a likable albeit slow film. Considering "Into the Woods" has a very specific message and style, the fact that Marshall and Disney honor that is something deserving of some praise.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

A group of us went to the approximately 80% full 6pm screening of INTO THE WOODS at the Ziegfeld in Manhattan (most people at Christmas dinner? The 2pm show was apparently sold out) with a very mixed audience of theatre folk and families who applauded (more than justified - one of the joys of seeing a film musical in its first weekend; no one ever applauds later) three of the numbers and the film itself at the end. I'd have applauded four or five.I don't consider myself an INTO THE WOODS fanatic, but I did miss two of the cuts (the reprise of AGONY with its capping joke "ah well, back to my wife!", and the the Baker's final moving "No More" which almost certainly was filmed since they left in the set-up and lead out) but so much of the rest was so well done that I couldn't honestly complain, and I could understand the practical necessity of the cuts to keep the film close to a two hour event for the benefit of *exhibitors* who want as many showings as possible in a day. I do hope however, that at least the "No More" is restored for the DVD release as they restored the similarly essential "Cool, Cool Considerate Men" to the DVD of 1776.My main reaction was that "the curse is finally off films of Sondheim musicals!" This was by far the most satisfying "movie"/film version of any of the Sondheim musicals - and I include WEST SIDE STORY and GYPSY. Director Rob Marshall seems back on the track he was with his marvelous CHICAGO after his botch of NINE.As for INTO THE WOODS for the "uninitiated," it will probably not be for *every* audience - there was one family down front which walked out when the show got momentarily very dark near the end, and anyone insufficiently sophisticated to accept individuals singing in moments of high emotion (what a sad life they must live!) will probably be better entertained elsewhere - but between the award-worthy stellar performances of Streep's "Witch" and Corden's "Baker" (with the possible exception of Johnny Depp's "Wolf," probably cast because of his role in the film of Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD, there wasn't a weak link in the cast; the unexpectedly big voices of Lilla Crawford's "Red Riding Hood" and Daniel Huttlestone's "Jack" were a special plus! Even Tug as "Milky-White" and her doppelgänger gives a fine performance!), Jonathan Tunick's lush orchestrations, the handsome LOOK of the film (the little touch of a collapsing tower significantly improves on the time spent on stage showing the destruction wrought by Frances de la Tour's Giantess) and even the touch of near-camp (I normally loathe camp) with the Princes' (Chris Pine & Billy Magnussen) literally bodice-ripping "Agony," this is a film a lot of us will see a LOT of times with great pleasure. The Marshall film of INTO THE WOODS is not flawless - the two afore-mentioned trims to the score are, in the end acceptable, and Johnny Depp's "Wolf," while not horrible (it looks like something left over from ZOOT SUIT) made me understand for the first time how clever it was in the original to have one of the Princes double as the Wolf! 20 hours later though, I can't honestly recall any serious problems worth mentioning. (One minor "spoiler" here if you don't already know the show:) Director Marshall may have dithered over whether or not to actually kill off Tracy Ullman's excellent "Jack's Mother" in "Act II" and didn't get the shot to show her die - and didn't understand or "get" the ironic humor in the horror there; she's still moving when last we see her, even if the Baker later tells Jack she's gone! It's a nit which, even if picked, is quickly forgotten in a blissful adult evening about how, ultimately, "no one is alone" that's good enough for kids too.If it doesn't prove to be one of the TOP grossers of 2015, I trust it will do well enough to prove to the Hollywood "masterminds" that you can still have a successful movie-movie of a stage show which has been faithfully preserved *first* in its original stage version - just as those filmed Sondheim stage musicals themselves (and the MTV broadcasts of LEGALLY BLONDE!) proved to producers wise enough to notice that audiences are MORE likely to flock to something they already know they like!One last, but relatively important point: I'm mildly shocked at the number of posts on IMDb who A) complained that none of the advertising for one of the more famous MUSICALS in the last quarter century (that toured all over the country and has been aired on national television several times) "warned" people that it was a musical (I rather think that the Disney ads for their Cinderella should warn people that it *isn't*!) and B) warned people not to take children! As a 66 year old university lecturer, uncle and former elected member of a Connecticut Board of Education, I'd seriously question the fitness to *BE* a parent of anyone who "sheltered" their children (over about age 3 - any child old enough to sit through a church service) from a film like this rather than *talking* with them about it!I can certainly understand anyone not sophisticated enough to understand the idea behind musicals - that people sing when the emotions are too great for mere words - OR not caring for the length and subtlety of Sondheim's melodic lines and variations (different strokes for different folks) but this INTO THE WOODS is, perhaps, the greatest teaching opportunity I've seen in years for a *good parent*; you owe it to your kids. Don't miss it!

"Into the Woods" was an amazing movie with an all-star cast. Beginning the story was Anna Kendrick as the gorgeous Cinderella. Although they never say her name, she is one of the most crucial characters in this movie and whoever casted her was a genius. She was the epitome of talent. Her voice, acting ability, and pure charm brought such life to the movie and made it very enjoyable. That being said, the entire cast was brilliant including the creepy, yet likable, Meryl Streep, Chris Pine, Emily Blunt, James Corden, Daniel Huttlestone, and even Johnny Depp, who has a very minor part. The sets were gorgeous and the CGI was stunning and very believable, even for a fantasy world. However, the main pull of this movie was the music. Beautiful and upbeat, Stephen Sondheim and the cast did an unbelievably great job with the score. The story, to me, was a little flat, but still very well written. I didn't feel the audience received the intended emotions because the story jumped around a lot. It told the stories of many different characters simultaneously which made it a little hard to follow. Other than that, the story was just the right amount of action, romance, and suspense. This is by far the hardest review I've ever had to write because I can't put the music, beauty, story, and talent into words. Absolutely stunning! I wish this film good luck in the upcoming awards season and give it 8/10 stars.

Into the woods is a musical about all the fairy tales coming together in the woods. The witch(Meryl Streep) puts a spell on the baker and his wife. So now the baker and his wife have to go and get four different objects. The acting is great,also the singing was great by everyone(even Chris Pine), the two people who stood out was Emily Blunt(baker's wife) and Lilla Crawford(Little red riding hood). The story and how everyone is connected was brought together very well. The only minus of the movie was the final act. It seems like it lost itself and the ending seem very rushed. Overall into the woods was a good musical with great acting and singing.

I am usually not a big fan of big screen musicals, I believe they should be seen on a stage, and when Hollywoods finest Actresses and Actors starts belching out songs I usually cringe.Into The Woods was a bit different for me, I have not seen it on a stage nor have I seen the old movie version, so I am just going to judge it for what it is, a fine little 2 hour distraction from life, a smile on a cold afternoon, and it did bring a smile to my lips.They had a lot of good details from the various Grimm Fairy Tales in there, also details not everyone would know about, it is evident that the script writers know their Fairy Tales.Now on to the gritty, the music is less than memorable, very cute but also very forgetful, it certainly is no Les Mis or Phantom.Do I recommend seeing it? Wait for Netflix that is my recommendation on Into the Woods, worth a one time watch but not a classic by any means.

Sondheim is a modern master... but I've never been able to sit through the stage version of this show because the music is just so repetitive. The title song is reprised way too much as is "No One Is Alone" which also sounds far too much like Sweeney Todd's "Nothing's Gonna Harm You" at the start.BUT I loved this film, thanks to the cast and I give Mr. Marshall props for casting them all (I would've loved to have seen Joanna Lumley as the step-mother, but meh...) especially after he miscast Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart! and there really was no choreography for Mr. Marshall to screw up, like he did in Chicago. (If you're going to steal from Fosse, you have an obligation not to screw it up).Meryl Streep has positioned herself VERY WELL to take on the role of Norma Desmond should the film adaptation of Sunset Blvd ever make it to screen. Her voice has come a long way and strengthened so much! Just saw it for a 2nd time and like it even better. Mr Sondheim is as Shakespeare. If you relax and listen to the words you will be taken far away from your dreary lives! Also I wanted to add how wonderful little jack is in the film. He was just as perfectly cast as he was in Les Miz as gavroche.

If you want to watch a Hollywood reproduction of a musical, with all of the barely understandable singing and overly drawn out and melodramatic acting, then this would be right up your alley.I get that in a real musical on stage, actors have to act and sing in a way more exaggerated way than normal because it has to carry. Not so in a movie... and when you do a movie the same way as a stage musical, it can get very tiring, very quickly.I admit that I liked the first hour or so and then it became tedious... like... another song? Wait... another song? Oh no... not another song... somebody kill me... what did I do to deserve this? WHY? Oh why? Answer me, somebody... why?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!!??!There are some self-effacing and ironic moments such as when the 2 princes sing "Agony"... which was pure agony to sit through because of the horrible singing and over the top acting. It doesn't help that they made the 2 princes into pure caricatures of the characters they represented.In all, this is an enjoyable romp which doesn't take itself too seriously... until it took itself too seriously. Then it got really annoying as you cringe before the characters break into another unnecessary song which could have been conveyed via regular dialogue.

The point of movies is story-telling. If you have to ask the question I asked when I left the theater today, "Just what are you trying to say?" then you haven't told the story well. For all the fine music and excellent performances in "Into the Woods", they failed as storytellers.First, I am not the traveler and sophisticate many of my friends are, sadly. I have never seen "Into the Woods" on stage. If I had, maybe my reaction to the movie would have been different.Second, I LOVE Stephen Sondheim. There is something about his music that never fails to transport me. Well, almost never.Third, Meryl Streep is the greatest. One of my favorite jokes ends, "Are you kidding? If they cast Meryl Streep as Batman it would be perfect casting!" I agree. So I went to the theater expecting brilliance. I expected to be transported. Anything less was going to be a disappointment.Very quickly I was asking myself if Sondheim hadn't phoned it in musically. Don't get me wrong: when SONDHEIM phones it in, it's still better than 99.9% could do at their very best. But I kept waiting for it to get brilliant. It never did.Maybe I was expecting too much. I saw "Fried Green Tomatoes" after seeing "Driving Miss Daisy" and left disappointed. Years later when I saw "Tomatoes" without having seen "Miss Daisy" in such close proximity, I found I loved "Tomatoes" on its own.Maybe if I go back and see "Into the Woods" a second time, I'll like it better. But this time I left confused.One of the greatest and most important rules about storytelling is "Never pass up a good opportunity to shut up." It is one of the most important rules for preaching."Into the Woods" tries to weave together "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Little Red Riding Hood", "Cinderella", "Rapunzel", and another about a baker and his wife who can have no children. They do this fairly well. And that was when I thought the movie was over.And that was when the movie, I began to suspect, really began, or was supposed to. It became apparent that all the Good Guys had lied, stolen, schemed, and basically done anything they thought they could get away with to get what they wanted. Jack's giant realized he had been robbed, and simply came to reclaim his stolen property. Jack killed him. The giant's wife came to avenge her husband. Red Riding Hood mused that killing people is wrong, and even a giant is a person. Then they killed the giantess, and nobody ever looked back, in regret or any other way.There were hints of moral complexity, deep ethical questions, but only hints. If they were trying to make any point at all, I missed it. There are two possibilities: I am obtuse (not impossible), or they told their story badly.To my friends who trust my opinion, I say to go see the movie. See it for the spectacle, for the amazing performances by an amazing cast. Meryl is, well, Meryl. When has Tracey Ullman ever missed? Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen are hilarious as the princes. James Cordon (the Baker) was a new one for me, one I'll be looking for again! Anna Kendrick is a delight. Emily Blunt sparkled. And they had Christine Baranski! She is the whole package, perfectly capable of doing it all, and she did it magnificently.Sondheim's music and lyrics are delightful, even if they weren't as breathtaking as I expected. Well worth the price of admission.But in the end, I think they storytellers let us all down. I ask them again, "Just what were you trying to say?" If your audience leaves still asking that question, how can you have succeeded in telling your story?

When you think of Disney, what comes to mind? Most likely it's animated classics, where song and adventure come to life in some anthropomorphized creature that saves the day, or more recently A Frozen tundra with copious singing. So when you see a movie like Into The Woods coming to theaters, you might be thinking another film that follows the formula. Not the case my friends. Into the Woods comes from a musical, where the story is told through song rather than heart to hear dialogue. This movie is filled to the brim with musical numbers, with some character breaking out into song to describe an adventure, or often discussing their emotional turmoil. I won't lie that this isn't my favorite soundtrack, many of the songs sounding the same to me, but it has some character in terms of jokes and emotion that gave the film an edge. Unfortunately, i got annoyed with the songs and their use as a substitution for actually showing other scenes. The world itself is crafted beautifully, the woods brought to life in a manner no stage show can ever mimic. Marshall and team breathed life into the land, using the movie magic to give the inanimate forest a monster like quality that at first seems innocent, but then tears open its maws of darkness. This makes for a perfect arena to test our characters morals, and the darkness is a nice break from the usual sunshine and daisies theme Disney likes to do. However, the vague ending and story gaps didn't do it for me in this film, and left me a little disappointed after all the dark hell I went through. Many of the characters would disappear at times, and many of their tales ended abruptly without so much as a look to where they ended up. Overall, this film is a decent musical, but I think it is best left on stage. The world is beautiful, but Marshall I think lost some pertinent details in his adaptation, and the film lost the fun of the stage show. Again, this is not the stereotypical Disney many of you are hoping it to be, but if you are up for a little dark edge this winter give it a shot.

I wanted to fall asleep within seconds, no pardon me, milliseconds. The constant singeing was a drowning death, one that causes the greatest pain I've ever felt in my life. I will pray for all victims that watched this movie.At first there was potential, the wolf was very entertaining, but when he didn't kill anyone I was displeased. Every character except the wolf or witch was boring and mundane, this movie is for children. I felt like drowning myself lower and lower into the seat as I watched the most boring movie of all time. I wanted to throw up, fall asleep, and leave all at the same time. Warning: if you don't like wasting your time, don't wades your time and see this movie. My only hope was that life moves on, time continues and eventually this movie will end. My horror will not last a lifetime: except it dragged on and on....and I am sober and must drive, yet I feel this movie is a poisonous drug which has made my soul unconscious. I pray for all who have endured this terrible movie.

The first half was wonderful, fulfilling, and left me satisfied. All plot lines had been resolved, it was a bit cliché and cheesy, but nothing atypical of a Disney movie. Then, disaster strikes. The plot takes on a rather dark tone and becomes very hurried. All comedic and lighthearted aspects are kicked to the curb. Not to mention two of the main characters are promptly cut from the movie in a very unsettling way. All seemingly happy endings are completely dissolved in pursuit of an ending that more so reflects the harsh realities of the world. This did not take away from the talent of the cast, however, and all the musical numbers were fantastically written. All in all, the movie was great, until the downturn of events that went a bit too far and left you feeling confused, upset, and unsatisfied. The amazing first half and extremely talented cast is enough to make this movie one that is engaging and memorable.

I was thrilled with Into the Woods. I consider myself highly invested in the musical having been at the world premiere at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego. After that, having watched the video of the Broadway show dozens of times and viewing local productions. This is one of my favorite musicals. I love what Rob Marshall did with the story and I was so pleased that he stayed true to the musical. The cast is stellar!!!!! Meryl is amazing (of course) and Chris Pine's portrayal of Prince Charming was hysterical. Johnny Depp was fabulous as the Wolf. I love, love, LOVED it! I plan to see it as many times as I can and of course purchase the DVD when it is released. Go see it!!! You will love it!!!!!!!!!!

I don't like Sondheim, never have ever since I was a kid...why? because there is nothing melodic about his music...can you sing to it? is anything catchy - I do still find myself screeching from time to time "into the woods to grandmother's house" after I saw the play when I was in my teens. I also remember thinking the play was over after act 1 and making my way out of the theater not understanding why audience members were dilly dallying in their seats. Then an announcement was made to please return to your seats for Act 2. I found this same spot in the movie: when all things are resolved halfway through. OK, all children (and adults) want to see the top of the beanstalk, you will not get this in this movie. Why? I ask, when all technology now in cinema can make this possible. And what's with cutting off the giant wife's face for almost her total screen time? The cast is good...I liked little Jack the best. Anna Kendrick is just the same now too me...after 50/50, Up In The Air I don't think she has done a different character - though she can sing, like Little Red whose voice is more pleasing to the eye. I think Meryl Streep became Johnny Depp, and he is hardly in the movie - another guy who plays Ed Wood in most of his movies - but it only really worked in Ed Wood. Christine Baranski, always great, step sisters fun too. Rapunzel lady too modern looking...whatever that means. Best word in movie: "breasts". I think it could be up for Best Picture for cinematography as I was impressed by all things visual.

First, I try not to know much about a movie before going, so I can enjoy the element of surprise to it's fullest. With that said, I had no clue this was a musical. And, although I enjoy musicals on Broadway, never been a big fan on the big screen. So, to be fair, maybe that's part of the negative review. I went in with great expectations, and truly disappointed. Okay, on the plus side of things - - the music, scenery, and overall character appeal - - were beautiful at times. On the downside, the story line twisted the original fairy tales, making them dark and gloomy. It was painfully boring for the most part, and in addition to dark, words like "silly" and "daft" come to mind. It's very dark, with a lot of negative ideas for children. They even had the Prince attempting to solicit adultery. When I go to a movie, I want to leave feeling I was taken away. You don't get this feeling at all. I want to see the good in this movie. But, I simply don't understand the hoopla, nor can I find any reason to recommend it to anyone.

I saw "Into the Woods", starring Meryl Streep-Hope Springs, The Devil Wears Prada; Emily Blunt-Looper, The Devil Wears Prada; James Corden- Begin Again, The Three Musketeers_2011; Anna Kendrick-Pitch Perfect, the Twilight movies and Johnny Depp-The Lone Ranger_2013, A Nightmare on Elm Street_1984.This is a musical based on a 1987 Broadway play. The music is by Stephen Sondheim, who did the original play's music and it's directed by Rob Marshall-Pirates of the Caribbean:On Stranger Tides & Chicago. I'm not much on musicals but this one does have an interesting take on the old fairy tales-I think that is why my wife wanted to see it. James plays a baker in an old English village and Emily is his wife. They are trying to have a baby but so far, no luck. It seems that a curse has been put on the couple and that is why they can not have children. Meryl plays a witch that promises she can lift the curse, but she needs four items to assist in her spell: a cow, a red cloak, a silver slipper and some gold colored hair. This is where the fairy tales collide into a nice little tale of familiarity, involving Jack-and the bean stalk-Red riding hood, Cinderella and Rapunzel. Anna plays Cinderella and Johnny plays the big bad wolf-but Johnny does not have very much screen time-I would guess about 5-10 minutes. It's rated "Pg" for violence, action and some suggestive material and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes. If you are into musicals, you should enjoy it. I would probably buy it on DVD.

I don't know what movie all the other reviewers watched, but it most certainly wasn't Disney's newest musical "Into the Woods".The movie was a discombobulated mess, with multiple plots shoehorning each into the other (and even literally says so in a part of the movie). The songs were also forced in many cases that only seemed to be placed there to distract from the stagnant and sputtering pacing of all the plots.What really made the movie awkward was lack luster tropes they put the characters into. The Princess running from the Prince because she feels he is too good for her. The Witch that wanted her beauty back, because well, she wanted to be pretty again. The child the Witch kidnapped, hide away, then banished to a snake infested swamp, because (and i quote) "I was trying to be a good mother." literally no other explanation or reason for doing so. Also, Cinderella can talk to birds, let me repeat that, SHE CAN TALK TO BIRDS **AND** have them do things for her, like spy on people and have them PLUCK OUT her enemies' EYES, and with this GD super power she is a lowly chamber maid having the birds pick up lentils, F-ing LENTILS. The 2 princes have a duet where they are trying to out sexy each other, most likely as a type of fan-service to their 12-16 year old female audience. This movie heavily played off of Grimm's Fairy Tales. If you have not read them, you aren't missing anything special. The stories might have been revolutionary when they were written, but now-a- days, they would garner maybe a B- on an 8th grade writing assignment.Just like my title says, this movie's plot seems to be driven by the phrase "Just because we can." They don't give any reasoning for the characters motives, their role in the story, or any of their actions. The whole movie was made for shoehorning in songs. Just because they can.In all honesty, there was so SO much potential for the movie to be great, but along the way, it turned into a cheap knock off movie version of "Once Upon a Time" with music.

This movie was absolutely, positively HORRIBLE in every sense of the word. I generally don't write reviews but I was so incensed by the stupidity of this absolutely ridiculous crock o' s*** that I had to spread the word. I don't see how this movie got any positive reviews at all. I had high hopes because of the cast and I generally like what Disney makes, but this was horrendous. From the first song on, it was a disaster filled with repetitive, pointless songs that attempt to provide moral guidance but definitely DOES NOT. This movie instead has hints of rape, pedophilia, adultery, shitty parenting and basically half the cast is killed off with the remaining cast not seeming to really give a damn as it ends with the Baker starting to re- tell the same shitty story that just happened to all of them (in which his wife died, little red riding hood's grandma and mother died, and Jack's mother died)... This movie actually got me to dislike Meryl Streep a bit, which I thought was almost impossible. Johnny Depp was really not in it, he was in it for maybe 5 minutes top. Chris Pines was the ONLY good thing about this movie, and that was basically just for one of his songs which was amusing. The actress who played the little red riding hood was incredibly annoying and emotionless - if she had been killed off the movie might have been decent. I almost walked out of this movie but stayed hoping for some kind of salvation of the film towards the end -but NOPE! All in all, this was ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN, and I don't say that lightly. Please don't waste your time and money, or at least consider yourself warned.

Horrible movie they should specify on the poster The Musical a waist of money. Disney miss represent themselves i wish i could sue them for this. The trailer and previews are miss leading with shots that did not made it to the final product. Most boring film ever since Pitch Black. These type off movie its not appropriate for children and modern generations. There is a very small percentage of people that like musicals. That's why they made promotional videos very limited hiding the truth cause if they would tell the truth they knew this movie would not sell well. They should be more upfront with people and honest and they would have better customer acceptance.

When I was a child, I loved so many Disney movies. What am I saying? I STILL LOVE Disney movies! Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Mary Poppins, Bambi, all the timeless classics! The films I grew up on like Beauty and The Beast, Hercules, The Lion King, Toy Story, etc. they were great as well. However, this film, Into the Woods left me utterly disappointed and it should be a sin that it's labeled a Disney movie.The plot, I got to admit, got me interested in the film. The most popular Grimm fairy tales are all combined into one big story. You got Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Jack and The Beanstalk all together. Story goes is that a baker and his wife can't bear a child, so a witch tells them they are cursed by herself because what happened in the past between her and the baker's father. When the baker's father stole from her garden, including her magic beans, her appearance made her hideous looking. So to get even, she cursed his family and kidnaps the baker's sister, for he didn't know he had a sister in the first place. The witch demands them to gather up each object from the separate stories in order to break the spell and will rejoin his sister. By the way, IT'S A MUSICAL!Sounds good on paper, but overall, it was pretty messy to me. Let's start off with the music. I shouldn't rant on saying, "there's too much singing," because it is a musical, of course. I do enjoy a few musicals myself. Little Shop of Horrors, Grease, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers. Heck, even a good amount of films in the Disney library are musicals! But how Into the Woods executed in the music pieces, made the film drag and annoying. Not many actors and actresses aren't even harmonizing to the music. It sounds more like them shouting and blaring out words along with the tempo, showing no feeling nor passion within the story of the song they're singing. The ONLY actress that was spot on every time she sung was Meryl Streep. Her performance was excellent. Emily Blunt did have one song that she did very good on, but that was it. TWO actresses out of the several did their job. Chris Pine's singing approach was a HUGE joke. I couldn't tell his singing performance is suppose to be serious or comical, but either way, it didn't work and it was disturbing.But what got me very confused and disappointed on this movie are the plot holes. TOO MANY PLOT HOLES!!! As I can remember in the film, once the curse is broken, the baker's wife gets pregnant, the witch becomes beautiful again, and the baker can rejoin his long lost sister, which you find out later is Rapunzel. But did the baker ever meet Rapunzel? NO! THEY NEVER MEET! It looks like they could care less of each other! After the second giant destroyed the village, Rapunzel and her prince just gallops away into the darkness, not ever hearing from them again. To top it off, the witch lost her power for a brief moment for that scene.....WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?!?! Also, Jack's mother dies off screen. WHEN IN THE HELL DID THAT HAPPEN?! Last time we saw her, she was yelling at the giant and got shoved away from a wimpy, tiny man and fell flat on her back on tall, soft grass. She looked dazed and dizzy, but that's it, no sign of her dying!!! Slaying the giant was very lazy writing. Couple of rocks hits the giant in the face, killing her. The rocks they threw were pebble size compared to the giant's head. Pathetic.Overall, AVOID this movie. Even if you're a hard core Disney fan, AVOID THE MOVIE. Mediocre acting, lame songs, clearly unwatchable. Meryl Streep did her best on this film to make it look presentable, but her awesome talent couldn't save this failure of a film.

What the hell was that? We took the family to see this movie based on the trailers. It looked cool, we knew it was a musical and an adaptation of Grimms Fairy Tales. Instead we were treated to a really bad story line, bad singing and over acting (yes Meryl Streep, You!). It was so bad we left the theatre and I demanded and received a refund. Unless you're a snooty art critic, movie critic or a die hard Manhattan Broadway regular, do not go to see this garbage. This is coming from normal people who thoroughly enjoy Disney films, the Grimm Brothers movie, Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, etc. I'm not a fan of musicals but I have an open mind and yes, I can take seeing something like "Mama Mia", or "Hairspray", but I've got to draw the line when they sing the entire script from beginning to end. Oh, and did I mention that the four stories adapted by Grimms are mashed together in a mess which makes little to no sense at all? Total Crap!

I should start by saying that I had never heard of "Into the Woods" until I learned that the movie was going to get released soon. I already knew Stephen Sondheim's work, having seen a stage production of "Sweeney Todd" and Tim Burton's movie adaptation thereof. So, I went into the theater with only the information that I had picked up by reading about the movie. Now that I've seen the movie, I'm impressed. This mixture of several classic fairy tales is not a fairy in the common sense of the word. Its overall message is that life is not a fairy tale. The singing and dancing adds up to something more serious than what we expect from musicals and Disney movies.The movie's high quality owes partly to Rob Marshall's ("Chicago" and "Memoirs of a Geisha") clever direction. But Meryl Streep's performance as the witch is what really makes it. It would've been easy to simply make her a wicked witch casting evil spells on people, but she's more complex than that. She has goals and desires just as much as the humans do. Since we understand the witch's motivations, it's possible to care about her. In a way, she's just as human as the people. This is not to ignore the fine performances of the rest of the cast. Anna Kendrick, James Corden, Emily Blunt, Chris Pine, Lilla Crawford and Daniel Huttlestone play their roles perfectly, with great support from Tracey Ullman, Christine Baranski, MacKenzie Mauzy, and Johnny Depp in a brief appearance.In the end, I found it to be a good movie. It's worth noting that this is NOT a movie for the little ones. The movie contains mature undertones and has scenes that might upset tykes. But if you can handle these, then you're sure to enjoy the movie. It's not a masterpiece, but I thought that they did a good job with it. I'm not a fan of musicals at all, but I liked the songs. So go see it.

Wonderfully atmospheric Disney production based on the Sondheim musical is a delightful family film that is certain to be another hit for the company (this is a good companion piece to their other hit, Angelina Jolie-starring "Maleficent"). It reboots various fairy tale stories (Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Cinderella, Jack and the Bean Stalk), incorporating them together into one film about a couple (James Corden and Emily Blunt, a cute pair) unable to bare children due to the curse of a hideous witch (Meryl Streep, herself cursed with ugliness due to losing magic beans). This witch has a beautiful daughter, Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy, absurdly lovely), with long blond hair, she has trapped away in a tower with no exit. Rapunzel is spotted by a handsome prince (Billy Magnussen) and the two eventually fall in love. You know the story with Cinderella (Anna Kendrick, given nice star treatment among the cast of great names), stuck in the horrid environs of her nasty stepmother and stepsisters, wishing to be free, blessed with an elegant gown and slippers by the spirit of her mother located in the woods at the gravesite where a towering tree now resides. Three nights, she flees the ball, much to the chagrin of a charming prince (played with assured cockiness by Chris Pine, milking his blessed looks with a knowing wink) who wants to marry her. Then there's Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), needing to make some money for his poor widower mother, a cow exchanged for magic beans when he contacts Corden's Baker (Streep's witch demands a "white as milk" cow, a lock of "yellow as corn" blond hair, golden slipper, and "red as blood" cape from the Baker and his wife before three strikes at Midnight as the Moon will be Blue and restore her the beauty taken away), dropped on the ground and releasing a beanstalk to the heavens. Jack steals large coins to get his cow back. Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) encounters "Mr. Wolf" (a much too little used Johnny Depp) in the woods, is convinced by him to seek out a nice bouquet of flowers, forcing her to stray off the path against her mother's orders, while traveling to her grandmother's tree home. Wolf will gobble up both of them but Baker may just be in the right place at the right time to save them. As you might expect, the fairy tales reach what appear to be "happy ever afters" but Jack's thievery and murder of the giant (coming down the beanstalk for his stolen golden harp) causes a vengeance-seeking wife giant to trample through the woods, villages, and castles looking for the little boy that made her a widow. Lots of songs sung by a game cast bringing their A-game, Streep knows her part takes a lot of oomph and chutzpah while Corden and Blunt must emphasize their determination and frustration endured because of something committed by a thieving patriarch. Jack does a lot of stealing and this causes some repercussions that affect a lot of people. The conclusion of Cinderella's story as it pertains to her prince and bond with Jack, Red Riding Hood, and Baker is a nice surprise which goes in an unexpected direction. Depp is so much fun in his cameo, I wished he had an extended part in the film. One musical number seems so little use of his dynamic screen presence. As can be expected, details regarding the fairy tales are glossed over as "Into the Woods" is ultimately about the Baker and his wife trying to secure a pregnancy denied them. Streep's gaining her beauty back and all she has done to those around her due to losing it is a good lesson on the pratfalls of vanity and its destruction and harm towards others. The Gothic beauty of the woods is a character unto itself and most of the action located there gives the film a stunning backdrop for the story that transpires there as numerous fairy tale characters join together to help defeat a major threat to them all. Also incorporated into the movie is David and Goliath from the Bible. Should be another Sondheim megahit and this was wisely released during Christmas to capitalize on the appeal towards the gathering of the family unit. The theater I was in with my kids was a packed house.

OMG - this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First, despite an excellent cast including the amazing Meryl Streep, the characters were wholly unlikable. Even in movies with despicable characters, someone is likable. Hannibal Lector is more endearing than the characters in this offering. Secondly, you may be surprised to learn that this was a musical; a fact mysteriously missing from the array of TV promos for the film. That said, I do enjoy some musicals and own DVD's of West Side Story and Les Mis. The music in this film was neither inspirational nor emotionally moving despite the talented performers. Lastly, the plot meandered aimlessly to the point where a swift demise of the entire cast would have been preferable to the the protracted ending. Buyer beware - do not see this movie.

Let me begin by saying that I picked the Christmas movie this year for my entire family and with the cast of this movie I did expect more. My mistake. I will never hear the end of this.. I loved Meryl Streep and Johnny Depp but I plan write him a letter about his portrayal of a pedophile. Which as it turns out was the least of the movies problems. The song between the two hero men was the most ridiculously funny thing I have seen in years and would be OK, had it not been a cheap sexual battle between two men who were meant to appeal to young girls, by Disney.I did get the message of the movie and the deep contradictions, however, they were portrayed in such a way they were offensive, even to those wanting to like the movie or hoping for more. Even though I love musicals, I was put off by the songs which weren't needed every 15 minutes. IT is a dark fairy tale which could have had a much better story line and far different ending which was somewhat twisted. But acceptable, at least they didn't leave Cinderella in the woods with her birds. This was meant for the stage and while excellent casting was done, this was too much like a play and nothing like a movie.

By far the worst, most convoluted Disney movie EVER and easily the most over rated, over anticipated, over hyped movie that fell so far short of it's promises from Disney EVER. This movie rambles on, and on and on without any sense of either direction or purpose and when the audiences feel there may be some relief in sight, back into the woods we go. The music is forgettable throughout and not single tune stays with you. Although it claims to be 124 minutes it feels much MUCH longer. THis is a dreadful, dreadful movie and whoever at Disney put their stamp of approval on the script, the director and the soundtrack should really be working somewhere else, perhaps driving a Disney resorts bus. I have ALWAYS been a fan of Disney and always respected their choices, not this time. THIS WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!

The only good thing in this film is the singing of Lilla Crawford who plays Little Red Riding Hood and starred on Broadway in the most recent revival of Annie. The film is static, moribund and turgid. All of the irony and wit of the Broadway show is gone. The direction is stilted and boring. Rob Marshall is no Arthur Freed (the producer of the glorious MGM golden era of musicals, a composer and in the pantheon of the Great America Song Book and behind the scene director the films he produced). Whose smart idea was it to cast actors with no Broadway or West End Musical experience save Crawford. Emily Blunt, Chris Pine Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp instead of those capable of performing in a Broadway Musical! Ridiculous. I saw the original Broadway production of Into the Woods with Bernadette Peters, Joanna Gleason, Chip Zion and the late great Tom Aldridge. It was witty, funny, ironic and entertaining.

Who needs water-boarding when you can strap a terrorist into a chair and force them to watch this movie? They'll be begging to tell everything they know. The two stars are for (1) casting Chris Pine and (2) the musical number "Agony", which was delightful. Even Meryl Streep and Johnny Depp were awful in this tedious, direction-less mess of a musical that is completely lacking in continuity. The songs are overburdened with lyrics that the writer must have thought were terribly clever... but with not a single memorable melody. DO NOT take young kids to this film unless you want to explore a dark mash-up of beloved childhood tales that explore themes like pedophilia, murder, mutilation, adultery. I cannot believe studio executives sullied the Disney name by releasing this stinking turd of a movie - the antithesis of everything that was good about "Frozen". If I hadn't been with extended family, I would have walked out. Unless you are an ardent fan of the original Broadway musical, stay away!

This is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. It started by intertwining a collection of well known fairy tales, which are characterized by having happy endings. The musical aspect of the movie commands respect; however, its dramatic structure is very loose and incoherent, especially in the last 45 minutes of it.The movie introduces adult themes like infidelity, death, justified killing, which are probably more apt for a different genre, but not for a children movie during the Christmas season (parents watch out). It also difficult to understand why the fairy tale nature of the movie was so distorted near the end of it. The cast members are true professionals, who should have challenged the director and screenwriter every day of production (just like Alec Guinness did when working with David Lean); otherwise, they should have rejected the roles out of respect for the genre.In summary, the movie is a bit hard to follow because it is rather incoherent and badly edited, which should not be expected from Disney. I hope the movie generates more discussion to help film plot developments in the future.

Warning: Spoiler.There are a number of reviewers who simply do not realize this movie is an adaptation of a Stephen Sondheim stage play. A number of complaints about the second act, I call it that is because that's what it is. It follows the second act of the play. The movie follows the play. It seems to me the people who disliked the second act and the ending, simply didn't get it. This is Sondheim at his best. The adaptation was spot on. I was afraid that the essence of the play would be lost. It wasn't This is a whimsical, entertaining, fun film; the likes of which we have not seen in a long time. To all those involved, well done!

I'm not a huge musical guy, but the tremendous cast got me excited to see Into the Woods. I have to say it's no Les Miserables, but it's certainly better than Nine, Rob Marshall's last directed musical. It has a lot of charm but not as much pizazz or flamboyance as Les Miserables did. It wont get as many if at all Oscar nominations but it is a fun film to go see this time of year.I really think all of the performances are great. Emily Blunt is one of my favorite actresses and she absolutely kills it as the Baker's wife. Her and her husband are two of the only real life like people amongst this extraordinary fairy tale. It involves just about all of the classic woods fairy tales we have all come to love. Anna Kendrick plays Cinderella, although a much different one than we are familiar with. That's one of the things I enjoyed about this film was the unpredictability of it. They twist many of the stories we all know to make them fresh which I can appreciate. Chris Pine plays Prince Charming and has many of the best comedic moments throughout the film. I wasn't too keen on his character to begin with but he definitely grew on me.Meryl Streep is good as usual but I don't think worthy of her Golden Globe nomination. Even the child actors I thought were serviceable. I don't know how much they adjusted the actor's voices or if at all, but I thought they really did this music justice. It definitely had me humming it for awhile after. But most of my problems with the film involve pacing and the length. I haven't seen the play but did it need to be 2 hours? I just didn't think the content was good enough to add that extra 30 minutes on at the end. I felt the second half dragged a little bit considering most of the films fun involved seeing all of these characters pop up for the first time. It's a film that many can enjoy but only a few will love. I will say that Johnny Depp's role and performance was pointless. His wolf came off borderline child molester-ish.+Blunt +Pine's surprising comedic talent +Catchy music +Twist on known fairy tales -Pacing & length -Depp 7.0/10

I saw this movie, and everything was *awesome!*......until Act I ends. Before I get to negatives, let me say the music is very faithfully reproduced here. The singing is good (in some cases great), the acting is good, the costumes and "sets" are also often good. Everything was in place to make this the definitive version of Into The Woods......and then they threw Act II out the window. People unfamiliar with the musical might not notice or care about the changes to Act II (or technically Act III), but fans of the musical should be warned that this show is completely drained of all gravitas and pathos. Also, several wonderful songs have been cut- it will tick you off. SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!So if you've seen the musical, you know how Act II goes. More importantly, you know the great songs there. Well for some reason (PG rating, perhaps), Disney has cut everything about Act II that gives the entire show meaning. #1- Rapunzel does not die. This ruins the Witch's arc in Act II. No reprise of Children Don't Listen, and the witch leaves the movie rather abruptly in Last Midnight. And of course, Rapunzel is almost completely pointless to the story now, since nothing bad ever happens to her and her prince stays happily married to her, which brings me to...#2- No second "Agony." This was my favorite song in the damn show, and they cut it. Of course, the cut everything building up to this too- We don't get to see the princes and their wives tire of married life, nor do the baker and his wife, which comes to...#3- The Baker and his wife have no troubles in Act II. There's no fall from grace for these two- they never have to deal with a stressful marriage. The wife only kisses the prince (no sex), and the action leading up to that point is far from justified. Her lyrics about "And/Or/Both" are groundless here- it's still a fun song, but there's no reason for her to be singing it. #4- No Narrator. He shows up as an apparition, but does not get to sing "no more," which is the other best song in the musical. This also hastens the Baker's journey- while he still hits the main points of his arc, we're denied any real struggle here. #5- Arguably, the entire point of the musical is missing. The stage version breaks down "happily ever after" and teaches a real lesson about loss and how gray the world really is. The movie...does not. So I can't really recommend this to fans of the musical, unless you can accept the loss of Act II. People unfamiliar with the musical might still enjoy it.

I enjoy musicals, but this was just dreadful. I was bored and waiting for the movie to be over with. The music didn't flow with the story and instead slowed down the film. For example, I sat there thinking, "Kill the giant's wife instead of talking and singing about it." I am a fan of the Grimm Brothers' Fairy Tales, and they kept with the original story, it being darker. However, I didn't understand the purpose of the witch's character, and felt Meryl Streep could have picked a better project. All of the characters were flat and never truly developed. Also, why did Prince Charming still go and search for Cinderella knowing that the Baker's wife had the other slipper? Any person with a brain would have mistaken her for the mystery girl. Also why would a girl just hand over her cloak so willingly when her grandmother gave that to her? He saved her life, so what? You don't give a stranger your own personal treasure. Also she would no longer be Red Riding Hood, but Wolf Hoodie Girl from Hot Topic. This musical butchered each of the fairy tales, and didn't work as a whole unit. I'd rather watch Shrek which made each fairy tale character interesting. Even Hoodwinked is better than this movie. I cannot believe this movie won awards. Even magic beans cannot save this movie. I'm not sure how the theatrical production looks like, but the story and music is not movie material. Save your money and your time.

My daughters opinion of this first........Daddy can we leave after about 40 minutes into it and her twisting and turning in the seat for 20 minutes at least. Daddy's opinion about 20 minutes into it, same thing. The trailer is clearly deceptive by leaving out the singing while the witch talks...........enough of it really, A movie with a few songs like Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty bang bang etc...and it's okay. The whole movie makes this not a movie! This is NOT Disney material and NOT worth wasting my time. If I had not been using free passes, I would have demanded my money back! I mean Johnny Depp showing off his skills for a singing pedophile? This is some sick stuff and for someone brainwashed into thinking this sort of thing is good. Bottom line, this movie was portrayed in the trailers to be for a child with the Disney branding and trailer, which left out the singing likely to garner more views. Big mistake Disney! I think folks will be a little more wary of your trickery now. There is a difference between a movie and a musical. Bad judgement call to deceive the consumer and not make this abundantly clear it was a musical. Someones job should be on the cutting block for this one without a doubt!

I liked it but came away thinking it wasn't as good as I expected. So I went back and watched the play (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099851/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_34)It's way, way better. The movie leaves out some of the most interesting material giving a much blander result, from the points of view of both comedy and drama.And while I like Meryl Streep, Bernadette Peters pulls off the role way better (it helps that she has all the original material to work with rather than a watered-down version.)So if you like the movie, watch the play. If you love the play, you might like the movie but don't get your hopes too high. I have to try to convince my friends and family who are lukewarm on the movie that the should watch the play.

Into The Woods is a sick, twisted story that is beyond bad or rotten. It tells that audience that unless you are a newborn baby everyone - no matter what your age or social class - is corrupt and despicable! (If you want to see a fantasy film that is the best I've ever seen in my life then buy Hallmark's & Jim Henson's "Jack and the Beanstalk - The Real Story." It is suitable for all ages and you may even cry your brains out while watching it the first time, like I did!)I've never before seen a movie that should have been rated PG-13 or R rated PG. Never in my life - and I have been going to movies for at least 45 YEARS! Let me ask you this: Is three separate acts of thievery of an innocent individual's most valuable possessions - that leads to an act of manslaughter by a child, no less, worthy of only a PG rating? Then add another act of manslaughter, with the assistance of all the adults around him worthy of just a PG rating? Then another act of manslaughter by an adult killing the child's mother worthy of just a PG rating? Then the accidental death of another adult hero worthy of just a PG rating? How about leaving a new born child with a pre-teen with zero babysitting experience, as if that was not a big deal, worthy of just a PG rating. How about a kidnapper isolating her alleged daughter first in a castle with no escape, then in a rather flimsy hut made of twigs - in a swamp in the middle of nowhere - worthy of just a PG rating? How about one of the characters that was murdered looking exactly like an elderly grandmother is that worthy of only a PG rating? Or how about a flock of birds pecking out the eyes of two women is that worthy of only a PG rating? In the world of "Into the Woods" blindness is funny! How sick and twisted can you get? How about a totally innocent man having his eyes poked out by thorn bushes, is that worthy of only a PG rating. (Does it really matter if he is innocent or or not, this film was rated PG!) And last, but not least, let's not forget one women having their toe cut off and another having there heel of their foot cut off? Wow! I've never seen acts amputation to be hilarious until now (I'm being sarcastic!) Is that worthy of only a PG rating? This Film Is So Bad It Is Making Me Feel Nauseous! I may even throw-up by the end of the night! Most people have better things to do then write a movie review when they feel this sick to their stomach. But if I help prevent one young person or adult from seeing this film and being deceived and traumatized, like I was, then it's well worth the effort.I want to make it clear there are NO good guys in this film. I could care less about any of the characters except for the newborn child and the two murdered giants. Whoever had anything to do with this film knew exactly what they were doing. If adults want to see sick and twisted be my guest! But to market this as a movie suitable for children and then to have the film's rating gamed in order to maximize profits is an act of evil, plain and simple! Sorry, but I call a spade a spade. What I would like to really say will be censored, so let your imagination run wild! On the subject of maximizing profits: Ticket sales are considerably down from last year and you wonder why? I was looking forward to seeing two other movies. Now I'm not going to see them! Hollywood and movie theater owners you made $11.50 off of me! Now you're going to loose because you would have made $34.50 had you not gamed the rating. I don't care in slightest how good the other films might be. I'll wait till I can buy them for a PENNY on Amazon! Now multiply that by lots of people across the world and I don't care how palatial you build your new movie theaters - I have zero interest in stepping inside! Zero! Zero! Zero! Antagonizing your loyal customers by trying to boost your quarterly statement at the expense of your annual statement is dumb, dumb, dumb! Hasn't anyone in Hollywood taken Accounting 101? Hollywood, use that evil genius of yours for good and you will make more money, not less! Duh!

It should have been filmed in 3D. I'm boycotting "Into the Woods" because we are not given the option of viewing it in 3D. The directer chose not to film in 3D because he didn't want it to have the look of a cartoon, but I think this film calls for 3D. At least give us the option of viewing it that way. I was so looking forward to it. I guess I've been spoiled with 3D. It's as if I had been watching films in black and white, and then am exposed to films in color, and then having to go back to black and white. Imagine watching the Wizard of Oz in black and white when you know it could be shown in color. 3D gives me the feeling that I am inside the experience rather the just watching it.

It's a musical, based on a Broadway play (no really, it's a musical). A misrepresented boring film, how the movie could have received a green light, just shows how little fresh ideas Hollywood has. Okay, am I being too harsh, I'm sure there will be some enjoyable tunes, interesting sets, adorable characters or some interesting twists on stories that really is en vogue at this time. No, No, No, and No! Not one memorable song, how is that possible Stephen Sondheim! Okay maybe it's not his fault, apparently Disney took a PG-13 to R rated play and tried to recreate the movie as a family picture. Where is the millions of dollars in production values? drab, dark sets with deficiency of most color. I wouldn't want to say that the movie has horrible special effects, more an absence of them. A majority of the actors are miscast, it is literally impossible to care about any character. The philandering prince and baker's wife are certainly people, I would want my kids too aspire to be. By the end of the movie, where you have dedicated over two hours of your time, you start imagining how, if all of the characters die, maybe the movie would make sense. Just stick with televisions, "Once Upon a Time", for interesting twists on your favorite fairy tales.

Left the theater I just could not take the pain. Many others left as well Reading the reviews I am stunned at the number of positive reviews. Perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen I want those two hours of my life back. What am I missing, wonderful cast but the movie just dragged on and on with most songs boring at best. I did enjoy two princes singing - that was funny, but otherwise terrible movie. Save your money!! Cast was great but unused talent. What were folks thinking. Tried to nap during the movie but woken up by the the notes off key. Movie was confusing and just wandered from song to song without an much of a connection to a story. Again, I cannot get over how many positive reviews are out there as so many left the theaters as did I after about two-thirds of the movie and with no end in sight.

Dreadfully bad casting that doomed it from the start. Painfully amateurish lyrics, painfully bad music, painfully bad storyline, painfully bad script that even the best talent and fair camera work cannot save. Absolutely painful. Depp's costume? My only emotional reaction was sympathy for the career damage being done to the actors. Despite seeing nearly every movie that is in wide release every year, this is only the fifth movie I remember having walked out of in as many decades. (Blount and Streep can carry these roles, but Depp? Kendrick as heroine? O. M. G. Seriously? Chris Pine? Did Maisler and Tesley farm it out to Canfield while taking a vacation? )

Enjoyed this film immensely. Let me start out by saying I have seen the Bernadette Peters production online and watched parts of it countless times, so I'm one of those who was quite nervous about how the film would translate to the screen. Overall I am satisfied. I promised myself I wouldn't expect perfection.The cast is excellent. Anna Kendrick is my favorite, she does not put a single wrong foot forward, and her character makes sense. Emily Blunt and James Corden as the two main characters are very good. Meryl is also very good; not 100% sure of whether her voice was good enough for some of the songs her character sings.The only character I found upsetting was Chris Pine's Cinderella's Prince. He seemed to mug his way through the film. Also, don't understand why they made Johnny Depp's Wolf a man in a zoot suit instead of a wolf who could sing.Already thinking about seeing the movie again, to appreciate it more. And by the way, I don't understand the harsh criticism towards Rob Marshall. Loved Nine and Chicago.

This was the most stupid, sexually inappropriate (like, pedophilia, not South Park), unnecessarily long movie I have seen this year. It's like an awful mash up of Brothers Grimm and Les Miserables. The plot made no sense, the characters lacked depth, and the songs were completely unnecessary half of the time and added nothing to the movie. I think it was a great idea to make a musical that combined fairy tales, but the way they did it was plain awful. Meryl Streep was the only good part about this movie. I feel like Johnny Depp was only cast to be able to have his name on it, as he was in less than five minutes of the movie. The sheer stupidity portrayed by the actors (save Streep... most of the time...) made me want to hurl things at the screen and walk out of the theater. Then, there's a part where you're thinking "Oh, good! This is the end!" and you would be happy. But no, they added on an extra almost 45 minutes of worthless, plot-ruining story that added nothing to the movie. Do. Not. Go. See.

This movie is total mess of stories with sensuous prince. This movie must be prohibit under age of 16 because get confuse children's understanding of old stories! This is probably the worst movie of Disney! Johnny Depp is playing third rate role for a couple of minutes as the wolf. This movie is non-sense. Neither of all old stories are the same as they were written. Further more this movie is musical. The costumes, the make-up, the scenery is good, but the plot is awful. This movie will corrupt the small kids who were impatiently waiting for another marvelous story for Disney! This movie is ridiculous and Disney should payback the money of all visitors who went to see this movie. Please guys do not waste your time with nonsense.

This is a good movie and the entire cast does a very good job but it is not what I thought it was going to be. After seeing the commercials, sneak peeks and behind the scenes shorts I was expecting a movie more in line with the typical Disney fare; a scene providing some information and maybe a story point or two then a song (i.e. Toy Story, High School Musical, etc.). "Into the woods" is more in line with a traditional Opera where every line is done in song. The actress playing Red Riding Hood does a terrific job with her part of the song "Into the woods," you can hear a part of it in the commercials. There is only about 10 minutes of spoken dialogue in the entire movie.Bottom line is if you do not like the opera production format wait for this movie to come to Netflix (or however you rent movies) so you don't feel so bad about spending so much money if you can't sit through the entire movie.

What. A. Cast. I could detail the performance of every actor in this film, but I will just say that the talent is amazing. And just when you think Meryl Streep can't show us anything that will enhance her already amazing career, she pulls off this performance. When listening to her sing, Julie Andrews even came to mind. Unbelievable.As for the story itself, "Into the Woods" is a mash-up of the traditional fairy tales. In the first third of the film, the characters are established and we learn what they are tasked to do. In the second third, there is a resolution. But the film turns from good to great in the third section, where the story turns from traditional tracks to new territory, where the characters change from fairy tale beings to human beings.Being a musical, this film is not for everyone. And Sondheim is not for everyone. Many of his songs are more about the words than the music and, thus, are not as hummable as what you would find in "Phantom of the Opera". The visuals are terrific. The special effects are convincing. Rob Marshall really has created another world, where not all fairy tales come true but everything seems possible.

This musical was really cute. Also, overly corny which I didn't mind. However, it was very disheartening that the prince was so willing to be unfaithful to Cinderella. It was almost as if Disney was trying to make it more acceptable to be unfaithful and "live in the moment" without care. As a female that grew up fantasizing that fairy tales can come true, It was as if someone stomped on my reality. Everyone had an amazing voice, and it was decent directing. Nonetheless, the prince didn't seem right, even in the beginning, which threw off the movie quite a bit(great actor/ beautiful voice/not a the right part for him).This was not a scary movie, just a very corny musical based on fairy tales.

I gave my family a Christmas gift this year. It is a board game called "A Winter's Tale." We haven't even had a chance to take it out of the box yet, but the premise, as I understand it, is each player has the opportunity to "redirect" a fairy tale by injecting their own plot twists and character twists.Why am I telling you this? Because if I played the game with a half dozen 1st graders, I strongly suspect the end result wouldn't be any worse than the "Into the Woods" screenplay. For example: COMPLETE AND TOTAL SPOILERS AHEAD (OR MAYBE NOT)Ooh ooh....then the evil witch is really Rapunzel's step-mother...but then the prince is really a bad guy who doesn't really love Cinderella...ooh! ooh! then the witch loses all her magic! but first she brings the cow back to life...then little red riding hood dares Jack to steal a golden harp for her...but then the baker's wife dies but he doesn't seem all that upset about it...ooh, but first she cheats on him with Cinderella's prince! ooh! I know I know! Then Cinderella's bird friends blind her evil stepsisters....then the giant's wife comes down and is really mad...." In the end it is a crying shame this movie is so lousy. Consider: 1. The cast and the acting are terrific 2. The first half of the movie was often clever and engaging. The second half just dragged on and on and on 3. Americans just can't get enough of these "re-imagined fairy tales" these days.Ultimately, however, it was just way too long, way too random and just way too uninteresting.If you must go see it, ask if you can leave halfway through and pay half price.

Rob Marshall takes the Broadway hit to the awaiting masses. To his credit, the storyline remains quite accessible and his direction clever is enough, but with this genre, the acting is always a bit imprisoned by the signing dialog. another notch down due to being musically non- memorable apart from the opening tune and some lines in a few others. The song "Agony" is a clear exception and was one of the times that a double entredre allowed some depth. Into The Woods is visually compelling and there are a lot of "after the moral has ended" messages tightly packed in to the lyrics, but not so neatly as to thankfully keep it from being labeled envelope pushing Hollywood drech. I'd watch it again but not in the theater.

There is some great singing and a number of fantastic scenes in Into the Woods. However, overall, this movie is a real downer. Not a movie for kids or romantics.Into the Woods takes a number of fairy tales, mixes them up, and spits out a very muddled and confusing film. Unlike most fairy tales, there is no happy ending for any of the characters.For example, the baker's wife (played by Emily Brunt) and childless because of a magic spell, learns the lesson that she can have a husband, a child, and make out with Cinderella's prince before she falls off a cliff.At some point, Into the Woods began to seem endless. I found myself wondering if the movie would provide any kind of emotional reward for watching it. It didn't. Don't say you weren't warned.

The movie was HORRIBLE (yes - caps intended). I wish I could get the 2 hours back as well as my money. We even asked others when we left and they said the same thing!!! It's a musical (but not really since it's the same song OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN with different words) and I am really surprised Disney promoted this...This is your warning - if you do go, make sure to pick an aisle seat so you can leave quickly...Go see other movies instead - you'll thank me.NOTE: If the critics say a movie is good - you know it's horrible!Save your money!!

I wanted to give the film a one star review, but it earned an extra star for little more than spending quite a bit of money to make the film at least mildly visually appealing. Here is a brief summary of my thoughtsActing = atrocious even by musical theatre standards. Meryl Streep, ugh....... I understand all the characters are supposed to be fleshed out versions of pretty one dimensional tropes. But holy lord...... It was enough to make me pity the actors in the film. Embarrassing and vapid portrayals lacking any sense of depth. This could very well be symptomatic of the poor choices made by the director. Story = obnoxiously heavy handed with the blended family, fairy tale of previous generations is over, lets take all of the fairy tales a step too far motif. Utter nonsense. Not one character compelled me to care for them. Not one big decision made by the characters made any kind of sense based on previous behavior or common sense. Case in point: a main character goes from focused and loyal, to seduced, to guilty, to ...... well I won't spoil it.... in a matter of 4 minutes. Maybe it was actually penned by a child. Enormous pacing problems. The film just wouldn't end. And talk about an anti-climactic end. The big "baddie" isn't even introduced until there is 40 minutes left in the film. and Oh, how those 40 minutes drag and drag and drag by. Music = the first 30 minutes of the film was enough to cause a brain tumor. All the characters are introduced in one song without any hook or melody, just talking to music. Throughout the score, no discernible melodies, memorable songs, nothing. Maybe the only film adaptation of a musical where I didn't leave the theater humming one of the tunes. Humor = Yikes... There were obvious moments where characters were supposed to be funny. Small asides or jokes or tongue in cheek quips. Completely fell flat. Not one person laughed in an almost full theater during the entirety of the film.I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea.A moment that really summed up the film, was upon leaving the theater, my girlfriend (Who absolutely adores musicals and especially film versions) looked at me and said. "What the hell was that?"Rob Marshall, how far you have fallen. Maybe next time choose a musical with good source material instead of.......well........ whatever that was!

First i want to just say this movie surprised me in many ways, I actually didn't expect this movie to be so good. The music was incredible, the story was great due to that they stuck with the Grimm stories core. All the actors were perfect, some actors were known but then to take a D roll hand full of of actors and make them shine like that is amazing.Now I read some of the other reviews on here I keep seeing just the worst reasons not to enjoy this movie. Some are saying the stories are "not right and too dark". Well it is spot on the Grimm fairy tales and they actually lighted them up a bit, taking away the actual blood and not showing any gore. Then people are complaining about the actors.(like always) All I have to say is that they did a great job with picking actors. They took Chris Pine a actor mainly known for action and showed us what he can really do. Just from watching the song Agony by him was jaw dropping, I'm glad i know what he can really do and I hope he does more movies like this. Also taking a young actress only know for Broadway and putting her in this was also great to see, Lilla Crawford was amazing.I highly suggest this movie to those who enjoy musicals and fairy tales. I do think it shouldn't be PG, due to the darker aspect of the fairy tales. But overall you will be blown away with outstanding music that keeps the story moving in a nice pace. The actors and their performances will have you in awe with there singing and acting. Then the creative beauty of the scenery and colors is just amazing, truly is beautiful. This movie is fantastic in every way possible!

This was a huge success, most people who don't like or understand must have not understood that it was a Broadway musical. This storyline is rich with moral teaching on contentment and discontentment. Listen to the lyrics and you will hear and learn about life. Stay with Me and Children Will Listen are from parents perspectives. Into the Woods in a metaphor for going out into the subjective unknown. It's about life between where one Is and where one strives to be. It is about acting on your feelings and intuition but it is a tale of caution. It reminds that life without object morals and rules is chaos. I could go on but I won't. It was well done.

Let me be the first to admit that musicals aren't usually my thing;; especially ones in which every line is sung rather than spoken. Yet I found Into the Woods thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end, and I have a strong feeling you will too. Between its talented cast, upbeat musical numbers, and subtly sly mish-mashed retelling of timeless fairy tales, this is a very fun movie.For those not familiar with the Broadway musical, Into the Woods tells the intertwined tales of Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, and Rapunzel, connected by a childless baker, his wife, and the evil witch who cursed them. The writers of this play and movie have done a very good job of combining the four classic fairy tales, along with the new material into one plot line that is not only coherent but quite clever as well, with each story building on the others and their characters crossing paths in the most amusing ways. And just when you think it's over things start to get serious and we see what happens after the happily ever after.Better than the story, good as it is, is the acting. The filmmakers have assembled a stellar cast of Hollywood veterans and unknowns who bring their smartly updated characters magically to life. James Corden and Emily Blunt make a lovely couple as the baker and his wife. Occasionally bickering, sometimes blundering, the two are clearly deeply in love and will do whatever they have to to break the curse on them, even if they have no idea how they're going to do it. Chris Pines is suitably handsome, charming, and more than a little vain and narcissistic as the hopelessly romantic if rather self-absorbed prince. For her part Anna Kendrick is beautiful and sympathetic, if slightly clueless as Cinderella.My favorite performance was that young Lilla Crawford, who is tough, sassy, and almost endearingly blunt as the freeloading, endlessly hungry Little Red Riding Hood. Watching her beat up the baker and pull a knife on Jack, it's hard to believe the wolf ever got his paws on her. The most impressive and skilled performance however would have to go to Meryl Streep. In her turn as the witch Streep is manic, cackling, alternately frightening and hilarious, and not entirely right in the head. I can't imagine anyone else giving such a delightfully oddball performance and I'm sure she must have enjoyed every moment spent hamming it up.Into the Woods is further buoyed by its excellent score. The titular opening chorus will get stuck in your head, and Your Fault is surprisingly catchy for a rapid fire exchange of blame. It Takes Two and Agony are somewhat less magically, the former being too sappy for its own good and the latter too repetitive and self-aggrieved, but thankfully these are outliers. The cast all sing remarkably well, Kendrick in particular having a beautiful voice.In addition to being well acted and well scored, this movie is also a very funny one. There's plenty of slapstick and physical gags along with some sharp wordplay and hilariously absurd scenes like a half crazed woman frantically trying to steal another woman's shoes right off her feet, or hijinks with a counterfeit cow. There's also a fair amount of darker humor, along with a continual undercurrent of satire which deconstructs the old tales by inserting a degree of modern sensibilities and a small dose of reality, as when the prince admits "I was raised to be charming, not sincere." There were however a few parts that didn't quite work for me. Johnny Depp is certainly creepy as the wolf, although perhaps a bit too creepy and the wrong ways, given that it's a little girl he's singing to. And while Cinderella's stepmother's attempts to get her daughters feet into the slipper are certainly comical, they rather macabre for a family musical.Others have also complained that this production as a whole is dark, especially in the second act. They're not entirely wrong. This movie does hint at some very grown up themes and racks up quite a body count for a family musical. But the darker aspects have actually been toned down a fair amount from the source material, and the ending is not nearly as bleak as some would suggest. Far from being that death is inevitable or that happy endings only happy in fairy tales, the moral of this story is that even after deep loss there can be happy endings, even if they weren't the one you were expecting.

With an amazing cast, director and legitimate potential, this should have been a good movie. Instead, it was awful. The stories and fairy tales did not coincide. The music did not really make sense. The actors had very little chemistry. Meryl Streep's character was over the top and confusing to anyone watching. Emily Blunt was also wasted. The Jack and the Beanstalk portion complete with Giant made no sense. Little Red Riding Hood absolutely did not have anything to do with the story. It was just a giant hodge podge of crap. This would have been a decent made for TV movie, but to sit through 2 hours and spend the money I did, I was highly disappointed. One of the worst and most pointless movies I have seen in many years. Please do not waste your time.

This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I can't believe I sat through the whole thing. I knew that "Into the Woods" was a musical, but I never dreamed the singing would continue, almost nonstop, throughout the movie; singing the same tune on and on, but with different words. Anna Kendrick's screeching voice is understood by crows. Two princes rolled around on rocks singing "Agony," and I thought, "This movie is agony and painful." Some other character later sang about a nightmare, and I couldn't have said it any better. Before seeing the movie, I read reviews that this was a movie for children and adults of all ages. I have to disagree. What was inappropriate were the sexual connotations, violence (e.g. cutting off toes and a heel of two girls, then blinding the two characters), and the death of some beloved characters. (If the cow could be resurrected, why not the decent dead characters?) Rapunzel and her prince could have been cut out of the movie. They were of no importance to the story. Johnny Depp played the same creepy role like he did in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," and Anna Kendrick as Cinderella was confusing.And now for the length of the movie: "Into the Woods" goes on and on and on . . . Right when you think it is over and everyone lives happily ever after - WAIT! you're only half way through; there is still another hour of agony to go.I don't want to give away any of the "good" parts, so I will leave it at this suggestion: Don't waste your money or two hours of your life seeing this, and please don't take your children!

It really makes me angry when people complain about a movie being a MUSICAL after they go see it. Look it up before you pay money to see it!!! It's a popular Broadway production! It's honestly your fault if you go pay money for it without even finding out what it is about and whether it's appropriate for children. That's on you. It's not the film preview's job to tell you if your 6 year old can see it; they're trying to sell a movie. If I worked at that theater that you were "demanding a refund" from, I would tell you where to stick your ticket.Now that we've established that, let me say a few words about the film. Only people who have seen the actual Broadway production should be reviewing this film. If you have a problem with the music, take it up with Stephen Sondheim because it comes from the musical as I have said before. A film adaptation is obviously not going to compare to a live production so get over that, there is just not enough time and it's a different format. But, as far as adaptations go, they did change quite a bit and I'll attribute that to Disney being behind this film and trying to market it to that audience. Believe it or not they had to cut a lot to make it more family friendly and people are still complaining about it. The original production is obviously not owned by Disney and is much darker therefore I was surprised that Disney even wanted to make this film and market it to their brainwashed Frozen-loving happily ever after followers.So if you are thinking about watching this film, get this in your head: This is not a happy fairytale and not a family-centric film. It's always been for adults. It's ironic and has dark humor in it and that's what it's known for (and why I love it), but at the end of the day there's a beautiful message in it that no life is perfect like the fairy tales we're used to. The music is clever and beautiful, the acting is very well done (Emily Blunt was my favorite), there's humor, and it's a tribute to the much darker Grimm Brothers version of these fairy tales and of course the musical. I enjoyed it and if you enjoy musicals, comedy, fairy tales, have an open mind, and are an adult I think you will too.

I came eagerly to the theater to see this intriguing cast in a movie together and wondered how all these fairy tales would be woven together. I had forgotten this movie is an adapted stage musical, yet I enjoy that style of performance. I thought the music was very good throughout, especially the songs performed by Meryl Streep and the two children who all sang well and appropriately "over the top". The two princes singing their duet on the waterfall cracked everybody up. It was so unexpectedly hysterical. It made me wish the whole movie was like that, but it wasn't. Much of the story was very troubled and dark and very uneven in tone. The story had the thread running through of the witch's bargain with the baker and his wife, and it made sense for all of the fairy tale stories to run next to their's, yet something seemed to be missing or not right about it all and the part involving Rapunzel was somewhat boring. After the witch's sudden departure more stories erupted, so the thread was lost and scattered and then brought back to a rather strange end where a sense of extreme loss for every character would be more natural than the tender bonding by a bunch of unrelated characters which took place rather too quickly. Examining the uneven qualities, in part it seemed because of a Cinderella who was so conflicted and serious, and yet had the magic of talking to and commanding birds? The Baker and his wife were mostly serious and nothing bizarre about them other than having a blue-haired witch for a neighbor. The stepmother, step sisters and the princes never seemed very serious as real characters even when horribly blinded or having a toe or heel cut off! I guess fairy tales are bizarre and can be ghastly as well, in which case this fairy tale was no different. Scariest characters for me: The Wolf and Prince Charming (both as lechers in the woods). Funniest characters: The two princes while singing together and chasing their damsels, and Red Riding Hood. Best at emotional pull: The Witch, The Baker, Jack. I wasn't feeling as much as I should have for Cinderella or the Baker's wife, but I really wanted to. Overall this was good entertainment, but it defies my understanding of a tragedy or comedy. I am not used to so much of both elements in one story. Certainly it fared well as a musical, however not with tunes that stuck in my head after leaving the theater.

A wretched musical with rotten musical score, plot befitting a porno, and only one scene with character development. Maybe the special effects were OK if you go to movies just for special effects. The all-star cast were given roles without sufficient emotional depth to allow them to be authentic. From the start, the musical phrases are trite and awkward, no doubt partly because there is not much to sing about other than 'going into the woods' which apparently is supposed to have some metaphorical significance that doesn't really develop. The whole thing reminds me a lot of the old Wizard of Oz yellow brick road trip. This was a waste of money and 2 hours of life.p.s. If you knew me, you would know just how awful a movie would have to be to move me to register for IMDb to write a review -- and this movie crossed that line very early on in the two hour ordeal. It's badness is epic. It fails to entertain. The trailers should have just shown people singing boring music, because that's all this show is about. If you see good reviews on here, trust me they are not from general movie-going public, probably they are shills with some interest in this movie's success. And don't fall for the Emperor's New Clothes line of how ignorant the bad reviews are -- this movie is unforgettable, and that is a bad thing.

I went to the advance screening of this movie last night. I have to say I was very impressed. Normally all these movies are all the same and have been done so many times. The story line wasn't original (cloverfield) However the way the movie was made was amazing. Throughout the movie you will experience all emotions. I think each part was played very very and every character has some impact on the movie. Joel courtney played the main character Joe lamb. You feel attached to this character throughout the movie and experience all his emotions with him. Abrams tried to build suspense by keeping the audience from knowing what is actually going on. It sort of works, however its not too hard to guess. I would recommend going to see this movie and experience it in the cinema. The last 15 mins where a bit cheesy and weren't as good as the first hour and 45mins. If the ending was better without the cheese, I would of given this movie 10 out of 10.

JJ Abrams has created a terrifying and beautiful nostalgic film,exceeding expectations with the thought would come out of the theater, the entire film is a beautiful reminder of the movies that we liked children (ET, The Goonies) but without making it too Creating a great balance between nostalgia and variety in the script, so far the best movie of the year. since started the movie and sees the boy (joe) is there a little memory of Elliot (ET) to advance a little, see a bit of melancholy for his lost family, until there is very little digestible movie until boom shocking scene happens train with what you really feel it's there dodging debris and running around the place and suddenly you see joe in front of a moving wagon followed by a door covering the angle of what comes out, what adds great flavor to curious that came out of there, little by little strange events happen that make you wonder what kind of thing you can do it, dogs running around outside everywhere, strange attacks, people vanishing and machinery stolen happens very creepy scene in which you want to cover your eyes and leave the room, it explores the perspective of the curious and innocent children like "THE GOONIES"but with some guidance from JJ Abrams mystery type, hence all the people begin to ask as much as your passing, we note that the military people say little lamb and the officer will resolve this with their own hands, much like a father who seeks the truth only to forget the death of his wife while Children make their own in search of truth, the creature is really cool . the end of the movie leaves a sour taste in mouth and not tell it for obvious reasons, when they start feeling the sensations such credits have been in the movie. the whole movie is a reminder of Steve Jobs with a great work of JJ undoubtedly worth paying for this masterpiece

Super 8 is nice movie with awesome cinematography and superb editing and a very interesting story which centers group of children in 1979 who are filming and something very unexpected happens. Super 8 might be the best summer movie of 2011 but who knows there are many other titles coming which of course I have not seen. JJ Abrams sure is a nice director. The suspense of the movie is extreme at some points and the sound effects make it even intense.Performance by the entire cast is OK and the script/dialogue/story is pretty genuine and the movie looks like very REAL and you are compelled to believe it.Cinematography is another very positive point of the movie and the scenes really take you 30 years back.Original Score is nice too.IMO the movie will enjoy excellent critic/public/award response this year. and business will be good as well.9/10.

I was lucky enough to get to see Super 8 today at an advanced screening. I'd been excited for J. J. Abram's latest for months, but the result even exceeded my expectations. The secrecy of what happens to our group of middle schoolers is part of the film's appeal, so I won't spoil it. However, I will say that the first 4/5 of this film are an incredibly entertaining homage to the monster movies of the past. There's even mention of the Soviets invading! Real movie magic is created, kicked off by a breath-taking train crash sequence. Most of the middle school kids' performances are passable, but Elle Fanning stands out. She looks far older than she actually is, and acts as such. Her performance outshines even the adults around her. Unexpected humor is also present in the conversations that our heroes have. The wondrous, childlike aura of the film (and its ending) are expected from Spielberg, and it plays out a bit like ET + War of the Worlds + Cloverfield. This is a minor drawback, as the film focuses on the kids for the majority of its running time before suddenly switching gears at the end. Also, several plot lines, including the mother of our protagonist, run a little flat before they can fully develop. These problems being addressed, the ending doesn't quite live up to the extraordinarily high standards the rest of the film sets. It's not terrible, though! There is nothing else negative I can say about Super 8. It's hilarious, touching, scary, imaginative, and fun. And SO WELL EXECUTED. J. J. clearly knows how to make a movie, even if his writing isn't necessarily perfect. Without the few plot problems, Super 8 would be an Oscar contender. Unfortunately, I think that the Academy will look at Super 8 as nothing but above average summer fare. I will be seeing it again, however. And maybe again.

I was fortunate enough to see a screening this morning in DC. I had pretty high hopes for it from what I saw from the trailers. I don't lean one way or the other when it comes to Abrams, some of his stuff I like, some of it I don't. Super 8 is one that I loved. In the current era of CGI laden, soul-dead adventure flicks, Super 8 distinguishes itself by having heart. There is an authenticity to those kids in the film, a familiarity in their conversations. It reminded me of when I was a kid. It was like ET meets Goonies meets The Sandlot. And the film that they are trying to make within the film, and their obsession with "production values" draws a lot of laughs. The friendship between the kids in the film really resonates, and the emotional elements of the film totally deliver. One of the most poignant scenes in the film has nothing to do with whats in the train car, or the air force, and anything like that....rather, its a scene that takes place in Joe's bedroom as he sits on the floor talking to Alice. Now, as much as I loved the film, it is not without some flaws, mostly in continuity. Also, I would have liked a little more exposition for some of the characters, I would love to know more about Alice's father. That being said, I am forgiving on those things because the movie hits its mark everywhere else. Surely it will draw its comparisons to ET, and the other early Spielberg works, but those comparisons will always be unfair. Those films came at a different time. And the people who see Super 8 today, have changed since they first saw ET, or any of those other films. I am just glad the generation of younger people will have this as a generational film for them, as I had with those other great adventure films. All in all, Super 8 was a terrific film experience, that will leave you with a smile on your face.

Simple words! It's a film with heart, which takes us encounter something that we have avoided feeling lately: like a child! Great acting, good script and a big heart like a long time not seen in a movie, this masterpiece is all that we would want it to be, but we're afraid to feel. Forget the brain at home and let your imagination be the vehicle that takes you along with this story of friendship! Congratulations JJ and Spelberg for reminding us why we all love the movies!

This director's 'Star Trek' made for great entertainment and a movie (not film) that I absolutely loved. Sorry, but I can't say the same for this one. The first hour or so sets up some very intriguing major dramatic questions and really pique the audience's interest. Unfortunately the payoffs to most of the setups are a bit weak, except for the resolution to the big question, and that payoff is flat out puny, bordering on ridiculous. In recent interviews Abrams has proudly cited the films that inspired this one and the evidence as to which ones they are is in full display very soon after Joe, our young protagonist (a stellar performance by newcomer Joel Courtney)is introduced and continue throughout. Joe's relationship with Alice (an astonishing Elle Fanning) is the ONE thing in this movie that rings absolutely true. They are wonderful together. Other than that the rest of the movie is a series of rehashed set pieces that do not engage us so much emotionally but rather ask us to sit and take in a tonally uneven and bland mash-up of what has come before and was done better. Not good, not bad, but if you're looking for an exciting time at the movies this summer, look elsewhere.

As the marketing and hype started to build for Super 8, I decided to try my best to not watch any real trailers or promos for the film. It was a difficult task, but somehow I managed to pull off allowing the film to be a mystery leading into its release. When I got the opportunity to see the film in advance fell into my lap, I did not second guess the hype – I ran to the theatre as fast as I could. Taking place in the summer of 1979, Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) is part of an atypical group of friends making a film to enter into a local film festival. While shooting on a train platform late one night, the group witnesses a horrific train crash. They survive the mysterious crash, and do not think much of it. But then strange things begin happening in the town, and the US military suddenly shows up to clean up the damage, not to mention some bizarre things are being recovered from the crash.I already feel like I have said too much regarding about Super 8, but my enthusiasm for this ridiculously well done film is too hard to contain. Abrams, alongside producer and obvious inspiration Steven Spielberg, has crafted something both special and truly extraordinary. What is on the outside a very keenly and nostalgically made film about the loss of innocence and the wonder of personal discovery, is also a period picture examining a time when the slightest enigmatic occurrence could lead to an accusation of Soviet invasion. Many will instantly equate the film to the early work of Spielberg himself (not only because of the various homages), but this is a film that was never meant to draw such easy comparisons.With Super 8, Abrams has matured into a great filmmaker who is very quickly on their way to becoming a master of the craft. He tenderly embraces the format of a monster movie and the hard lessons behind growing up (not unlike Joe Cornish's significantly grittier Attack the Block), and never lets either get too far ahead of itself. While it can be thrilling and fused with electric intensity, it can also be very tender and moving. We know the focus is on these adorable, wide-eyed kids, but Abrams invests enough time into the adult characters like Kyle Chandler's Deputy Jackson Lamb and Louis Dainard, played by the obscenely underrated Ron Eldard as well. By doing this, he allows the audience to follow in the wonder of the children's vague cluelessness of the hell that is going on around them, and the adults trying to unravel the mystery. He also lets the script speak for itself, directing the increasing action brilliantly and allowing the actors to truly become the characters they are playing. I just hope he quickly realizes his stylish use of lens flare is beginning to border a little too close to overbearing.Acting wise, the film fires on all cylinders. Chandler and Eldard are excellent in their fatherly roles, as is Noah Emmerich's absolutely despicable Nelec. But the show is completely stolen far and away by the children. This is really their movie, and they shine in each of their scenes. Casting relative unknowns in the majority of these roles, not least Courtney in the lead, helps give an enhanced sense of authenticity and fascination. The looks of fear, confusion, sadness and fun are real in the most flattering way possible. There is not one instance where any of these kids look like they are acting against a green-screen, or acting on a set. They act like seasoned veterans, and will surprise you consistently from the opening frame right until the end of the credits. Special mention also goes to Elle Fanning, who is rapidly proving to be a formidable talent who might be even stronger than her famous sister Dakota.While I will not give away too many specific details, I can say the special effects should already be considered an early front runner for the best of the year. The train crash sequence involves some of the most incredibly and intensely depicted images of destruction I have ever seen. You will be on the edge of your seat unable to look away from just how amazingly realistic it all looks. With Super 8, the visual effects are taken to the extreme, and look absolutely astounding every time they are employed. Without ruining anything else, I can safely say you will be both terrified and awestruck by just how much effort was put into making these effects look so realistic.If I hold anything against the film, it is the finale. The film is brilliantly paced and the tone is never taken for granted, but it just comes off a bit odd when compared to the rest of the film. It is not as disappointing as some may have you believe, but it was a bit too soft and cuddly for my liking – a little bit too close to what Spielberg would have done. We know the film is a nostalgic homage to those films that so many of us remember watching on weekends as kids, but the ending just does not jive as well as it could have. It feels like Abrams just did not want to commit to anything darker, and just went with the safest route he could think of. If you are still reading this review and can see Super 8 now, than you have made a big mistake. With only his third film, Abrams has made a truly spectacular must-see film that demands to be seen as quickly as possible. Allowing some of the surprises to be spoiled is simply not an option. This is the best film of the summer thus far, and will be remembered well into the end of the year. 9/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).

If there's one movie you shouldn't miss this year, it's Super 8. There's more heart and soul in it's two hour running time than most mainstream movies could ever hope to conjure. It's the kind of film that reminds you of why you go to the movies.Reviewing a film like Super 8 isn't easy, there's simply too much material to cover and there is the delicate problem of giving too much away. Director JJ Abrams has gone to great lengths to keep the plot of his movie a secret, so much so that the film's resulting low profile may hurt it's box office take. He's the master of what he calls the "Mystery Box", he doesn't want to tell you what's in it, but he sure as hell wants you to enjoy opening it.The film is set in a small Ohio town in 1979, complete with bad fashion, hairstyles, and fantastic cars. It centres on Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), son of Deputy Sheriff Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler), and the tragic events of that winter and how it changed his life. The film opens with one of the most chilling shots that will stay with you for a long time after the film, it's the kind of story telling you wish you could feel every time you went to the cinema.Four months later and Joe is helping his friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) finish a super 8 movie for an upcoming film competition, much to the displeasure of his disconnected father Jackson. Charles has managed to convince Alice (Elle Fanning), an older girl whom Joe likes to play a part in his movie. All chuffed and excited they sneak out at night with their firiends Carey (Ryan Lee), Preston (Zach MIllso), and Martin (Gabriel Basso) to film a scene.While filming they witness a shocking crash, their high school science teacher driving his pickup truck onto the train tracks and smashing directly into an oncoming train. The heavily injured teacher, gun in hand, tells them to go and tell no one or they and their parents will die. It's a bit dramatic, but the swarming men in military uniforms convince the children to make a run for it and vow never to tell anyone that they were there.What follows is like a cross between The Goonies and E.T., and it doesn't fail to deliver. It's on the one hand a coming age story and on the other it's about dealing with grief. It's funny, scary, cheesy, and delightful all at the same time. The young and unknown cast are fantastic, they look comfortable and completely natural, with special mention to Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning (sister of Dakota Fanning). Those two are mesmerizing sharing much of the more touching moments of the film, especially Fanning who has a very commanding presence for her age.It's not without it's problems true, Abrams must suffer from ADHD because he seems to love to blow things up even when it doesn't really make sense to. He's also a bit clumsy with some of the dialogue, but it's excusable because the rest of the film exudes a charisma I wish other Directors could master. I also think he's yet to master the elusive art of timing, particularly during the film's climax. He lacks a sense of pace when the plot demands it, and he under plays some action while overplaying others.There has also been some debate over the ending, but I think it's perfect, I think it's easy to forget what this film is really about, which might be the fault of the film itself. But you only need to listen to Abrams tell you that "Jaws isn't about a shark" or "E.T. isn't about an Alien" (here) to see that he wants to tell a story that's very human and with a lot of heart.Super 8 is an Abrams "Mystery Box" complete with a satisfying unveiling of the goodies inside. It's the best movie so far of 2011, and it's a real treat. You do not want to miss it!

My major problem with Super 8 is not with the unremarkable cast or with the cheesy attempts at tension. It's not that it's "slow" or poorly paced for a summer film. If I had to sum it up with a word, I'd say coldness, maybe carelessness. How about dreary? How can anyone enjoy bad dialogue and poor pacing if they don't care for the characters? The execution was palatable but you simply didn't care about anyone or anything that was going on. This is slasher film quality without the slashing. It's just a poor story and a poor effort by all involved.Without a doubt this film going to be the quintessential "hype over substance" film we all reference for years to come. The mystique, marketing and mystery leading up to release was bigger than what we actually see on screen. This overrated film has done nothing but hide behind big names to draw a big opening weekend at the box office. It wanted to be another "Signs" type drama but all it delivers is disappointment.Forget "Signs" this movie was like combining M. Night Shyamalan's "The Happening" and Spielberg's "War of The Worlds." Not exactly a winning combination despite the hype. I'll give the creator's of this film a pass because they usually deliver but the sooner we all forget about this mess and J.J. moves on to the Star Trek sequel the better.

In the 70s a boy's mother is killed during a factory accident. The boy is Joe (Joel Courtney) and rallying around him are his young friends, led by Charles (Riley Griffiths). Charles is making a low budget horror movie with them on his super 8 camera; much to the disapproval of Joes father Jack (Kyle Chandler), the deputy Sheriff. One night Charles invites the group to a late night filming session. He invites along Alice (Elle Fanning) and Joe takes a quiet liking to her. While filming at a train station they try to use an incoming train as a background to the movie. But the train derails and explodes, forcing the kids to run for cover. When they reach the wreckage a dying man points a gun at them, telling them not to talk about anything they've seen. Days later and strange things are occurring in the town, like metal objects disappearing, suggesting that something otherworldly has escaped from the train. It leads to a military intervention on the town, which is disrupting for the filming of the rest of Charles' movie. Alice is also reluctant to come back because of her alcoholic father Louis (Ron Eldard). There are three films being made throughout Super 8 and only two of them work. The kid's amateur horror production and J.J. Abrams' tribute to a young, free generation have a nostalgic quality to them. There's a level of sweetness about the trouble these kids get into and how they interact with each other. The dynamics of the group are sharp. Their interactions are often very funny and their diction is sound. It's very difficult to capture how children speak to each other but here it's authentic. And because of this and the unique personality of each child the scenes with the group are the most enjoyable in the film. This is essentially a picture for anyone who has ever played with monster makeup, fake blood and plastic soldiers. But rather typically, the adults spoil the fun. The studio's vision seems at odds with Abrams'. The film is louder and more inflated than E.T ever could have been. The little guy probably went home so he could hear himself think. Too often there's a lack of restraint here. Take the film's biggest set piece, the train crash. It's deafening and visually striking but it's not enough to simply have the locomotive derail. It also has to be packed with explosives so we can watch it go boom. Then there's the assumption that without caricatures like the pot smoker and the scantily clad rebellious daughter we'd never know the film was set in the 1970s. The clean neighbourhoods and stereotypes make this look like a movie version of the era. It's also the side characters who obstruct the more interesting main story and provide tonal issues too. There's a disjunction between the playfulness of the kids and the square jawed militarism. It's strange that a film so intent on paying homage to B-grade horror compromises itself by being so serious at times. It's unfortunate because of how funny so much of Super 8 is. The amateur film played over the end credits is hysterical. But as the explosive experts take over in the final quarter, the film starts to read from the Jurassic Park Handbook of Escape Routes. Spielberg is one of the film's producers, which also explains why the film is caught in a tug-of-war between being an aggressive monster picture and something more sentimental. At least the film is never dull, courtesy of the fine performances by the kids. They're all very natural and Elle Fanning grows most emotionally here. There's one noted efforts by the adults like Kyle Chander. His character might as well have been called John Law. Lighten up dad. But as the political climate around the US's immigration policies heats up we're likely to see even more films from Hollywood about alien arrivals. Super 8 is an often engaging and entertaining sci-fi entry to this phase, but those looking for a leaner and more sophisticated alien film would do better with the British film from last year, Monsters.

Funny that Abrams is working with Spielberg.....seeing that i consider JJ to be the next Stephen. But has Abrams ever created an idea on his own? Every single movie he has directed has been from someone else's hand. He has proved that he can direct one hell of a movie, but can he create one out of thin air? Remember those old late 70's early 80's kid movies? Ex: "Stand By Me", "Goonies" ext. This movie really strikes a cord with those. Not in the adventure sense, well....that too......but the comparison that i'm trying to make is the overall presence of these main characters and the dialog they exchange with each other. The humorous cussing and funny scenarios....it fits right in with those classic films that we all remember. And it made me think.....Why aren't kids movies like this anymore? It was a nice trip down memory lane for any film geek.As far as story lines, the movie is pretty damn solid. It has that certain Spielberg vibe to it with a little JJ spice thrown in. I mean come on, a bunch of kids filming an amateur zombie flick and witness a train crash carrying contents from Area 51.....you couldn't ask for a better summer movie set-up. But i know most people walking into this will think that everything is about discovering this creature......much like "Stand By Me" with the body, and the treasure with "The Goonies". But if you understand those movies, you will also know that there is a much deeper subtext. With "Super 8", it's got a lot more heart. I wouldn't say it has more heart that "Stand By Me", but it comes pretty damn close, and that in itself is a big compliment.But what really sells this story are the characters. The kids in this crack me up like you wouldn't believe. And oh my god.....Elle Fanning just made her sister look stupid with her talent.But the transitions between the adults and the kids are great. Each one is entertaining, and there is always something physically going on to keep your attention. From beginning to end, the movie does not stop moving.And next we move onto the alien, which i have been dying to see for over a year now. I won't go into too much detail, but it's really similar to the "Cloverfield" monster, just a smaller version. The back story behind this creature is pretty cool, i really wish they could have gone into more detail. They give you enough to wet your hands, but i wanted a full bath. The cool aspect they did with the creature is to the same effect of "Jaws". You don't really see the entire thing until all hell breaks loose, which comes somewhere in the third act.I know most nerds like myself will dislike the ending, but i however enjoyed it. It wasn't cheesy or over the top......it fit nice and snug with the rest of the movie.Bottom Line.....i know it will take a couple of days for this movie to fully sink into my brain, because like i said before, once it starts, it doesn't stop. But judging from what i just experienced, they really don't make summer movies like this anymore. It's a nice trip down memory lane with the nostalgia. The characters are all enjoyable. The Sci-Fi aspect is really cool. The action is top notch. Everything a summer movie should be. I just wish every kids movie was like this......because 20 years ago.....it was.

To be honest I didn't know much about this movie going in and I'm glad I didn't. I didn't expect much either because I thought this was going to be a children's movie since it centers on the kids.The kids are surprisingly well cast. They act like kids their age. Joel Courtney carries the movie well for a boy his age. The rest of the children are a great supporting cast.If I had to complain about some of the performances it would be on some of the adults. At times the children seemed smarter than some of the "grown-ups." Kyle Chandler on the other hand was good, finally see him do some action.The movie is very well made, very well written. I really enjoyed it, I laughed, I gasped, I jumped and I even shed a tear.

I saw this film, careful to go in not knowing too much about it. And it's not my intention to ruin things for anyone else by explaining it all here. This is a great Summer film, and a film with enough explosions and scares to keep a broad audience on their toes. Yet there is a great script, and an original plot that is not that common to the expected Summer Blockbuster.I know the director is keen to point out that it is not a Spielberg homage, but you can not avoid drawing comparisons. However, if you were a painter, would the odd influence or comparison to Da Vinci be all that bad? The influence as I see it, is on great casting, fabulous details in the development of the supporting cast, and a plot that honestly leaves the audience guessing until the final reel. Hats off to the writer/director, and hopefully he wont mind passing a little of this appreciation on to the Executive Producer.

The first indication that this is a throwback and homage to science fiction of the 70s and 80s, is the Amblin logo that came up at the start. After all, Steven Spielberg had given the world Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and ET, two major alien films that had strong characterization and a compelling storyline filled with plenty of human drama, compared to these days when the attention is all focused on who can come up with the baddest looking aliens that can wreck havoc on Earth. Even Spielberg himself had a go with the modern update to War of the Worlds that failed to capture the charm of his earlier sci-fi films.So he took on the producing role, partnering with J.J. Abrams who took on writing and directing responsibilities for Super 8, in what I would deem very ET like, except for the fact that the alien encounter is anything but friendly to a certain extent, more like District 9 style where us humans basically like to, as far as the movies go, enslave anything that falls down from the sky, sending in the military might to overpower, and like Paul said it, exploiting all alien technology and capability before sending them for a lobotomy and autopsy. In case you're wondering, no this is not a Cloverfield prequel or sequel, since the net was abuzz with such speculation given its teasing trailer, and Abrams' own credits as producer of Matt Reeves' film.The story has to be kept under wraps, so what I'll do is to fawn over what worked. There will be quarters who may find it a tad too convenient in the way it ended, but I thought that simplicity is beauty - too often these days we're looking for that surprise ending or smart alecky gimmick, that something so effectively bringing the curtains down on a thrill ride get frowned upon, which is a pity because in essence the film reminds us of the days gone where such tricks need not be resorted to, so long as one had a solid story to tell, which is what Super 8 has in abundance in weaving closed loops in its narrative threads, with mystery, action, drama and romance all rolled into one superb summer blockbuster package.Then there's the casting of relative unknowns, and children at that, who did such a superb job they put their older, seasoned counterparts in the industry to shame. We don't see too many films these days where the protagonists are a group of children embarking on that huge adventure, or in this instance, indulging in their passion for, filmmaking! There's portly Charles (Riley Griffiths) the director and writer, his best chum Joe (Joel Courtney) the makeup artist who both have the same crush over their leading lady Alice (Elle Fanning) to form one romantic angle, and not forgetting lead actor Martin (Gabriel Basso), cameraman Preston (Zach Mills) and pyrotechnics and effects specialist Cary (Ryan Lee), all sharing incredible chemistry together as a team working toward a common goal in making a short film in their small town, only to stumble upon an aged old military secret that threatens their way of life.Adequately peppered with comedy balanced with that sense of mystery and tension throughout, J.J. Abrams leaves you consistently wanting more, feeding off nuggets of minute information bits that he reveals a little at a time. I thoroughly appreciated how everything need not be spelt out in verbose, allowing emotions to come through more genuinely as you feel for the characters involved, though leaving the pieces of the puzzle simple enough for anyone to put them all together. Then there's the tease of not showing you the threat, leaving things for the most parts to your imagination, before the inevitable show hand.Action sequences are what you'd come to expect from a summer film, with the tent pole being the spectacular train crash sequence that began with the little filmmakers wanting a little added production value to their film, which in itself - the train rolling by; anyone who had experienced something similar would attest to that relatively nerve wrecking moment - giving way to a larger scale disaster that made it literally rain metal. Other action moments weren't as big scaled as this one was, though no less crafted with subtlety that demonstrated some degree of confidence not to overindulge in the need for special effects shots, again adding to the mystique that the children and their town had to face.But credit will have to go to the trio of Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths and Elle Fanning, who all did such a great job to anchor their roles. Dakota will probably be looking over her shoulders given her sister's performance in this film, while I'm pretty sure offers will start knocking on the doors of Joel and Riley as the next potential child actors that we will see more of in time to come, who together with the rest of the young cast had the weight of this film carried on their shoulders, if the film were to succeed it will have to depend on the believability of their banter, antics and chemistry, which as mentioned, were really excellent.Oh and don't head out the door once the end credits start to roll, especially if you're curious to know how the group's short film actually turned out to be. Easily one of the best, and potentially the favourite scene of many. At least I know it is for me! Highly recommended, and it waltzes its way into contention to be amongst the best this year had to offer.

Super 8 is a film that I wanted to like, whose characters I wished I cared about, but whose thorough preposterousness (the fault of persistent lapses in logic stemming from graceless, hurried set-up) crippled any possibility for real, enthusiastic engagement. It requires incredible suspension of disbelief in terms of both its basic plot/story structure, and – more damagingly – its young characters' relationships.Emotionally, the film hinges on Joel's attachment to his mother, who recently passed away. Without this grief, there effectively is no story, no emotional conflict. And yet, the emotional and familiar trauma is established so quickly and so bluntly, the death is wholly instrumentalized – bypassing any kind of emotional affection it might have elicited, and emerging simply, and transparently, as a plot requirement. So much of the first hour of the film feels this way: from Alice's introduction, Joel's reaction to finding out that she's joining the cast, to they way the characters are introduced (via a few shorthand traits), and their faux-slice-of-life style of interacting with one another. Abrams has a way of both writing and directing 'on the nose' – telling and showing us (via dialog, visual cues, etc) exactly what we need to know when we need to know it, without art or subtlety. Instead of slowly discovering these characters, their relationships with one another, with their families, others, and the town itself, the exposition is dealt with rapid-fire, most often through shots and dialog that render the characters' feelings and ideas unmistakable. In this way, the machinations of the set-up are all-too-visible; rarely does a moment pass in the first half of the film in which some element is not made transparently and immediately visible as simply a plot or character 'requirement' that demanded setting up.Alice, emerging as if from a social void, quickly becomes friends with Joel, Charles, and the gang after the night of the train crash; from here, Joel and Alice's relationship begins to take shape. Abrams deserves some credit. There are moments in the film of beauty and authenticity, however, Super 8's tendency toward rote sentimentalizing coupled with its dependence on unlikely timing and chance, often deadens their effect. Take a scene in Joel's bedroom: a few shining lines of emotionally authentic dialog between Alice and Joel is undermined by the fundamental unlikeliness of everything about the scene.The film insists on getting to its proverbial feet too quickly. However, once it does begin to act on the plot and character situation it has so deliberately set-up, the machinations to some degree recede into the body of the film, and things run more smoothly – even if the film never relinquishes its fundamental reliance on the preposterous by way of the literal. The monster set-pieces are consistently entertaining – even when the relationships are at their most blunt – and the stakes amp up as things move along. The timing remains always just right, and everyone is always in the right place at the right time.Visually, the film operates at, really, only two levels, vacillating between incredibly shallow DOF close and medium close shots of characters and objects, and CGI wide shots (of the town, the train, a bus in the woods, etc). Visually, the film is at its most interesting in those rare moments when it takes a step back, brings everything into focus, and shows us the characters in relation to the town around them. But, due to the paucity of such shots, there's never any real sense of space (or place), which greatly inhibits the ability of the film to sustain atmosphere (for, in an adventure scenario, the ambiance of spaces is critical). However, for the characters to plausibly move from location to location as they do, seemingly able to get from any one point in the town to any other in a matter of minutes, the shallow focus c.u. is an all important tool.The kids' reactions to the explosions, mayhem, and general disorder that so often surrounds them tends to be closer to that of spectators, awed but abstracted (like the cinema audience itself), than of real human beings in imminent peril. As they run from tanks and explosions, we hear exclamations of "Whoa! That was crazy! Did you see that?" Even within the diegesis the kids seem positioned more as spectators than actors in the environment, emerging always unscathed with no more than the most superficial marks (with small scrapes, covered in a film of dirt).This point, however, returns us to one of the film's central fissures. What is required by the plot takes precedence over what is plausible in the world the film has set up. In all, the film too often feels rote, flat. It hits the proper notes, but artlessly – without having effectively or convincingly established this world, these characters, and the situation they're in enough for the spectacle to amount to much. The confrontation with the monster/alien is ultimately trite and mostly unsatisfying: following in the footsteps of its cinematic forebears, the film humanizes the life-form, yet without expending much energy toward allowing us to understand its plight, preferring to take care of all that more efficiently, via some perfunctory audio-tape exposition from Dr. Woodward.The film has its pleasures, and at least a handful of shining, beautiful little moments. We care enough about the characters, despite the too-often-thin material with which they're provided, to engage with the action/horror/danger set pieces; in general, the pure cinematic thrills of the monster-centered sequences are enough to carry us through the film (via the mostly expert sound design and effective staging). Ultimately, however, as an evocation of childhood adventure, friendship and first love, it doesn't hold up – committed only (and misguidedly) to getting the surface details/plot highlights right, putting to screen its abbreviated, summary version, but failing to either atmospherically or narratively convey the depth (emotionally or spatially) and textural richness a successful characterization would require.

As you might expect, J. J. Abrams has churned out another exhilarating experience with solid entertainment. Imagine, if you will, a combination of The Goonies + Cloverfield and you will get Super 8, the story of a young boy and his friends that witness a creature escaping a crashed military train while filming with a super 8 camera. As I heard an audience member say after the screening, J. J. Abrams put his fingerprint on this movie, then smeared it all over. The mysterious creature is only glimpsed a handful of times during the first half of the film, and the story will keep you constantly guessing and engaged. With the aid of some fantastic special effects, Super 8 will no doubt be one of the most exciting films of this summer, additionally offering a nostalgic reminder of the times of Spielberg's E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. So the bottom line is: Super 8 is good, and if you're watching it as a J. J. Abrams fan, you're in for a real treat.But the film is not without its flaws. Within this young cast you can sense a lot of rising stars but that's just it. They're still "rising". It is a common problem to have some amateur acting with kids. The story is not entirely original either. However, these are only minor complaints against the movie. The main issue with Super 8 is that it can't decide what it wants to be. Is it a coming-of-age drama? Is it an alien action film? Is it horror mystery? Alien and horror and mystery genres can mix quite nicely, but unfortunately coming-of-age not so much. One aspect of the film focuses on the adventure of kids in a rural town while another focuses on a violently rampaging alien. The result is a schizophrenic jumble of genres that has you shifting uncomfortably in your seat at the idea of kids watching certain scenes. For this reason, I STRONGLY caution adults taking their kids to see this movie. Super 8 had more blood, cursing, and blatant drug references than any movie I have seen in a while. IT's a bit like walking into Kick-ass expecting a child's movie. In my honest opinion Super 8 should have been rated R, but Abrams was careful when pushing the limits of PG-13 rules. Indeed, this movie was a wonderful throwback to the days of E.T., but perhaps should only be viewed by those who watched E.T. when it came out. Don't forget that the Abrams touch is violent, as well as mysterious! 8/10

"Super 8" takes us back to the glorious days of Spielberg treats like "The Goonies", "E.T. The Extraterrestrial", and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". Indeed, written and directed by Jeffrey Jacob Abrams, "Super 8" is a collaboration between Abrams and Steven Spielberg who serves as producer.As a teenager, Abrams' film-making exploits caught Spielberg's eye and it earned him a gig restoring Spielberg's own 8mm movies. And if, after viewing the movie, you thought that this is Abrams' homage to Spielberg, Abrams has denied it, saying (in an interview) that "It was never intended as homage to him, but really to that period of my life, which was really the first impulse of this movie." For many, "Super 8" will also remind them of their own childhood adventures and maybe even their first love.During the summer of 1979, a group of school friends led by aspiring director Charles (Riley Griffiths) and make-up trainee Joe (Joel Courtney) are making a zombie movie in a small town in Ohio when they witness a catastrophic train crash. The boys, and their volunteer actress Alice (Elle Fanning), soon suspect that there is more to the accident than meets the eye. Soon people and dogs go missing, and violent, inexplicable events begin to take place in town. And as the US military arrive, Joe's dad Jackson (Kyle Chandler), the local Deputy Sheriff, tries to uncover the truth - which turns out to more terrifying than any of them could have imagined.The first thing I noticed about "Super 8" is how the young cast, led by Dakota Fanning's sister Elle, draw us into their movie-within-a-movie. Fanning's Alice may be talented and pretty and the romantic interest of the boys around her, but she is the gutsiest among the kids. Needless to say, she grabs our attention whenever she is on-screen - as do the other youngsters as they strive to make sense of what is happening from the events captured on the Super 8 camera.The movie may deal with an alien 'invasion' but it is mainly about that time when American adolescents learn about friendship, loyalty, survival and love. Joe, the protagonist, has admired Alice from a distance and boy, does he revel in the chance to touch her face - while doing her make-up. These 'soft' scenes are interspersed with hard-core action sequences like the train crash and the devastation by the alien (which looks quite like the monster from Alien). It is to Abrams' credit that he has resisted the temptation to give audiences a proper view of the 'extra-terrestrial'. Anyway, sustaining curiosity is Abrams' forte, having created TV's "Lost" and "Fringe" series.Among the adult cast are Noah Emmerich, who plays the nasty military commander, and Ron Eldard as Alice's father. They put up credible performances but it is a pity to see them upstaged by the outstanding young cast. Bravo to the youngsters. - (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)

A friend won two tickets to an advanced screening of this movie last night - so this review is done from the perspective of having watched it for free. :) There are a lot of great things about this movie: The special effects are excellent without being gratuitous. In other words, the special effects enhance the story as opposed to BEING the story. The child actors do a great job of having their own personalities and really portraying the fun that kids have at that age. It does a good job of not making the adults out to be idiots (as so many movies do with child actors) but at the same time the adults have their own weaknesses. I felt connected to all the characters internal struggles. There is a good amount of tension throughout the first half of the movie, including several scenes that make you "jump". There are also several scenes that made me laugh so despite the tension, it never felt heavy.The bad: The ending was disappointingly predictable. There were a couple moments of, "There is no way a middle school kid would do that."In the end, I was glad to watch the movie but I don't think I'll be seeing it again. If you're looking for a good popcorn movie with a decent story, this is it. If you're hoping to see a movie that will leave you thinking about it for days, I would look elsewhere.

The concept was interesting but the surrounding story is borderline inept. There's something missing from the heart of Super 8 for which no amount of quality cinematography, editing, and acting can substitute. I'm not saying the acting was good. What I'm saying is that Super 8 is an insanely uninteresting and almost unlikable film. Devoid of any thriller resonance, the movie treats intrigue the way porn movies treat sex, as a subject to be exploited. The script matches mass childish mystery with awful dialogue and lame performances, using a thin plot as an excuse to try and keep the audience. Unless your IQ matches your show size, there was really nothing of intrigue. I can't tell you how disappointing I am in this movie.I wanted to be scared but just wasn't. I wanted to like this movie and buy in to the ride but I just didn't. Huge let down.

Super 8 appears to be J.J. Abrams' way of paying his respects to Steven Spielberg. I was steadily reminded of E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind throughout this film. The community kids are the first to discover the strange things happening around town, are almost always the only witnesses to important events, and repeatedly run into the adults who just don't understand.An article in this week's New York Times magazine describes how a young J.J. Abrams got a job repairing and editing Steven Spielberg's old Super 8 films. That is a great memory to start your new screenplay with. Five pre-teen kids in an out of the way, small Ohio town are making a zombie movie on a Super 8. The boss kid is the director and persistently updating screenwriter. There is also the nervous lead actor, the kid obsessed with explosives who plays the zombie, and our film's main character, the make-up artist who is also adept at model trains and airplanes. While sneaking out at night to work on their movie with a newly recruited girl in their mix, the kids witness a train derailment and so begins the mystery.I will reveal nothing about the train, what was on it, and what happens after that. Would you have wanted the answer to everything about E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind before seeing them? No way. Just know that this is not a movie just for the kids. There are genuinely suspenseful moments, a lot of pre-teen cursing, drug use, some quality horror gore, and an overall tight story. It is very refreshing to see a summer movie which is not a franchise continuing sequel or about a new superhero. These kids are real and there small town adventure mystery is well worth it.

The nostalgic trailer of Super 8 Directed by J. J. Abrams is reminiscent of E.T. and Cloverfield. The movie is a cocktail of sci-fi, comedy, family, romance, friendship, teenage growth, monsters and zombies. If you expect to watch a monster movie, you may be thrilled by the second half but disappointed by the first half as it slightly drags. If you intend to watch a family drama, it may not be a great success as the relationships between the fathers and their kids can be further developed.What surprises me most is that the children are perfectly cast. Joel Courtney is adorable and Elle Fanning, with her nuanced facial expressions, brings the audience one of the most engaging moments when her character acts as a detective's wife in a train station. While the two leads have a great chemistry, their friends are hilarious. It is also amusing to look at the adult world through the children's eyes. For instance, the kids act as a soldier, a zombie, a boss, etc. There is a thought provoking scene in which a boy's leg is injured because of a bomb explosion while the kids are still in costume and make-up. When the "war" becomes real, the kids are forced to grow up hastily. Indeed, Super 8 can be viewed as a coming-of-age comedy.The movie emphasizes the importance of letting go. Make sure you stick around during the closing credits. This is probably the BEST part of the movie.

I saw this film at a screening tonight, and I must say it's the most disjointed film I've seen so far this year.First off, I have no complaints about the actors. In fact, the actors kind of reminded me of what Goonies could possibly look like in the 21st century. Okay, the actors are fine. So far, so good.The movie goes off the rails midway through it; precisely when the alien storyline comes to the fore. While this particular storyline isn't that bad initially, it wears out its welcome in a hurry, especially when it all comes together. I don't think I'm spoiling much by saying that there isn't much to it.Quite frankly, I think that Abrams' love of Spielberg's previous films has prevented him from actually making this his own film. It could also be because Spielberg produced the film, meaning it would require his stamp of approval in order for the movie to be released. A shame really, because if Abrams did it his way, he would have made a better movie than 'Cloverfield'.Don't expect to have the same wonderment that you get from Spielberg films, however. You can tell those moments were merely tacked-on to fit the 'Spielberg' mould. Anyone who's seen the early 80's Spielberg movies knows what I'm talking about.So, with all that being said, what are we left with? The closest analogy would be a chocolate bar with layered and soft caramel on the outside, but a rough, hard to chew toffee middle. As good as the caramel is, the toffee sure makes it hard to swallow.Wait for it on Netflix or your local video store. You'll thank me later.

Something strange is happening in a small town after a train derails . What was supposed to be a nostalgic look at the lives of a few middle schoolers in 1979 turns out to be the biggest movie non event of the year. Something is not right in this movie that fails for three reasons. First, it is entirely too much like the old "Twilight Zone" and "Outer Limits" TV shows. Secondly, the predictability factor manifests itself from the beginning. You know exactly what is going to happen before it even does. You just sit there and viola! It happens. Third is the "Lets use every cliché from every sci-fi movie ever made" factor.Self explanatory. The no name cast doesn't have one character you even care about. They look too clean, too polished,and too plastic just like animatronics at a Disney World attraction.And yes, they all have what I like to call the "Spielberg Look"- you know, that dazed, glazed facial expression that was so prominent in "ET". If this turkey bears a resemblance to "Close Encounters", "War of the Worlds", "ET", "Cloverfield", and "The Goonies", thats the idea. There isn't an original idea anywhere in this mess. Its as if director Abrams was told to make a homage to early Spielberg films by Spielberg himself, and thats exactly what he did. Film does have its moments, but they are few and very far between. Film tries to be nostalgic, but 70s nostalgia? A great decade! Disco, Jimmy Carter, the looming Iran hostage crisis, inflation, oil crisses, unemployment, polyester, etc, etc. Kinda of sounds like today, doesn't it? I can go on and on but, dear reader, I think you get the point. This film has the cheesiest ending since "Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull",and the schmaltz in the last two minutes or so seems to have been applied with a trowel.As is, just alright for eight year old kids or undemanding viewers. However, adults who are looking for something with some brains and intelligence should go to another multiplex. However, you gotta admit that Spielberg is pretty smart. He just bought himself a 300 foot long yacht that cost over 200 million dollars.Mediocrity is its own reward,but to call this film mediocre is to praise it to high heaven. This film represents everything that is wrong with today's filmmaking and movies. Save your 11 bucks and the trip to the multiplex. It will be available on DVD before the summers over.Mark my words, you'll see. PS- "Super 8" refers to a type of 8mm film that was used for making home movies in the pre digital film age.

This movie wants to take you on a ride, it wants to take you back to a time and a place where the world was that little more innocent.This movie wants your heart to skip a beat when danger is near, and wants you to lose your breath when the heroes are in peril. This movie wants to be a lot of things, but ultimately there's just something missing. You feel like a spectator just waiting to get involved, but as the movie creeps along and goes through the motions you begin to realize that the sidelines are as close as you're going to get.There's virtually no back story to what's on board the train and when do finally learn more about it it's then too late to care. The father and son have both been impacted by a traumatic and life-changing event, but aside from a few passing encounters we don't ever really feel their pain. There are some moments in the movie that stir something deeper down, but they're over almost as quickly as they begun and you're back to the bleachers watching a fairly boring, simple story unfold. I think what is at fault here is the plot - it's seemingly non-existent. The director has taken a bunch of things that on their own sound like a great recipe, but some vital magic got missed from the mix and it just never comes together like it should.

To put it bluntly, you expect more from a movie when it's being advertised as a major product of JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg. There were some good one liners in the movie, and I enjoyed the kids, but overall the whole thing was lackluster and I'm still trying to figure out what the climax was supposed to be. Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning along with the other kids in the film were cast well, but their story line alone could have been developed into its own entity (minus the alien). Visually it was pretty good to watch. The train crash was great and I liked the tones used in the film but, beyond that, the most enjoyable part was the sequence played during the credits. If you stay for the whole thing, make sure you tough it out and catch that part.

Although I could create an extensive list of cliché one-liners, obvious inconsistencies, and totally unrealistic occurrences (even for a PG-13 sc-fi movie), the underlying reason that I will influence friends to not see this movie is because the plot was weak and shallow.First of all, there are actually 4 subplots that a viewer has to juggle between!1) A budding romantic relationship between the two main (middle school) characters 2) Mending a tense father-child relationship(s) (also with both main characters) 3) A group of early teens helping the alien return home and... 4) A son finding a way to cope with the loss of his mother *I might not have deemed 4) as a plot line if it wasn't for the intentionally-dramatic "letting the alien take mom's locket" scene as the last scene in the movie*These plots were all given fairly even amounts of attention and while they did have some connecting, because there is not much screen-time or time dedicated to deepen dialogue within the individual plots, they all come off as unimportant.While it does have a fair amount of suspense, the action sequences are typical at best.Overall, just a flat-out poor showing by high profile names (and a $45m budget).Like I mentioned in the beginning sentence, there are so many things that just don't make any sense. But the biggest question I had walking away is why did the Air Force end up killing Dr. Woodward??? There was no reason for his murder whatsoever! (Not considering the fact that he was still alive after a head-on collision with a speeding freight train). It's almost funny how drastic that decision was by the "evil Air Force Sargent," Nelec.

As we grow older and hopefully wiser we seem to look back to our past as "simpler" times. A time of innocence. It is during this "simpler" time, 1979, when Charles (Riley Griffiths) - a want-to-be director, enlists the aid of his junior high friends to make a "Super 8" movie. His dream is to enter his movie in an upcoming contest and of course win fame and fortune. It is during the filming of an all important scene when Joe (Joel Courtney) notices a white pick-up truck enter the path of a speeding freight train. As the kids run for cover, the camera is left running and films the entire crash. The train disaster unleashes a secret that has been kept from the American public since 1958. The arrival of the military and their very hush hush demeanor has the town deputy looking for answers.The group of young filmmakers continue on and when the original role of super 8 film is returned from the lab (remember when you had to wait for film to be developed?), Joe and Charles get a look at why the military has occupied the peaceful burg of Lillian, Ohio.Government conspiracy, man's inhumanity to anything different than ourselves, rivalry between friends, young love and most of all being able to let go of your past to grow and move into the future are all explored during the 112 minute run time.This film is definitely worth a trip to the theater to see on the big screen. The special effects would loose some of their impact - even on those 55" and 60" full HD TV's.The "secret" is kept hidden enough to keep the audience guessing and ads to some "shock" moments that may make you jump.Overall and enjoyable film - rated PG-13 the film could be disturbing to some younger viewers - I recommend you go see this one.

The subject and people behind "Super 8" made me look forward to it very much. I was hoping that it would be like "E.T." and other Steven Spielberg movies. After seeing it, I don't think that its quality matches "E.T.", but it's still good. "Super 8" is directed by J.J. Abrams, and co-produced by Steven Spielberg. It is science fiction, and it has a decent sense of adventure. One of the reasons why I like "E.T." better is that some of this movie's scenes were too loud and chaotic. The bike chase at the end of "E.T." is thrilling, and one of the reasons why is because there's just the right amount of things going on that you really get involved with what's happening to the characters. Sometimes "Super 8" contained too much chaos. Michael Giacchino ("Star Trek","Up")composed the music, so it was pretty good, although I wish the movie had a recognizable theme. With a few exceptions, not many movies these days have musical themes. The suspense was good, and the acting wasn't bad. I think that the movie lacked a good chase scene, which would have made it more fun. Overall, I liked it, and I guess if I were asked, I would see it again.

Swift shot: If you see this one in theaters, count yourself enlightened, if you wait to rent or own Blu Ray, consider yourself miserable. Because, trust me, if you wait til you are home to see this for the first time, unless you are exceptionally wealthy and have a veritable theater sized screen at home – - – you are going to be kicking yourself forever! Occasionally, every few decades or so, a film comes along that just fires on all cylinders and resonates with something inside you that hasn't been active since you were a kid. Super 8 manages to do just that, stir up imaginations I once thought completely dormant – where the critical, cynical adult in me keeps the child bolted up in a dungeon called "the impossible". I want to thank EVERYONE who made this film a reality, and I wonder if Paramount knows just how fortunate they are to have some of the best film-makers to ever hold that title on their label? Set in 1979 in a steel town in Ohio, Super 8 essentially is a story about a group of friends, over the summer, dealing with a tragedy that one of them endures at the onset of the film. It has the feel of a Stand By Me script, though devoid of any narration or device that tells the story in the present. This film, again, is just an Amazing Story with a supernatural, monster-thriller, or sci-fi element tossed in to keep the characters constantly malleable and interesting.With great tragedy comes the need for great distraction, and Writer/Director J. J. Abrams gets this, and displays this, quite efficiently. Rather than let their friend, Joe (Joel Courtney) dwell on his personal loss, his gang of misfits, led by Charles (Riley Griffiths) – who thinks he is the next Hitchcock or Romero – comes up with a perfect distraction . . . a zombie film. At first some of the others think it a bit tacky to involve a kid who just lost someone close to be shooting a zombie flick, but they figure it might help him take his mind off of the loss as well. Not to mention, the girl who everyone is afraid to talk to, Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) has agreed to be in the film as zombie hunting detective, Martin's (Gabriel Basso) wife.It all starts off innocently enough, Alice steals her dad's car, without a license (rebels that they are) to drive them to the shoot, EXTERIOR: late at night, a train station, now closed. They run through lines, Charles delights in directing his friends, and he tries to get the most out of what he's working with. His friends are a great team, considering they are in middle-school, and they manage a level of professionalism that exceeds their years. Then, something happens, a crash, about an EIGHT on the butt-pucker scale (patent pending), which really sets the sci-fi or supernatural elements into locomotion.What happens next is all too easy to spoil, suffice it to say, something is not quite right in the steel town of Lilian, Ohio circa 1979. The Air Force, helmed by Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) is somehow involved, Joe's dad, Jackson, the deputy sheriff, played by the exceptionally talented TV-actor (Kyle Chandler) is suddenly put in charge and the misfits find themselves caught in the middle of everything but are still hell-bent on finishing their film to submit to the Cleveland Film Festival . . . ah great aspirations must start somewhere, but Cleveland? Comedy and tragedy is spliced into the story masterfully in short little bursts with character dialog, incredible action sequences and excellent acting. And, someone check me if I am wrong, but did they cryo freeze the blond-haired brat from the 70′s version of The Bad News Bears and place braces on him to hide his identity? Because, that kid Cary (Ryan Lee) in Super 8 is his clone! Super 8 is a high-tech drama with a childish heart that reminds you what it was like to build models, pine for the prettiest girl in school, and to never stop fighting for those you love. It is a film about loss, grief, struggling to cope and acceptance, all with a "twist" just to make things more interesting . . . or rather, AMAZING!

I've wanted to see this movie since the first teaser came out. I really wanted to like this movie. I wanted to be blown away by it. But I'd have to say, I didn't feel it lived up to my expectations.People use the word "nostalgia" a lot when talking about this movie. I suppose that means a couple of things: 1) The movie is set in the late 1970s, in small town America, when friendships were made through real face-to-face interactions. 2) It's a thriller told through the eyes of kids, which has been done most successfully by Spielberg, who had a hand in the story. (M. Night Shyamalan would be the next guy in mind, but it's not great to be compared to him right now.) If that is all you need for a movie to work, you're all set. Super 8 has all of that. It has a fantastic cast of child actors and a story that works. It wasn't trying to blow you away with explosions (although there's plenty of that). In fact, it's the polar opposite of a Michael Bay action film. It's an action film that focuses on story, not action.I feel that the excitement Abrams had in making this movie reflected the excitement the kids in the movie had in making their own movie. I think many kids (including myself when I was that age) who managed to get their hands on a camera liked making movies and telling stories. But if you're familiar with Abrams style of storytelling, you know that he likes to start of with a big mysterious happening and tease the audience along. That works only for so long because eventually, you need to reveal what is really happening. The movie as a whole becomes a tease that grows gradually over the movie. You see a flash, a shadow, a glimpse, you see things that suggest size and power and you picture something awesome.In many ways, Super 8 follows the dangerous path that M. Night Shyamalan followed in movies like "The Village" and "Signs." In this case, I'm not talking about a twist ending. I'm talking about the build-up to the mystery core of the movie. If you're going to spend most of your marketing and most of the movie teasing your audience about a mystery "thing," you'd better make sure that "thing" works. One thing about Spielberg's movies like Jaws and Jurassic Park is that there's no mystery about what you'll see. You know what a shark looks like and you know what dinosaurs look like. With a movie like Super 8, a lot of the expectation rests on what exactly this "thing" is and whether that "thing" turns out to meet or exceed your expectations. For me, it didn't meet my expectations. It was just okay. I felt like I've seen it before. You probably have as well.

This was one of the most boring movies I have seen this year. I feel really deceived by the trailers. NOTHING happens till the train crash and the train crash doesn't happen till half way through.I got the distinct impression from the trailers that the crash WAS the start of the movie, and would that it were so because then it may have been tolerable.An hour of a few kids mucking around and making a movie, been done way better and if i wanted that I would have gone to watch that, only then I would have been disappointed with the abrupt appearance of a monster half way through my kids making a movie movie.The story is from then on riddled with things that don't make sense, are incredibly stupid, cliché ("i'm a bad army man rrrrrrrrr, i do bad things for no reason to show i'm bad") or just don't work (I'm supposed to care for a rampaging menace????).Avoid.

If there is any wonder about what Abrams is capable of in terms of being a filmmaker, Super 8 should sufficiently debunk this. While he is certainly a great producer, this is Abrams first original picture. But never fear, he succeeds again with a fine picture that will warm your heart and excite you.In case you are wondering what this whole thing is about, I will try to keep the plot as a minimum so as to save much of the surprise. Joe Lamb is helping his best buddy make a zombie film in the 1970's when they witness a horrendous train wreck. What follows are several days of unexplained activity that alters all their lives in exciting and frightening ways. Super 8 has been said to be reminiscent of all those old Amblin Spielberg films of the 80's, and it's not far off. There is a good mix of several films in here, including Stand By Me, ET, Close Encounters, and other classic films. Some will blow this off as nothing special, merely a nostalgic trip trying to replicate Spielberg. But in Abrams hands, this is a well crafted and very well directed film. The child actors here are some of the best most emotionally provocative that I have seen in a long, long time. Elle Fanning, in particular, is fantastic. All the children are, and it's something that has rarely been seen since Spielberg, who is arguably the best child director in the industry. But beyond the actors, the cinematography is also of note. Firstly, the train wreck is handled extremely well. It's both frightening and exciting and truly underscores the damage and effect that it will have on the town. And when the creature from within the train begins to wreak havoc, it's extremely effective. Though this is not a horror movie, horror film principles are applied in getting the most out of the tension of these scenes. Some reviews have called the sci-fi elements weak, but I would argue against that. There are issues, which I will get into later, but the scenes dealing with this creature before it's big reveal are nice and scary. These scenes are countered with even better drama. As stated, these child actors are fantastic, and that really makes the scenes in which the budding love story or family drama shines through. Of course, the film has it's issues, the reason it's an 8 and not higher. First of all, I took issue with some of the separation between the monster plot line and the plots involving the kids and their drama. It's almost like two films are being played out here, and while that may have been how the film initially started (as ideas for two different films coming together), it's kind of disheartening to see that they never truly figured out how to make the two interweave naturally. My second issue involves some story elements that seem like they could have been developed more, namely the father-son relationship between Joe and his father. His dad spends much of the time trying to figure out what's going on. We know there are issues there between Joe and his father, and one scene between the two showing this doesn't really encompass the true nature and effect of these problems. It would have also been nice to see more interaction between the two, but I won't spoil anything about why I think this. These are minor issues though for a film that is well crafted and truly enjoyable. Yes, the film is quite nostalgic. However, there are a great deal of touches Abrams puts in himself that make this his own film. For those who grew up on all those old Amblin films, this will warm your heart, and for those who didn't grow up on those, you'll have a chance to know what it felt like to see a film like ET for the first time. Simply put, call this film this generations ET or Stand By Me.

In 1979, in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio, a preteen boy named Joe Lamb is trying to cope with the recent death of his mother, who was killed in a factory accident. Much to the frustration of his father, the town's deputy sheriff, Joe copes by immersing himself in a project lead by his best friend, Charles. That project is a horror film, shot on a SUPER 8 camera, and Charles has enlisted the help of not only Joe, but the rest of his misfit friends, and has surprised everyone by talking Alice Dainard, the prettiest girl in school, into playing the hero's wife. On the night of the first big shoot, the would be filmmaker witness a train crash. Pretty soon, the town of Lillian is swarmed by military men, who won't tell anybody what is going on. Abrams and Spielberg may be the only two people in Hollywood who still know how to keep a secret, so I won't spoil that by going into the plot too much further. But I will say that Super 8 lives up to every bit of hype and expectation surrounding it. This is a beautifully crafted, emotional, funny, scary, thrilling movie that enthralls an audience the ways Spielberg's 80s classics did. And this is coming from someone who has been accused of "worshipping" Spielberg. Abrams has recreated the look and feel of vintage Spielberg expertly, down to the last detail. For a Spielberg fan, it's an absolute joy to behold.But Abrams somehow manages to do this without completely sacrificing his own unique voice as a filmmaker. It's got the twists and turns of Lost, the personality of his Star Trek, and, like most Abrams projects, a leading lady who propels the whole thing. In this case, it's young Elle Fanning, who, as Alice, projects such a genuine combination of childlike innocence and ahead of her years maturity, that you can't take her eyes off of her whenever she's on screen. The entire cast is terrific, especially Joel Courtney as Joe, and Riley Griffiths as Charles, but Fanning steals the movie. We become completely involved with these characters in a way we rarely do with adult Hollywood heroes. I found myself caring every bit as much about the budding romance between Alice and Joe as I did the more spectacular events of the film.And it is spectacular. Abrams and Spielberg give us action/suspense scenes that evoke Spielberg's classics Jaws, Jurassic Park, and E.T. They also come as close to the emotion of E.T. as any film of this type has done since then. Super 8 is the kind of film for which the cliché "You''ll laugh, you'll cry" was invented. If you're a child of the 80s and complain that they don't make movies the way they did when you were a kid, well, Abrams and Spielberg have done exactly that.And Michael Giacchino further establishes himself as one of the best film composers to come along in years. His score soars with emotions and build suspense in the vein of (of course) John Williams.I also have to take a moment, as former amateur child filmmaker, to talk about how well rendered that aspect of the story is. It certainly added an extra level of enjoyment for me that I vividly remember the days of trying to make my own blockbusters with nothing but a camera, a few friends, and wildly overactive imagination.It's worth mentioning, by way of warning (especially to parents) that Super 8 is rated PG-13 for a reason, namely the intensity, and for an E.T./Goonies like tendency to have the kids swear. Most audiences will get past this, but certainly some will not, and I'm absolving myself of any complaints. Movies like this are the reason I love movies. In an age when trailers give away everything, Super 8 unfolds before us, capturing us in its spell, and never letting go. It's an unforgettable movie experience. A film to be treasured,

I'm of the belief that most people haven't yet digested just how much things have changed over the last five years. We're living in a different world than we were in 2006, one that certainly seems alien to the movie settings of classic-era Steven Spielberg films. A modern world that, aside from the look of the creature/catalyst in the film itself, is alien to the world we see in J.J. Abrams' 1970s-set film, Super 8.Set your clock back to 1979, a simpler time, back when people moved slower, talked nicer and  well  cared more. Now consider these things: The Goonies; Close Encounters of the Third Kind; Signs; Cloverfield; the geeks from "Freaks the Geeks"; and maybe, just maybe, a splash of Mars Attacks! and Spielberg's War of the Worlds and ET. Throw all that junk in a blender, stick it in a small town (still, remember, in 1979) and you have an idea of the style and appeal of this Abrams' new movie. The story, as it should be, is a simple one. Basically, something really bad happens to a small town full of good people. Something impossible to understand, even for the Air Force dudes who have been working on a solution for decades. Something impossible that only the silent minds of children can translate and solve. We meet our crew of inevitable heroes - five sassy boys and one enigmatic and broken girl - as they savor their summer break working on a zombie movie they plan to enter into a film festival. They go here, they go there, they screw around, not unlike the crew of goons from Goonies or even Stand by Me. The lead boy, Joe (played by future star Joel Courtney), is the soulful son of a fearless and recently widowed deputy (played brilliantly by "Friday Night Lights" star Kyle Chandler); his best friend (the hilarious Riley Griffiths) is a brilliant old soul with big dreams and high emotions; and Joe's crush (the suddenly amazing Elle Fanning) is the stunning daughter of Joe's father's mortal enemy, a town drunk named Louis Dainard (Ron Elard). Solid set-up, right? Formulaic you say? You bet.And sure, Super 8 is, from afar, quite formulaic. A period piece monster/alien flick set in a small town and led by a cast of incredibly lovable "tweens" - almost sounds like something a scriptwriting class would put down on paper, right? Who cares. Abrams handles each frame, each scene, each gigantic explosion and slight facial expression, with so much love, so much skill and so much studied consideration that you can't help but get sucked into his Spielberg- produced version of movie magic. As the story progresses we know that everything will eventually - after plenty of running scared, wild flames, sweet tears and epic destruction - be alright. There will be a hug and maybe a kiss. There will be heroes and connections. There will be sub plots that make us care and bad guys who only the crowd can understand in full. Super 8 is, without any doubt, a big, brawny blockbuster film that intends to touch all the bases - your head, your heart, your funny bone and, most importantly to folks like myself, the part of your soul that values strongly crafted screen art.Without giving away too much, I'll just say this: Super 8 is the first movie I ever outwardly cheered for during the end credits. Not because it's necessarily a huge artistic achievement like, say, Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life; but because it managed to take me to another world. A world where Michael Bay isn't allowed, Spielberg is your lovable guiding light, we don't solve our problems with computers and  ya know  anything is possible. Movie magic. And sure, same as was the case with M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, there are plot holes of reason here and there that some NASA goofs will someday dissect. But how much has that really ever mattered at the movies? And do we, the people of 2011, have any business saying what could or should be in an alternate reality such as the one in the 70s small town of Super 8? We, the lovers of fiction, do not.My recommendation: leave the boringly logical part of your brain at home, forget about reality television, get to the theater and escape to Steven Spielberg and J.J Abram's 1979. Super 8 is a tasty, incredibly well-made Hollywood film that demands another lap before it has even crossed home. Somehow the so- far best commercially released film of 2011is a blockbuster about aliens, "tweens" and explosions.

I'm sorry to have to contradict the first review but I did not get as much out of this movie as they did and in fact I would not recommend it all. It was a loud hash of a movie which was all over the place. It has elements of all the movies he mentions i suppose and I could not help noticing all the gestures to earlier films but it was very long, not pacey at all and the trailer is probably the best part of it. Maybe its trying too hard to pay homage, develop character and suspense,and tell a story which holds together. It didn't work for me. I saw X-men 1st class a few days ago and enjoyed it far more and in fact could watch it and Thor again no problem. Its all about opinions as they say I suppose so the only way to find out is to go and see it yourself.

I was able to see Super 8 in Imax yesterday evening. This movie captures all emotions. The actors are well casted and did a great job. Yes there is a train crash, yes there is a monster, but there is so much more to this movie. Fear, humor, sadness, excitement.....It's all there. Of course for those who go who really want to see what came out of the train that night, you will definitely get an in depth look. It's not like in Cloverfield, which I also love, where you have an idea of what the monster looks like and he's in and out of focus.It's funny, it's intense, and it makes you appreciate the value of human life. MUST SEE!!!

The theme of "aliens" have been tainted much in modern cinema such as in the abysmal Skyline and the mediocre Battle:LA. Even Steven Spielberg had spoilt his latest Indiana Jones installment with aliens. This theme has reached its overdose and keeps on firing at all of the wrong directions.Thankfully, director J.J. Abrams saved the theme gloriously with this film. With an interesting plot, a fresh band of young (very potential) actors and great special effects, J.J. Abrams have unleashed one of the greatest aliens films easily in this decade.The story is told very similar to 1980s Steven Spielberg alien films (ET & Close Encounters Of The Third Kind) where suspense play a large role to keep the viewers hooked.Therefore, I strongly recommend to give this movie a go and exit the cinema with a brand new feeling that has been missing in the films lately. Also, like Inception, the lesser you know before you watch the movie...the better.

Walking into this film, I figured that this would just be "Cloverfield in the '70's with kids", but I was totally wrong. The film exceeded almost all my expectations The plot is very basic: a train wreck with mysterious cargo crashes in a quiet, rural town. 5 children witness the crash and run off in fear. The town is then tormented by a mysterious creature from the train. I don't want to give any major details away, so I'll stop there. What I will say, however is that the film has the tension and excitement that Abrams fans have come to expect from all his latest films. The acting in this, however, exceeds all that I've seen this year (and I've seen a lot this year). The child actors SHINE compared to the adults in the movie (and in some other films this year: Pirates 4 for example).Abrams really got rid of all the negative qualities of Cloverfield and replaced them with audience-friendly traits: the most important being ANSWERS!!!!! Many (including myself) walked out of Cloverfield with questions about everything: what happened to the characters, what is the monster, where did the monster come from, etc. ALL of these are answered in Super 8. Some could argue that the lack of answers added to the mysteriousness of Cloverfeild, but others want to know backstory about the film's characters (myself included). However, Abrams still sticks to the Cloverfeild formula; giving the audience little glimpses of the monster to keep everyone interested Abrams stuck with his editing team from Star Trek for Super 8, lens flares and all. The lens flares weren't as annoying in this as they were in Star Trek, but you still notice them as they fill the screen with a bright light. I found it really annoying (I wear heavy prescription glasses and have to put up with lens flare all the time) and at some times it was worse than Star Trek. Abrams really toned it down, all considered.In close, I really have to say that this has been my favorite film this year (and putting up with trash like Fast Five, it's not a surprise). The acting is superb, especially from the children. It's a must-see

If there's one movie you shouldn't miss this year, it's Super 8. There's more heart and soul in it's two hour running time than most mainstream movies could ever hope to conjure. It's the kind of film that reminds you of why you go to the movies.In the current era of CGI laden, soul-dead adventure flicks, Super 8 distinguishes itself by having heart. There is an authenticity to those kids in the film, a familiarity in their conversations. It reminded me of when I was a kid. The friendship between the kids in the film really resonates, and the emotional elements of the film totally deliver. One of the most poignant scenes in the film has nothing to do with whats in the train car, or the air force, and anything like that....rather, its a scene that takes place in Joe's bedroom as he sits on the floor talking to Alice. Super 8 is an Abrams "Mystery Box" complete with a satisfying unveiling of the goodies inside. With only his third film, Abrams has made a truly spectacular must-see film that demands to be seen as quickly as possible. Allowing some of the surprises to be spoiled is simply not an option. It's the best movie so far of 2011, and it's a real treat. You do not want to miss it!

One of the most anticipated films of the summer, at least from a sci-fi geek's perspective, Super 8 is a mixture of all things good and bad about Hollywood filmmaking. With a strong team working behind the camera including Steven Spielberg as producer, Super 8 is technically stunning for a US$50 million blockbuster. However, it is the essential matter of plot and character that ruins the film in ways that we do not come to expect from a J.J. Abrams' film. As evident in Mission: Impossible III (2006) and Star Trek (2009), Abrams can direct an action picture. Unfortunately, he does not seem to write as well as he directs.In Super 8, the basic premise goes like this: Some school kids including lead protagonist Joe (Joel Courtney) use their Super 8 camera to shoot a zombie short for a local film festival. When shooting outdoors one night in a deserted train stop, a train zooms past before colliding head-on with a vehicle, leaving the kids to scurry for their lives amidst explosions and flying metal in the film's first and most satisfying action set-piece. The mystery of the train wreck slowly reveals itself to be something more sinister, and it is up to the boys and a girl, Alice (Elle Fanning), to find the answers.A tribute of sorts to Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), while referencing his other works such as E.T. The Extra Terrestrial (1982), War of the Worlds (2005), and even Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Super 8 is like seeing, and I quote Roger Ebert, "a lost early Spielberg classic". Well, at least for the first hour that is. The setup of the plot is excellent with specific attention going to the production design, which evokes a fairly strong mood associated with 1970s suburbia. The cinematography and editing are praiseworthy too. Like I said earlier, this film is technically flawless.But the problem with Abrams' film lies past the halfway mark. Plot becomes unrealistic as situations unfold not with logic but with convenience. A plot device involving a vibrating cube is not explained thoroughly. Worse, Joe and Alice's fathers are not developed well enough such that the respective father-child relationships appear to be less emotionally potent than expected. While sometimes Spielberg is accused of overindulging in sentimentality, at least his films are realistically depicted and his characters strongly motivated. For Abrams, the characters in Super 8 may be far from paper-thin, but there are flaws in the way they react to change.The visual effects are amazing to look at though. Unfortunately, the climax is short-lived instead of the lengthy spectacular extravaganza it should have aspired to. Speaking of which, Super 8 could have done with an additional 15-20 minutes because the final act seems awkwardly paced, as if there is a mad rush to complete the film. Super 8 may have its flaws, but it is still generally quite an entertaining picture. While I will fall short of praising Abrams for his work here, I still think it is a decent tribute to the wide-eyed wonderment of 1970s sci-fi cinema. But if you look into my eyes, I am clearly only half hypnotized.GRADE: B (7.5/10 or 3.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.

I'm as big of a Abrams fan as anyone but I am starting to find a formula that he, in my opinion needs to separate himself from. I noticed this with LOST and CLOVERFIELD specifically and now with SUPER 8. As you know in all three of these Abrams likes to keep it very secret and not tell you anything to build up the hype by producing very vague trailers. Then when you watch the movie its almost the same thing throughout the movie or show its all build up. This is cool like once in my opinion to really know nothing until the end and it would be okay if it were more frequent if the delivery was beyond par but in all these films the build up always far surpasses the delivery. The ending specifically in SUPER 8 and LOST are super weak and/or unoriginal with CLOVERFIELD the whole movie is just build up no attempt to deliver a concluding endings. I also am aware he is producer in those other concepts but I certainly think he has creative control. BUT!!! this still was a great film in many other ways, it was a great homage to Spielbergs earlier films. The kid actors did really well and had pretty witty lines that were constant. The action had great suspense so that's why I gave this film a 7 and the ending or final "delivery" I would give it somewhere between a 1 and 3 but had that been slightly more original or interesting I would of easily given this film a 9 or 10 but again the end was so weak to me that it ruined it by at least three stars.

When I saw the title, "AMBLIN" with a bicycle silhouetted by the moon, as the film started, I said, "Oh, oh." I was right to be apprehensive. The film was filled with dumb, illogical plot devices, non-sequitur scenes, childish, hokey writing and the most absurd plot device I have ever seen in a movie. Get this:A high speed train being hauled by a diesel locomotive weighing in excess of 15,000 tons is caused to entirely crash, derail and have its cars spread out about half a mile by a small pick up truck. The crash continues for about ten minutes. Is that stupid enough? No. Guess what? The driver of the small pick up truck survives ... with some injuries. The driver is later murdered by the Air Force, giving no meaningful or logical explanation for the murder.It's Sci-Fi as seen from the eyes of early teenagers. The dumb things we saw in some of the Spielberg films from years ago, such as a boy hammering away at his breakfast dishes at his breakfast, with a large plastic bat, while his parents ignore him, all intact in this film. I cannot believe this is a JJ Abrams movie. The film was one "HUH, WHAT?" moment after another. Going further would contain too many spoilers. If you can ignore all the dumb moments, you might enjoy it.

This was excellent! Part of what made it great was not knowing the full plot before hand. Do yourself a favor - don't IMDb it to get the whole scoop - just check it out.The young cast was AMAZING...it was like watching a group of real kids...not a bunch of child actors.It is well written, well acted, well directed, well produced. The story is so good that you can buy into the fictional elements. I didn't know it was J.J. Abrams...He's redeemed himself from the crappy wrap-up of LOST with this movie.And it's Spielberg at his best. I was taken back to the emotional involvement I experienced with E.T..This is by far the best movie I've seen this year...I already want to see it again. It has a little bit of everything - comedy, drama, suspense, sci-fi, action! It's what a movie should be but rarely is these days - worth the price of admission, fun and entertaining.Kudos on keeping this one under wraps - FINALLY - a great movie after years of crap!!

J.J. Abrams has released his first complete brain-child, something completely his own. Well, sort of. For a long time he's had the idea and the characters for a movie about a group of kids making movies in the early 70′s. This was not enough to bring people into the theaters, or to hold a serious plot. So, this second idea of a monster movie, which Abrams also has had in his pocket for a while, was thrown into the melting pot, and Super 8 was born. The combination of the two ideas is actually pretty obvious while watching the movie. It's almost one half characters, one half monsters. But the synchronization and blending of the two was done well enough not to detract from the actual movie.Something about the story and production of the movie that has gotten a lot of attention from critics is the comparison and similarity of this movie to classic Steven Spielberg movies like E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Firstly, the people are right. The camera work and angles, the similar story idea about a kid and an alien, and other aspects really are very similar to said movies. But the last time I checked, those were incredible movies, and this follows suite. It is like a band covering another, and doing it well enough to be called their own. That's the best analogy I can make. Secondly, while very similar in some areas, it sets itself apart with it's new-age effects, and I think the characters are immensely deeper than those of movies past.If there is one thing that made this movie as good as it was, it was the cast, the group of kids specifically. Most of them had not seen much work, so finding such a great combination of people is awesome to see. These kids were incredible. They bring thoughts of The Goonies, a pack of friends that are just an absolute joy to watch go through some crazy adventures. These kids' on-screen presence was palpable, begging to be called perfect. Joel Courtney, the new-coming lead role, was great. You can feel both his pain and his compassion throughout. His cast of movie- making buddies, with Riley Griffiths playing the control freak director, Ryan Lee playing the wacky pyromaniac and Gabriel Basso playing the quirky actor, are virtually a non-fictional group of friends making movies together. Last, but definitely not least, we have the enchanting Elle Fanning, who from her first time being on-screen in this movie, completely blew me out of the water. She is an older kid brought into the gang's movie to play the leading actress, and even her in-movie acting is insane. Since her role in Somewhere, which I thought she killed, she seems so much more mature and grown up. She is so lovely and adorable, much more-so than her sister, who is nothing to scoff at herself, I can only wait patiently to see what her extremely young career can blossom into. Kyle Chandler also turns in a very solid role as Courtney's absent, mourning father.As far as the actual monster goes, there are some holes that can be punched in it's story-line, but as a whole it does its job to thrill, and even scare us and put us on the edge of our seats. There is more I'd like to say, but that is flirty with spoiler territory, so I won't get into it. There is also the ending of the movie, which I thought left questions unanswered, and maybe wanting a little bit more, but won't take too much shine from the whole thing.One specific scene I was very excited for was the train crashing scene. Abrams and Spielberg both said in an interview that they loved the idea of doing their own trail derailing scene in a movie someday, and it really shows in the early part of this movie. The crash scene itself is spectacular, awe-inspiring. The other effects are great as well, with a typical Abrams monster, that you get to see a lot more of than Cloverfield.As a side note, I was really hoping that the soundtrack would match the potential of the visuals of the movie, but I think it was a little disappointing. Probably the only forgettable thing about the entire movie, which is a great thing to say.Be sure to stay for the credits!My RatingSuper 8 is almost a tribute to movies of its own in-story time, with a near perfect cast and characters, and delicious looking special effects. While the meshing of two ideas, characters and a monster, struggles at points, and the ending is slightly disappointing, the overall product is wonderfully nostalgic, while successfully being its own work of art.Find all of my reviews at robpg.wordpress.com

The movie is quite interesting...for about 30 minutes. Then things fall apart. It slows way down. Strange events happen over and over (and over again!) However, I was still interested in finding out what was really going on and wanted to know the cause of the events. However, the ending is quite contrived and everything that happens to save the day happens quite conveniently. But the real bummer is that nothing's really explained. Just like in Abram's TV series LOST, he doesn't bother to give answers to a whole bunch of questions. However, the worst part of this movie is the last two minutes...it's unbelievably schmaltzy and not worthy for anything but a movie that's intended for six-year-olds.

Here's how I feel about it in one sweeping oversimplification: If you love movies, you're going to love this movie. That is of course unless you've grown cynical and bitter and can no longer tolerate genre-entertainment.It has everything I want in a movie. Adventure, action, suspense, humor, and relatable characters who experience things the way humans do. Sure, there were a couple moments at the end where I thought, "Really?", but Abrams and the gang were savvy enough to put almost every objection my overly-rational grown-up mind had throughout the picture and put skeptical words into the mouth of a nearby character, thereby stealing my ammunition.I don't think you need to love movies in order to enjoy this ride, but if you love movies or, especially, if you've ever made one of your own, I don't see how you could dislike it.Plus all the sci-fi-ish stuff was badass.

This is not just about Steven Spielberg or J.J. Abrams... or paying homage to anyone or anything. So do yourself a favor, and put all of that out of your mind when you go see Super 8.If you are a fan of movies, movie-making, a good storyline, well acted interaction between characters...Then you will most likely love Super 8. There is some action, some blood, a few jump scares etc. But the real quality parts of Super 8 is the character relationships and how their stories unfold. Dialogue between the characters is very good and it moves the story along at a good pace in my opinion. They fill in the blanks with facts just when you start to wonder, "Why?"The alien is indeed mean, creepy, and hard to sympathize with. But if you listen to the reasons, then you will understand why.The creature is not without compassion. In the end you will not only be happy it has left the planet, but you will also be happy for the alien as well.

Think Spielberg Lite: a dollop of his heart, half the storytelling ability, ladle on the special effects.Super 8 is a nearly forgotten film format that succumbed to portable video in the late Seventies. Much the same way "Super 8" will be quickly forgotten by the time eyes acclimate to sunshine outside the theater.'Popcorn' films were invented by Mr. Spielberg who mentored this project that's a thinly disguised sycophantic homage. Mr. Abrams (born 1965) is no Spielberg. (Speilberg is no longer Spielberg.) There are a few obvious nods to Mr. S.: among many others, a character named Brody, flying bike and a shot cobbed directly from "CE3K." In "Super 8" Mr. Abrams also casts himself as the heir apparent to the Speilbergian crown. It's the same deadly mistake M. Night Shyamalan made in stating, "I'm the new Hitchcock," just before releasing "The Happening."Summer blockbusters eschew artistic merit for the promise of thrill ride entertainment. But Mr. Abrams falls far short by offering cardboard cutout characters – the square jawed, brave Sheriff-Dad; the mean-as-hell USAF Colonel - playacting basic emotions in a logic-defying story. In a reversal of Spielberg's 'Absent Dad', the opening shots introduce the 'Absent Mom' who's been crushed to death by a steel beam in the local mill. It's 1979. You know, when America still made steel.A group of budding filmmakers hope to score big at the Cleveland Film Festival by producing a Zombie opus. Their filmic effort is interrupted by a massive train wreck loosing an alien transported cross-country via rail. (Huh?) The alien crashed on Earth a few decades ago, and suffered torture at the hand of the aforementioned mean-as-hell Colonel. (Why is it advanced lifeforms have difficulties piloting their craft? Don't they have to pass a test?) It seems all the none-too-cute alien really wants is to go home. Gee, that has a familiar ring.The Kid-Director sees an opportunity to use the wreckage and sudden influx of military as backdrop and 'production value' for "The Case," the Zombie film within 'Super 8." Meanwhile, a little romance brews between the leading lady and our 13 year old hero.Of course the leading lady is abducted as lunch for the alien, and the brave hero sets off to rescue her. The contrivances pile so high and so rapidly the brain numbs. Anyone over six years old intuits where things are headed light years before they occur. (Why are humans such a delicacy on alien menus? All the dogs are smarter and split the County before they become snacks.)The one saving grace is Elle Fanning who is not only too good for "The Case," but too stellar for "Super 8." Her eyes belie a depth even her sister, Dakota, hasn't plumbed – and that's saying a lot. However, there's cheapness in using a plot device featuring children as wise stand-ins for adult thoughts and emotions. Kids are kids. They ain't wise.There are a few laughs, but most of the wise ass lines fall flat and, at the showing I attended, were met with stony silence not only by this reviewer but my fellow travelers as well.On the technical side the dialog mix was set very low. This is always a clue the filmmaker is practicing sleight of hand to direct your attention to the visuals, not the story."Super 8" as a 'Popcorn' film is only modestly entertaining, and in fairness the first half holds promise, but then plods to a feeble, sappy conclusion. It's mostly zip-bam-boom, and more surrender-your-brain-at-the-concession-stand than most. In its sloppy, ill and under-written script lies the germ of a great story with a lot of heart. Unfortunately, Mr. Abrams left that part in his word processor and instead infused the film with narcissistic recollections of his pubescent years as a LA film business brat. And set it all to his favorite songs from the late Seventies.Make certain to stay through the credits when the amateurish "The Case" is unspooled in its entirety. It's funnier and more entertaining than the preceding two hours. Better still, stay home and NetFlix a double feature of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "ET."

I have been a sci-fi fan since I first laid eyes on a guy in an alien suit. But, it has been a few years since the genre really felt alive to me. These days, the genre has either forgetting it's roots or tried to hard to push the limits of CGI. Super 8, is the savior I have been waiting for.Super 8 is a truly amazing experience and to say that is a blend of many 80's kids Sci-Fi films is definitely an accurate speculation. However, I feel that the strongest comparison would be E.T. meets Stand By Me. The film has many memorable parts and to spoil them would be a crime so just trust me when I say that it is worth all time and money that you will spend to see it.Finally, watch out for the train scene because it will send your hearing in to a panic. For you Universal monster fans, keep an eye out for a Creature From The Black Lagoon action figure. Lastly, stay for the credits to see the kids movie and a fun little reference to the king of zombie cinema.

The brightest part of this movie are the kids and their performances. Very likable and relatable. And it was fairly obvious that we were looking into an aspect of the past of producer Steven Spielberg. I didn't know the plot before I showed up at the theater this morning. I didn't mind that the action took awhile to get going. We were looking at some earnest kids trying to finish their movie while dealing with a little angst and a terrific loss for the lead. After the action gets going with the monster you could really see the hand and attributes of a Spielberg production. They were all thrown in here. Not all of it made sense. For instance, the monster seemed to be alone in his fury and wrath against humans but there were attacks all over town simultaneously and continuously. Pretty busy for a single monster. And it made the action pretty unreliable. One gets used to rolling ones eyes once in a while. Toward the end I couldn't keep my eyes still. I give the movie 6 out of 10 stars because of the charming leads but only 6 due to its need for severe belief suspension.

Super 8 was an excellent movie. It's not your typical alien movie where some monster runs around blowing crap up, this one actually has a story. I think that J. J. Abrams is getting better and better. His Star Trek reboot was an instant classic and he did a FANTASTIC job with this film. Steven Spielberg was outstanding as usual. This movie doesn't have star power, but part of what made this film work was the chemistry between the cast members (particulary between Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning). The cast members in this film are incredibly talented. So if you add J. J. Abrams plus Steven Spielberg, plus a good plot, script, special effects and cast, what do you get?.......A Truly OUTSTANDING FILM. Did I mention that this film is mysterious, action packed, dramatic, sometimes scary, and funny? All of these components add up to make this worthwhile and very entertaining. This movie is this year's Inception, and that means its AMAZING.

Meh.. good story.. kinda boring in some parts.. I know ET and this is no ET.. l love movies.. I only kinda liked it. Trying to hard for the kids to be funny... another movie that makes US military look bad and aliens good. I was looking forward to it.. actually when I left the theater.. people where saying what a waste of money it was, my brother and I thought the same...because of the hype of this movie..I'm no longer going to the theaters and waiting for pay per view/ Satellite or DVD and save myself $40 in the process. Disappointing . I know goonies and this is no goonies.. I know Temple of Doom and this is no temple of doom, I know raiders of the lost ark.. and this is no raiders of the lost ark... Don't listen to critics.. it's not a masterpiece.. it's blah.. almost wishing it was over sooner.. sad.. had potential.. but something went wrong...

This movie was a breath of fresh air. I saw all the comparisons to E.T. before viewing this film and being 25, E.T. was one of my favorite movies as a kid, but I was honestly desperately hoping they could do an alien film with kids without trying to pull needless tears out of me. I just didn't want that type of emotional ride. That being said, let me say this movie is NOTHING like E.T. We all know E.T. is about children who *befriend* an alien and he parts at the end and we're all just devastated. That is not the case here at all. The only remote similarity to E.T. this movie holds is the "style" in which it is shot, but if we are judging by "style," we can also say at some points this movie is comparable to The Goonies. The hairstyles, clothing, cars, etc have a very 80s feel to them, but the year is very ambiguous. It could be taking place in present day, it could be in 1982, it could be anytime. If you are a sci-fi fan, you will absolutely love this movie. If you are nostalgic for "the way movies used to be made," you will LOVE this movie. As soon as the credits begin to roll, I was already ready to watch the movie again because I just couldn't get enough. Although, they could have carried the story a little further, it really wasn't necessary. So, if you choose not to read any further, just know this movie is definitely the best film that has came out this year and totally worth all the hype. Thank you for reading. ***STOP HERE, MAY SPOIL*** My only difficulty during the movie was Elle Fanning's character and the one boy's creepy crush on her that goes undiscussed for quite a while. Her character is sort of clueless and really seems to have no place other than to be the one girl and to take part in the film the kids are making. I found myself, at times, kind of wishing she was not there. Her dad is depicted as a a-hole and we are not supposed to like him, but I found myself agreeing with him *just* because the boy had not really stated his purpose and was kinda "hanging around" just waiting on her to profess her undying love for him. However! I must say there's eventually a conversation and it was not really addressed how I thought it would be, but they were able to relate to one another in a way we were not aware of until the scene takes place. This redeems their relationship a little and makes it much easier to understand and to watch. Whew! ***DEFINITE SPOILERS*** Towards the end, I was pleasantly surprised to find the boy was willing to confront the alien face-to-face when I was *just* thinking, "Man, he should totally take on the alien himself instead of all of them running like idiots" and as soon as I thought it should happen, it did. The lesson was completely gratifying. The boy confronts his fear and verbalizes to the malevolent alien that "Bad things happen, but that doesn't mean you can't LIVE," which we know wasn't *just* about the alien situation currently taking place. We learn about "letting go" and acceptance. I was shocked they even thought to do this. It could have easily taken the direction of a war movie with the kids having some kind of insight into the situation, but this, oh, it was so much better. The movie knew what it wanted to be and completely stayed true to it the entire time.

I know what a blockbuster is. Super 8 is not. It's a good family film minus the dirty language used by one of the kids. I loved the sound track and seeing the phones from the 70's, cassette player and Walkman. The scene from the credits was great.I can't say enough about how great the kids were in the movie. Big things are in store for them.I don't understand why it's called Super 8 and the missing dogs. It's a movie that you can wait to see on DVD. I only went to see the movie because Steven Spielberg was associated with the project.I would honestly watch it again when it comes out on DVD but I wouldn't spend money to see it another time on the big screen. It's a great Saturday afternoon movie when you have nothing to do.

J.J. Abrams and the legendary Steven Spielberg join forces in this coming-of-age, science fiction film, Super 8. In the small town of Lilian, Ohio, a group of teenagers are making a zombie movie with their Super 8 mm camera, but fall witness to a catastrophic train crash. What follows are a series of mysterious events that include people missing, local dogs being discovered in neighboring counties, and the appearance of the military. I showed up to the movie's midnight premiere with very high expectations. A year ago, seeing the teaser trailer that implied that a mysterious alien creature would run amok just left me anticipating for June 10th to come. I was a huge fan of Cloverfield for its originality and non- stop action (as well as the monster himself), so I expected J.J. to create a masterpiece of its own. The way I can describe this movie is that it's like a recipe for a chocolate cake. The cake surely tastes delicious, but looking in the recipe book, you expected a little more. For example, many have complained about the ending, and this I can agree on. It's so rushed and abrupt right when you're in the middle of the awe and action that it's almost a bit of a turnoff. There were also points where the movie seemed so unrealistic (i.e. the Biology teacher surviving the train crash with half of his truck left unharmed), but they're things to be overlooked. What Abrams does perform though is an excellent set-up of the plot and production design. Yes, the plot does get messy by becoming various different types of movies, but it does it in a way that just manages to work out in the end. The design of the film was also well done, whether it be the beautiful train collision scene, the 80s feel, or the creature itself.The film itself pays a solid homage to classic Spielberg, giving off a "Close Encounters With The Third Kind"/"E.T."-esque vibe. However, this doesn't quite live up to either of those films. It turns out the reasons behind the alien's attacks is *SPOILERS* the usual "creature kept in captivity and tortured, and now hates all of mankind" cliché. It doesn't ruin the film, but it leaves a small tarnish on it. What separates this from most other summer flicks though is that it has a heart. The relationship between this young group of friends is flawless, and brings me back to when I was just a kid. Like most have said, it's like "The Goonies" or "The Sandlot" all over again. Acting-wise, the young and unknown (minus one face) cast is absolutely top-notch. Elle Fanning has proved herself to grow up into a strong and emotional actress, possibly better than her older sibling Dakota. Joel Courtney does an especially phenomenal job as Joe Lamb, who just can't let go of the recent death of his mother, and proves himself an especially powerful character in a scene where him and his Dad have a tear-jerking argument. Kyle Chandler does a great job as Joe's overburdened father, who not only has to juggle with the death of his wife, but the mysteries and troubles occurring in this town. Ron Eldard as Elle's character's father is truly an underrated and troubled character. Overall, outstanding cast.Overall, Super 8 is truly a unique summer flick in its own, but it just misses at certain points that make you feel like you expected some more from it.

I saw it today with my 11 year old son. He thought it was just-OK-good, probably because in the usual Speilbergy way, the smartest people in the film are 11 year old kids... I thought the story was poor, the action just "OK", and the effects pretty good.The story never really explains why the AF needed to move this super alien (by rail), how a small pickup can derail a huge locomotive, what they could have stored the alien in to begin with as he certainly does not have a problem ripping through metal...The alien seen eating a fellow citizen for dinner and five minutes later the little kids try to make the thing sympathetic. Kind of a weird transition for me.The killing of the bad military dude occurs approximately 3/4ths of the way through the movie, so you have that.The whole initial tension of the movie is set by the father of the hero-kid hating the hero-girl's dad because he (dad of hero girl) called in sick to work, the mother of hero-kid gets horribly killed at work, working the girls dads shift and everyone somehow thinks it's the dudes fault, he even gets arrested for coming to the wake... And... Yeah it's hard to follow or even understand.Didn't like the movie, my son only "liked" it.

And, he has done so, beautifully!The man who brought us E.T. and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND has shown us the flip side of what might happen to us if we _don't_ have a first contact where we prove just as amicably curious as the extra-terrestrial beings we someday hope will openly visit us.The CGI being, in this case, looks like a cross between Sebulba the Dug and the Cloverfield Monster. But, he/she/it is undeniably _way_ scarier than both! Fortunately, we (as in, all six billion of us) are saved from a fate worse than SKYLINE by the unbiased compassion and understanding of children supposedly too young-to-know-better.Elle Fanning (younger sister of Dakota "THE TAKEN" Fanning) is convincingly tear-jerking as Alice Dearden. The tomboy daughter of the man that Joe Lamb's father (Kyle "EARLY EDITION" Chandler) holds responsible for the industrial accident in which his wife (Joe's mother) was killed. And, as for Joel Courtney who plays young Joe, himself?He just plain out-Elliot's Henry Thomas.In short; if the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences doesn't nominate this for Best Picture proper, at next year's Oscars? I'm switching channels!

I absolutely wanted to see a fun movie today and I got my wish. I was young enough to have E.T. dolls when that movie arrived to steal the hearts of children everywhere. I am thrilled to have left the theatre today with the same feel good sense that I had then, albeit with enough fright and vulgarity to make me realize this isn't a family film. Well done by all. this child of the '80s just loved every minute of it. I laughed out loud often enough to be down right embarrassed among strangers. I also gasped more than once loud enough that I had to question whether I had actually screamed. So so entertaining. You will not be disappointed.

This is one of the summer's strongest entries and well worth seeing. The kids are for the most part great, and it's even more amazing when you consider that some of them are in their first feature film. Spielberg's influence is very evident and the alien monster looks so much like the one from Cloverfield that I began to wonder if there were unstated connections between the two films. In any case, I like both films, but this one is the better. It obviously had a larger budget and thankfully left out the shaky hand-held camera techniques.If you like science fiction films that intend to tug at your heart strings, this is a don't miss film. It's not perfect but never fails to hold your attention and make sense.

I have to admit this was better than I expected. I love the whole concept of teens making a movie throughout this whole film. The story was decent but it just felt like a remake of E.T. except the alien isn't friendly. At first it didn't bother me not to see the creature but as the time went on, you get a bit anxious and then I was disappointed. It was just another family film where the dad doesn't get along with the kid or understand each other but I couldn't help but see a bit resemblance to Jurassic Park. Oh but the ending, man, was that just sad. I mean, wow, talk about a remake of E.T. BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, it's better than Star trek. I also enjoyed the credits, that was original.

Truly an original story coming from the masters of sci-fi. But please do not take young children it had some language and jurassic park scary moments. I would have liked to see a bigger part between the alien and the boy, because thats what I was kind of expecting after all steven spelberg did make ET. It was also nice to see Kyle Chandler in a movie. The only thing that might concern me for this movie is its target audience. It's very sci-fi I do not think older people would be interested and younger people would not either. Very refreshingly different it was funny, scary, and action packed. When the movie was over I was shocked that two hours had gone by. Oh and stay tuned at the credits they have a funny little video worth watching.

I simply cannot understand how someone who is clearly talented can put together an hour or more of really fun summer movie and then blow it.The homages to Jaws, Close Encounters, and E.T. are a real hoot but really ring hollow when you start to see the chinks in the films armor. The interaction between the children and the period costumes and set design are the star of this movie, not the script. The monster and his tale of trying to get home are simply there to push the narrative and it is clear that Abrams has no joy in telling that story.Once the girl disappears from the group the film basically loses all energy, the characters begin to act erratically, and the suspension of disbelief is exhausted.I wonder what Spielberg must have thought previewing the final cut of this film. Did he shift in his seat and wince at the absurd ending? Did he think of ways he could have done it better?I'd love to see Spielberg go back to making movies like this. It will never happen. And it's a shame, because he did it better than anyone.

SUPER 8! I went into this movie with big expectations and I have to say it didn't disappoint but I will say right off the bat though that the alien did disappoint me.First off the alien. It looks like a mini version of the CLOVERFIELD monster. It's only like approx 20-Feet-Tall and is only shown at the end of the movie. Plus it picks up the main actor and then puts him down and leaves to go back to it's planet... What The F**k!Secondly the movie. JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg created genius here! This movie is brilliantly scripted with a mix of horror, comedy and romance. Think THE GOONIES meets CLOVERFIELD. THE GOONIES as in the kids are the main actors. And CLOVERFIELD as in you don't really see the alien until the end of the movie.Even though there are kids in this movie so you think it shouldn't be too bad. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TOO THIS! It even freaked me out at moments and I usually think horror movies are funny. If you want your kids to sleep at night don't let them see this.Overall 8/10 GREAT MOVIE =)

I loved this movie. It reminded me quite a lot of Spielberg's early work especially of E.T. I thought JJ's work as a director and writer was terrific. In my opinion the movie was quite balanced which makes it appealing to people from all ages. I thought the subjects of friendship, family and love were handled perfectly. In this movie of science fiction, aliens and some incredible special effects, I found the perfect representation of that moment in life when your life changes in the case of this movie the first crush you ever have, the moment when you stop being a kid. I think that JJ and Spielberg know how to work together, I really do hope they do something else in the future. With what Hollywood has become this past years, it is hard to find a truly good movie, the kind that stays with you and reminds you why you loved films in the first place, this is one of those movies. I often watch older movies such as Indiana Jones or Back to the Future and I ask myself, why don't they do them this good anymore? Today seeing Super 8 I found a movie that is just that, an original movie as good as those from past years, I am positive it will become a classic.

So, I went to the movie after watching the trailer several times. I wasn't sure what to expect, since from the trailers, it looks like a "monster-attacking" movie, but I thought they wouldn't use kids as main characters if it's just like that.So, anyways, after about half an hour, I realized that this is going to be a good movie (or at least the type of movie that I will enjoy). The reason is, first, there is a fair amount of character building, which I think is always a key element of good movie. Second, the performance of these kids are amazing, especially the girl (you will see when you watch it). And also, the music gives this movie a big boost.You will probability say some of the scene doesn't make sense, like, "I will never do this", or, "how can he do that", that might drag you away for a couple of second from enjoying it. That's why I would rather call this movie a fairy tale (with a lot of modern filming technologies). It actually recalls me when I watched "Stand by me" a while ago, it is really just watching these kids doing their adventure and you feel like you are a kid again.I guess I said enough about it, you have to watch it yourself. But if you expect this to be a summer blockbuster with a lot of monsters and explosions, this might not be the right movie for you. I'm just a movie goer, I watch all kinds of movies and I enjoyed this one. I think it's this summer's best one up to now. It would be a good movie for a family to watch too.

I like this movie. I really do, honest. Most of the blockbusters are mostly solid while most of the others are ho-hum. However, J.J. Abrams has performed a summer movie miracle. In the process of creating a homage of Steven Spielberg movies, he has crafted an extremely entertaining film that has a heart as big as its thrills.I won't describe the juiciest bits of the story here, since they'll spoil the public. All I can tell you is that it's about kids making a movie using their Super 8 camera, something mysterious happen, strange things start to happen. Having said that, the screenplay is well written, most notably the dialog by the children which is funny, witty and engaging. I especially admire the children's attention to detail - like finding production value for their movie. The way they make their own little movie is a touching, heartfelt ode to the filmmakers who also started out that way. Makes anyone, young or old, want to make their own movies again if they haven't already.It's an amazing feat when all of the child actors perform especially well in their roles, and actually make you care about them, and bring you into their adventure. I really hope all child actors will get good, promising careers in the future. In addition, it's nice to see Kyle Chandler on the big screen again.Abrams pulled it off here, not only in writing the screenplay but directing the movie as well with care and focus. He has direction that would make Spielberg proud. Of course, with Spielberg himself producing the film it's no surprise that the entire film feels like a genuine Spielberg movie, the kind of adventure movie that he would make before "Schindler's List" changed him into a bona-fide serious filmmaker (not that that's a bad thing). We've come a long way since adventure films like "E.T." and "The Goonies", but Spielberg and Abrams prove that old school works, and works well. The well-rendered CGI and some spectacular action sequences are actually overshadowed by the mystery, story and characters, proving once again that eye candy is no match for a big heart and good ol' fashioned storytelling.With good cinematography, production design and a John William-esque score by Michael Giacchino, "Super 8" is the best of the blockbusters, maybe for the summer, maybe for 2011 itself (I still patiently await Spielberg's own "Tintin"). One thing's for sure, in terms of pure entertainment, this is perfect. It has that rare blockbuster movie magic, and I would not be surprised if "Super 8" was nominated for Best Picture at next year's Oscars. No, I'm not joking, and I'm certainly not exaggerating.If J.J. Abrams can keep this up, he would be a potential successor to Steven Spielberg. And lastly, stay for the credits.Overall rating: 86/100

I went to school in 1979 - as the kids were running from the school, I felt like I was right back there. There were only a couple of phrases that I felt were from a later year, but the time period felt very authentic. With a small exception... most of the cars were American gas hog cars... there were very few Toyotas, VW bugs etc... I remember seeing a lot of those back then too.I have 3 sons, all love sci-fi, math, nerdy stuff... so watching 5 young nerdy boys made me feel right at home. The relationship between Joel Courtney (Watch out Bieber!) and Riley Griffiths was very authentic. I wish I could see them 15 years from now, still best friends and talking about 'that train wreck'...I am quite amazed that this film was made as cheaply as it was. It plays like a much more expensive film. I guess the lack of big name stars really helped with the budget. It was very smart on their part... I saw the characters as who they were playing rather than who I knew them to be.Kyle Chandler baby! Where have you been all of my life! Wish they had given you a love interest in the movie too... (although I guess that would have messed with the whole missing the just departed wife plot line)... OK, I forgive them... but when they release the directors edition, perhaps we can see some past scenes between you and your wife, a la Casper? "The Day the Earth Stood Still" didn't make you a star... Grey's Anatomy cut your part short... hopefully Super 8 will launch you finally...Elle Fanning reminded me more of a young Lindsay Lohan with blonde hair than her sister Dakota Fanning whom was highly annoying 6 years ago in War of the Worlds. Elle was not annoying in the slightest. It was nice to see an actual 13 year old playing one on screen.I knew when I laughed during the first scene (the funeral) that I was going to enjoy the movie. The theater was crowded and it was great to hear everyone laughing from beginning to end. I wish half of the audience hadn't left before the kid's super 8 movie was shown... It was adorable.Anything that has the name J.J. Abrams on it makes me want to see it. As a very devoted fan of Lost (which I only got hooked on because I enjoyed Alias) any scene in the movie that reminded me of Lost (mostly the monster in the tree scenes and the black and white films) made me miss it again. Of course the tree scenes were also reminiscent of Jurassic Park so I knew exactly when to look away from the screen (usually when it got real quiet...)The "love" story between the two teenagers didn't quite play right. It was obvious he had a crush on her, not so much the other way around. I'm glad they didn't try to stick a kiss in there, it would have been awkward. I could see them as very close friends throughout school.The scene where he is trying to hold on to the locket lasted way too long and the music was too sappy... We got it... don't pound us over the head with it.So this alien has been on earth for over 20 years and has yet to build his ship to return home... but all of a sudden at the end of the movie, voilà, the ship is built and off he goes... Ummm, what took him so long? Why hadn't he left before? That needed some explaining... I wasn't so sure why after such an amazing movie they had to rush the ending... it wasn't like a commercial was coming up or anything...I think this is the best movie of 2011 so far, the second being Source Code, (if I had to pick one.) There was never a moment during the movie that I didn't want to be sitting there. The last time I felt that way was watching The Social Network last fall.I will be seeing it again in a week, I want to share the experience with my family who haven't seen in yet. I have read it compared to umpteen other movies all of which are seen in snippets throughout, but this movie will definitely stand on its own.

If you haven't seen it yet, don't be fooled by the trailers or TV spots. It's not about the 'thing'. That's why 'Super 8' let me down in the well established subplot. The mystery that had the most hype around it was let down by an ending that was rushed and didn't match the superb, first three quarters. Then again, though this subplot of the story was the most focused on, that didn't matter, cause there were so many other things to love about this throwback to old Spielberg.The characters were well developed throughout the entire film. Joel Courtney, who plays the protagonist Joe, had never acted before. And look at the performance he put up! The real star however is Elle Fanning, who plays Alice. She does tremendously within the diversity of the film. The other children and Kyle Chandler, who plays Joe's father Jackson, were all fantastic too. The contribution of these actors who are not so high profile was a highlight of this movie.Aside from the monster and blowing up of crap, what I adored was adventure, something that every kid wanted back when there wasn't Call of Duty. The story of the protagonists provokes great memories that we all had. Also, there is a human element that is delivered through Joe and Jackson's point of view. Which I wouldn't want to spoil.Finally, don't let the ending get you down. Super 8 does in fact lives up to its anticipated monster mayhem. The attacks were extremely frightening, especially the intense bus scene. We cannot forget the stunning, unforgettable train crash that is by far the greatest action sequence this year.Overall, this film started off like a masterpiece, but you should have particular expectations in order to enjoy it for all it has.Be prepared for a scary, funny, touching, action-packed movie that will make you feel young all over again. Super 8 proves to be the best film this summer.

Producer Steven Spielberg took novice director J.J. Abrams ("Mission: Impossible III," "Star Trek") for a ride with his newest production, "Super 8," and man was it a trip. The veteran helmer - who won Academy Awards for his World War II pictures, "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan" - reaches back into his earliest efforts to bring to life a screenplay he had tucked away for decades.Abrams utilizes elements of "Jaws," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial" and "The Goonies" (written but not directed by Spielberg), among others in this story of a group of small town Ohio preteens making a zombie movie for a super 8 film contest in the summer of 1979. The picture also bears a passing resemblance to 2006's "Cloverfield," but please don't let THAT fact frighten you away.Led by Charles (Riley Griffith), the brains behind the project, the cast includes sensitive makeup artist and go-fer, Joe Lamb (newcomer Joel Courtney) - who lost his mother in a steel mill accident four months earlier. Others involved in making the movie-within-a-movie are zombie actor, Cary (Ryan Lee), bumbling detective, Martin (Gabriel Basso), the detective's "wife," Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning, Dakota's little sis, "Because Of Winn-Dixie") and befuddled extra, Preston (Zach Mills).While filming a touching "love" scene at a railroad depot late one night, the kids are witness to a horrible train derailment - possibly caused by one of their biology teachers (Glynn Turman). The small super 8-mil. camera, however, witnesses something much more sinister. Thank goodness Abrams followed the example of "Jaws" and "Alien" (and NOT "Cloverfield") by waiting until the end of the proceedings before revealing the entity.Air Force personnel soon begin streaming into the town to contain the damage caused by the derailment - as well as the curiosity of local law enforcement - especially deputy sheriff, Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler, "King Kong," "The Kingdom"), whose relationship with his son is strained to the breaking point. Headed by fanatical Col. Nelec (Noah Emmerich "The Truman Show," "Miracle," "Little Children"), the military unit wants to find whatever escaped the wreck that night, even if it means spreading fraudulent information or causing a fake panic and evacuation.Alice soon disappears and while in Air Force custody, the kids get a close up look at what the boys in blue are after. Abrams is not above throwing a few new tricks into the mix here, but stays faithful to his mentor's love affair with the good side of aliens and the often dark heart of human nature. The children are funny, touching and heart-tuggingly real, just like most of Spielberg's young actors (with the exception of the kid who played "Short Round" in "Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom"), and the "love affair" between Joe and Alice is simple and sweet, just like the way we remember our first crushes were.Adults in this feature range from super good to unbelievably evil, but there is a nice twist with Alice's father, Louis (Ron Eldard, "Scent Of a Woman," "Blackhawk Down") and deputy Lamb. Meanwhile, David Gallagher, the cute little blonde kid from the TV series "Seventh Heaven," has a field day as a stoner film store clerk.Overall, a nice time at the cinema with plenty of laughs to go along with some genuinely frightening moments. Abrams also bring a deft hand to directing kids here, whose stories vastly overshadow the plights of the grown-up population. And for those who like to slip out of the theatre right when the credits begin to roll, give yourself a few minutes at the conclusion of "Super 8," when the children's homemade film project, "The Case," is revealed in its entirety.It's a wonderful way to wrap up a very good summer edition to the season's blockbuster lineup.

Excellent family film, even better than I hoped! The child actors stole every scene and every moment they were in. Even during scary parts their antics had the audience and myself in stitches! Really reminded me of the Goonies with a sci-fi edge to it. Not to mention that for most kids who were between 12-15 in the 80's the whole thing felt authentic, I think most of us had the same toys and into the same thing as these kids. I was expecting a fun sci-fi film but they gave it a bit of a trip down memory lane, playing with our parents Super 8 camera making goofy movies. I already can't wait till the DVD release, or maybe just go and see it again in theaters.

I went into this movie knowing it was PG-13 which nowadays means scary for a 13yo and little violence and if anyone does get killed it's off screen or blurred. There are one or 2 deaths that are violent enough to border on an r rating but everything else is kiddie. The special effects and shock moments that have you jump are not bad but they alone cant carry this movie. Some of the acting is pretty bad and it drags quite frequently. The kids act better than the adults and their range of emotion is why I didn't lower my rating even more. The ending is typical Spielberg schtick and a definite cop out as if they couldn't figure out how to end it and maybe threw ideas into a hat and picked one. I saw it in an IMAX theater which I'd recommend especially for the train crash scene or you'll miss the feel of it. Overall a 7/10 , the kids acting is a 10 the rest of the movie is a 4.

OMG, if you wanted to combine all genres of movies together you get super 8. It has all the right technical aspects, time period realism, good direction & acting,& special effects, but the story & lines are a crock. The movie was slow, people were actually fidgeting in their seats, the lines were wooden, & the believability factor was dead zero. How could JJ get it so wrong, the script is so predicable, & the alien looked like he was stolen from the aliens movies. You would think if you do an alien film, at least re-invent the wheel, don't use someone else's alien.There is no mystery to this film, except that it is so bad.It will only get you in because of Spielberg & JJ, & the cryptic ads This film may have been believed in the 80's, but now people have moved on beyond aliens, & government conspiracies & cover-ups, this film failed on script & story, it is too clichéd & cheesy.JJ you can do much better, & you have done much better, look at Star Trek, there was not one remotely funny moment in this film. I need to see another film just to was out the bad taste in the mouth of this one. Give me ET, or Close Encounters any time.

What a disappointment! I waited 8 months for this! The 1st reviewer "Rick Swift" must lay out JJ's Armani and run his bath water, because comparing this film to "Stand by Me" is a disservice to the reader. In a nutshell, movie started slow, it did not have an even flow, to many seams. The young actors did a noble job for 1st timers. Creature had "zero" imagination that will remind you of another. by the way, it understands the English language. The down fall of this film was the hype that it definitely did not live up to. From the super secret plot to the viral campaign, which in fact were more interesting than the film itself. Actually, the best part about the film is the "mini clip" when the credits role. JJ and Steven, I am returning my rocket poppeteers astronaut training certificate. I wish you luck recovering the 45 million you invested.

Coming out of Super 8, I felt as though it was the early 80's again, or sometime in my own childhood. That is not because it was set in the early 80's, however. It's because J.J. Abrams engineered a style of film that reminded me of a monster movie formula of the 60's combined with a science fiction formula of the 70's and early 80's. It definitely has a Spielbergian echo, with thematic homages to movies Spielberg directed like E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Jaws, and produced in his early years like Poltergeist, Gremlins, and The Goonies (when he was more creatively involved). Monster movie motifs were found all over the place, ranging from zombie flicks (the type of Super 8 movie the kids were making) to Them and Earth vs The Spider, as well as cult SF alien invasion movies like Invaders From Mars.Abrams thankfully avoids the shaky-cam trend of modern movie making and takes more time setting up shots and angles that work in the moment, another Spielberg and Hitchcock style I wish more directors would adapt.That is not to say that Super 8 isn't original. Every child carries genes of his or her parents, grandparents and ancestors, but is still unique. It is a great adventure movie featuring a group of kids doing things not unlike what I tried to do when I was young (but with a lot better resources than were available to me), and so it reached me personally not only in style but in content.For younger audiences, who may not have even been born until the mid-80's (or later), and who haven't taken the time to watch movies from earlier years, should find it fresh, fun and interesting, and unlike your typical Michael Bay action film, easy to watch.No matter how it performs in today's box office climate, I think Super 8 will prove to be a classic in later years.

Super 8 is a great thrill ride involving teenagers and a monster. The film is about a bunch of teenagers trying to make a film in the year 1979. During filming, they witness an accident involving a car and a train. After that, mysterious things begin to happen like people disappearing. It reminds me of JJ's Cloverfield, except the monster in this film is different. Unlike Cloverfield, this monster actually has a heart when he decides not to kill a boy who was trying to sweet talk him. Yes this monster can actually listen to you. Special mention should go for the special effects and sound. It was as if I was actually there in the quiet and dark petrol station when the monster starts attacking.I was prepared to give the movie a rating of 9/10, but changed my mind when I saw the climax, which I cannot accept. The climax is that the monster actually builds a spaceship and uses it to go home. It feels so ET and I feel that this ending should not be in this movie. I would recommend this movie for those who loves a suspenseful thriller and I am giving this movie a rating of 7/10 just because of the climax. This is truly the best thriller of the year.

I find going to the movies to be among life's greatest treats. For me, there are few things as enjoyable as a trip to the theater. That being said, my enthusiasm for movie watching has been ratcheted up significantly by my newly appointed "go to" movie date.My son and I have been watching movies together for the better part of the last six years but recently, at 9 years of age, he's taken an interest and I feel that he is mature enough, to go with me to a wider variety of films.I preface my thoughts regarding Super 8 with these nuggets because, at a time that I am introducing my son to film, it reminded me of why I love movies so much.JJ Abrams has created a "Speilbergian" adventure that touches and thrills. Super 8 is not without imperfection but the minor issues that I saw as flaws are so insignificant that they aren't even worth mentioning.The cast is remarkable. The children are fun, funny and believable in their roles. I could watch these kids have lunch at a diner any time, even if they weren't discussing fascinating plot points. The movie makers capture dialogue between kids in a way that immediately brings you back to that stage of life. We all either fit the bill ourselves or had friends that fit reminded us someone in this gang.Kyle Chandler is at his Friday Night Lightiest, as the Deputy Sheriff and resident distant Dad.Joel Courtney (Joe) is this generation's Elliot. It is a timeless performance by a new young actor that I hope to see for some time to come.Elle Fanning (Alice) is.. perfect.The story is a mix of the best aspects of Cloverfield, E.T., Goonies and The Iron Giant. The action sequences are fantastic, brace yourself for the train scene. You care about the characters and their well being, a Spielberg staple, and a rare occurrence in today's summer movie world. Then of course there is the "visitor" that the movie is centered around. No spoilers here, trust me that part is good too.This is a movie to make time for. If you have plans, change them and run to the theater. Tell your friends to do the same. If you can see it in an IMAX theater, even better. You will not regret it the couple extra dollars.Those of us who go to the movies with their family. We will all benefit from a movie like Super 8 being wildly successful. Super hero movies are fun, Pixar is breaking new ground every year but movies like Super 8 have been sorely missed.There are good movies you can take your family to but this one is great and I can only hope that there will be more like it.

After seeing this film I've been overwhelmed by both Wonder and Awe, and disappointment.And that is what this movie was. I don't even need to describe the first half of the film. It just pure 70s and 80s movie magic. Albeit a bit slow up until the train crash, which may be one of the best action scenes I've seen in a movie for YEARS, but after that it moves along just fine. The child actors are wonderful, believable, and hilarious. Deputy Lamb and the other father character are great. The only character who proves weak and annoying was the Air force colonel, or captain, or whatever he is. His character was so underdeveloped and badly written that I found that every scene that he was in was hindered by him.The Alien attacks are mysterious and creepy, exactly what I wanted going into the movie. Another great scene is when the police (I actually enjoyed the moderately humorous group of local cops as much as I enjoyed the kids) are jotting down the locations of the scores of dogs who have fled from their homes and the dots create a perfect circle around the town. That is what movies like this should be like. That is sci-fi mystery movie wonder. Scenes like this continue to carry the film for a quite a while, and it is not until the final fourth that everything starts to go wrong.First of all, when the train crashed at the beginning many little white cubes spilled out of crates from the rail cars, and the main character ends up with one in his room. Eventually these things come into play.The scene that marks the beginning of this fourth part is when Deputy Lamb is in military custody. While he is being escorted to the bathroom, Lamb suddenly knocks out the soldier, steals his M-16, and before you know it he's dressed up in a us army uniform and is blowing up a truck as a distraction so he can escape the base. Now, this scene comes out of nowhere and is the first of many that feel a bit out of place. Earlier in the film he is seen being arrested by the military, but this was MUCH earlier. It's as though Abrams either forgot about it, or was ignoring it because he realized that he had written himself into a corner and finally he just used whatever excuse he could think of to get Lamb out of the base and back to town.Soon after that the kids break into the trailer of their old teacher Mr. Woodward, the man who intentionally crashed the train, and they find plenty of film footage and evidence. They find out through old films that Woodward was in the military and that the air force was holding the alien captive. Apparently the creature is psychic and can communicate through touch. So when it lifts Woodward ten feet off the ground and promptly drops him, he immediately knows that... the alien just wants to go home on its space ship but the army won't let it. Fantastic. All of my expectations were crushed at that point in favor of the oldest alien storyline in the book. But getting past that, they see that those little white cubes can form solid metal and then dissolve into cubes again in the blink of an eye. And so when all of the cubes, including the one in the main character's room, fly toward the town water tower, it's a safe bet that that's where the ship is going to be. They also learn that the creature is subterranean, and they find the entrance to the alien's cave and discover what looks like the skeleton of a space ship being built inside. Not to mention the bodies of several towns people hanging from the ceiling. These are two things that are confusing and never make sense. One being, if the alien is building a ship out of the little white things, of which there are plenty, why is he also building this thing underground? Never explained. Also, there is a shot in this scene where the alien is holding what APPEARS to be a human leg close to his mouth, and one of the kids says, "He's eating people!" Ironically this line actually gave me hope that the movie would stay on a darker course, and the rest of the scene where the alien chucks two people to what must certainly be their deaths gave me more hope. But then, just when I was hoping for something spectacular as the children are cornered by the alien, the least spectacular thing that could possibly happen happens. The kid talks to it and it walks away. Thrilling, isn't it.So yes, it appears that it is a nice alien now, and as stated before, all it wants to do is go home. And that is why that scene confused me. One second he's supposedly eating people and the next he's shooed off by a little boy. surrounding this scene there are some good action shots of the military blowing everything up as the kids run for their lives, but these are soon abandoned for the final, terribly anticlimactic scene. The alien climbs to the tops of the water tower, gets in its ship, and flies away.But even then, that leaves three fourths of good,solid, summer action movie magic! So why does this one fourth seem to consume so much of what I have to say about this movie? Because everything else was fantastic, so naturally I expected a fantastic ending. And that is why I feel so disappointed right now. Out of all of the parts that they could have slipped up on, they chose the most important.

It's worth seeing on the big screen, but I have to admit I expected a bit more from JJ and Stevie Boy. Nice period touches that give you the look and feel of 1979. Couple that with the teenage cast and you have something that will attract older and younger audiences (that is, making more money for JJ and Stevie). The plot would have been just as effective in any other time period; I just saw the temporal placement as a worn-out way to maximize the age range of the audience.I just had one little "nit-pick" that only a ham radio operator would notice. In the movie was shown an old (circa 1960) Heathkit Seneca that was being used to intercept the shortwave transmissions from the "gub-mint" guys. The problem is that the Seneca was a transmitter only, not a receiver. A similar mistake was made in the movie "Frequency" where the main character was using a Heath SB-301 to talk across time to his father. Guess what? The SB-301 is a receiver, not a transmitter. I know; I have one in my basement.At least ham radio got a favorable moment in the movie when the older man stepped forward at the town meeting. The movie overall is well worth seeing, but don't expect to be blown away by the plot. My favorite character was the kid with the braces (I can't remember his name) who loved to blow up stuff. He added a touch of comedy to an otherwise extremely serious story.

I don't plan on using spoilers but any information about this movie is a spoiler.I went into this movie with astounding expectations, and all were met. JJ Abrams mixes the suspense Spielberg created in Close Encounters with the heart in ET, however Super 8 has arguably more heart, and adds the action Abrams used in Star Trek. The key to Super 8's success is the children. The kids are by far the best actors in the movie. They have great range, which they use in this movie, and are simply fantastic. The movie is so focused on the children because Abrams is showing how beautiful imagination is, not just at a young age but when we grow up. The sci-fi is good, the alien idea has been done again and again, but the focus does not revolve around the monster but instead focuses on the kids. The movie is not about the alien but instead the growth of the children. The bottom line is, Super 8 is more about youth and imagination. Much like the kids are making a monster movie Abrams is making his own. The heart Abrams puts in the movie makes Super 8 more than just an action or sci-fi movie. In Super 8 Abrams did a better job than Spielberg. He took the heart and childlike wonder Spielberg had in ET and Close Encounters and merged it with a story and action only JJ Abrams could pull off. Side Note: I saw this movie in IMAX and the sound was phenomenal. I recommend seeing this movie in theaters and if possible in IMAX.

A group of kids are making a zombie monster movie. They get more than they bargained for when a REAL monster shows up in their small town, courtesy of the U.S.A.F. and a spectacular train wreck.Set in the 1970s, SUPER 8 is filled with references to disco, new wave— Blondie's "Rapture," the Knack's "My Sharona"—and CB radios. It's also filled with references to Steven Spielberg movies from the era—E.T.: THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, JAWS, even THE GOONIES—not surprising, given the producer. Unfortunately, writer/director Abrams can't escape Spielberg's penchant for sentimentality. There are not one but two single, dysfunctional fathers raising alienated, resentful children. Needless to say, they will all learn valuable life lessons by the time the movie's over. Those expecting another CLOVERFIELD will be disappointed. The best part of SUPER 8 is THE CASE—the kid's zombie monster movie-within-a-movie— which screens during the closing credits.

The film is about a town mystery looked through the eyes of children. From the early part of the movie, you feel like something powerful and dangerous is lurking around and is going to jump out on you at any moment. Ever-multiplying questions tease your brain and a suspense is building up at the back of your mind right up to the end of the story. The acting was very convincing and drawing although the movie suffers from its mediocre ending. A few times I felt that the logic and the flow of the plot were a bit unrealistic and artificial. I wish that the story was focused more on the mystery and the children's reactions without all the insignificant distractions and one-dimensional minor characters. After being disappointed by a series of recent movies, this one was refreshing and heart-fluttering. It flings us back to the adventure-seeking and truth-chasing time of our childhood. If you are into tantalizing sci-fi thrillers like this movie, I recommend 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks' as your summer read.

I have no idea why we decided to go for this movie ! There is nothing more to know about the movie than what we already know. Train Crash + Alien ... anyone who reads the plot already knows that. There are a few thing which happen in the movie which are totally unexplained till the end. After the movie is over, you come out and start wondering ,what did this scene happen for ? Why did so and so happen ? Anyways , the worst part and the best part of the movie are together. It's the last 5 minutes of the movie which are crappy, while it's the best part coz you are very happy that the movie has finally ended. I am still giving this a 3/10 , because I really liked the first 15 minutes which end with the train crash. After that the movie really crashes !

Instead of presenting this as a normal review, I'll put it in the form of bullets. I just think it's more reader-friendly for this. It also helps to avoid plot details, and that's probably better if you want to go in with a blank slate.1. If you like Steven Spielberg, you'll like this movie. J.J. Abrams has clearly created the movie as a homage to the classics that Spielberg has made. Echoes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Jurassic Park are felt throughout the entire film. Super 8 directly borrows Jaws' style in that the viewer only gets brief glimpses at the monster for the first two thirds; it isn't until the last third that the viewer sees it in its entirety.2. The acting. Elle Fanning is the highlight of a great cast of child actors. Fanning has proved herself once with Somewhere, but she ups the ante with Super 8. There's one great scene where she has to act as though she's acting in a movie filmed by the other children. She, along with the rest of them, nails it.3. J.J. Abrams' script. The writing is one of the best things about Super 8. It's rich, fast, and, again, Spielbergian. Abrams' screenplay is delightful because it plays on the viewer's own childhood memories. It's basically one long nostalgia trip.4. J.J. Abrams' direction. He basically becomes Steven Spielberg to make this movie, as seen in his use of constant Steadicam shots and visual restraint when it comes to the shots of the monster in the early parts of the movie.5. The cinematography and color palette. Also reminiscent of 1970s blockbuster film is the visual look of the movie. The drowned-out colors are similar to that of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.6. The train sequence. The best scene in the movie is one involving a train crash. It's basically what you've already seen from the first trailer, but this time, it's from a different point-of-view. Watch this in a big theater. You're going to want to hear how great the sound editing is in this scene.7. The monster. I'm not going to say anything other than that I very much enjoyed the way the monster looked.8. The tone. Like The Goonies, Super 8 is a summer movie that's made to make you feel like a kid again. It's wonderful, at times whimsical and at other times frightening. It's exactly what one should want from a summer movie, but...Reasons why not to see Super 8: 1. J.J. Abrams got too bogged down in becoming Steven Spielberg. The film is sometimes obnoxious in how much it wants to be Jaws. This ends up getting in the way of the film's great story, and keeps it from becoming a classic.2. It's not perfect. Super 8 has pacing issues a lot of the time and will often involve characters and subplots that completely unnecessary. There are certain elements of the movie that could have absolutely been taken away without any repercussions.Overall, Super 8 is worth seeing. Take the family out and have fun. See it in a big theater with a good sound system. It's a fun but unfortunately forgettable ride.

i have to say film had potential to be the next ET but failed even getting close to it. on the positive side it had good acting from the cast so downfall of this film was not their fault. directing was way of target film jumped from one place to another. effects are not worth mentioning action was almost not there. they did not know what to make of the monster so he was bad killer one minute softy the next. it was the last few minutes you actually see him or the thing even then i was not impressed. so would not have paid to see this at pictures rather wait for DVD version to see and decide. where it stands it is a one time watch

*****Spoiler Alert***** When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I could not wait to see it. Every time I saw this trailer, I had goosebumps. That did not change when I first saw this film. This movie grips you and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie is very well acted, which is surprising since there are many young actors in the film. Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning really had break-out roles in this film, especially Joel Courtney. He is perfect in this movie and really makes it a great movie. Kyle Chandler also plays the 'grieving father' role perfectly. At the end, when Joel Courtney(Joe Lamb) and Kyle Chandler(Jack Lamb) hug for the first time, and when he lets go of his necklace, I cried. I am a teenage male and have never cried while seeing a movie, which only proves how much of an affect this movie has on the viewer. I definitely recommend seeing this movie.

The concept of "Super 8" is combining the elements of J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg. The trailer made you think it's like E.T. plus Cloverfield. Well, it's true. There is nothing new about "Super 8" but it brought us back to the good old classic times, it's funny, it's exciting, and it's amazing."Super 8" is another intriguing monster movie by J.J. Abrams. Yes, you really wanna know what it looks like but I'm not gonna tell you. The sad thing is it's not as intriguing as Cloverfield. But It's easy to ignore that problem because there is something better than being another Cloverfield. It feels like you are watching a good old classic movie. Great characters, Good old fashion score, and kids intrigued by the situation.The story is really about the characters' zombie movie making and the family tragedy while there's a monster attacking their town. The monster is like the background or the subplot of this film. But the movie still got suspense. The movie is indeed beautiful and plenty of heart. The movie is just nostalgic stuff. It's not trying to be new. It just wants to show how J.J. Abrams is inspired by Steven Spielberg's movies.There are some amazing scenes in this film. Example, the train collision was breathtaking. The movie sure has a lot of humor. It's like a relic to the old family movies. The CGI is good enough. The performances were good. The kids gave a lot of personality to their roles."Super 8" is a J.J. Abrams film with Spielberg's trademarks all over it. It's not a blockbuster that has a lot of action and less talking. This movie is made in old fashion style. Yep, this movie is nostalgic if you saw Spielberg's old movies and it's good to see another one like it.Note: There is something interesting in the credits. You might wanna check it out.

Super 8 derails all the infantile movie-making of explosion artists and delivers a nostalgic return to the subtleties of cinema.In retrospect, it's funny to think that Steven Spielberg was condemned by many of his contemporaries during the '70s and '80s, that movies of such material merit were criticized of stripping Hollywood of its depth and reducing substance to spectacle. We can only laugh at at the thought of what those same detractors would think of filmmakers like Michael Bay. But Spielberg was, and still is, far from a simple manufacturer of parlour tricks; he was a master storyteller, capable of photographing our most closeted fears and intimate imaginations. Produced by Amblin Entertainment and Bad Robot Productions, and distributed by Paramount, J.J Abrams now aims to pay tribute to the man, his method, and its magic.In a run-of-the-mill Spielbergian suburbia in 1979, Joel Courtney is Joe Lamb, a timid kid with an estranged father (Kyle Chandler), a recently deceased mother, and a fat filmmaker for a friend (Riley Griffiths). When they're not at school, Joe and the aforesaid weighty Charles make movies and talk movies. Accompanied by their two buddies and the intimidating companionship of a young belle (Elle Fanning), the adolescent Hollywood aspirants take to the night to shoot their 8mm zombie flick.Super 8's first act is pure pleasure and a joy for the juvenile in all of us especially for those of us who made movies when we were a kid. Pressed for time in the late hours of the night, telling your friends to shut up and stop screwing around because you're running out of film, arguing for twenty minutes about whether to go for a close-up or a medium it's impossible to suppress a smile.Cue all hell breaking loose. A speeding train springs from its tracks in a massive crash and, unbeknownst to the crew, a perverse E.T. frees itself from one of the cars, setting into motion the military occupancy of the small Ohio town. The rest of the runtime centres on many of Super 8's characters coming to grips with unresolved family issues, notably the Spielberg-trademark of fathers and their sons, and a straightforward 'damsel-in-distress' finale.Closer to the third kind beings of Encounters than the central titular alien in the Extra-Terrestrial, the creature in Super 8 is more of a MacGuffin monster. It doesn't play a real role except to act as a catalyst for the maturation of Joe, his friends, and their families. It drives the plot forward like a chauffeur not really there, and you don't really care you just want to get to where you're headed. This excuses the fact that the alien is not nearly as memorable as notable others, although Abrams does well in adhering to the principle of what you don't see is more frightening than what you do see, as blurring and obscure angles prevent you from almost never having a clear view of the monster, making it all the more menacing.From a technical standpoint, Super 8 is a virtuoso comparable with the works of the maestro it models. Whether it's the mechanical madness of a tank crushing the innocence of a child's playground, or the seldom shot of a silhouette against the skyline, the images here compliment, rather than dominate the established world. Frankness forgiven, I've said it once and I'll say it again movies with balls are nothing without heart. The explosive images employed here are powerful because Abrams understands the principle that we don't give two f**** about a propane tank exploding we care about the people that the blast could harm. Of course speaking of our director, what would an Abrams film be without a hundred lens flares, except that this time the visual device is actually relevant, continually reminding you that you're watching a movie and that's what this one's all about.The awe and wonder of Super 8's legendary producer trump the cheap cookie-cutter 'blow it up and they'll keep entertained' strategy. Its monster forges these people by being, rather than interacting. Understand this it's not E.T. or Close Encounters it doesn't quite match the sentimentality of those films. Nor does it wield the same amount of scriptwriting focus – I felt as though J.J. was working to too many things instead of one sole objective – but it undeniably possesses the heart of its producer's predecessors, and similarly challenges its heroes to grow up and yet stay young. It tributes Spielberg, the frustrating fun of amateur film-making, but more than anything, it tributes imagination once again And the power of ideas over imagery.

Spent outrageous amount of money to take family this highly touted (by industry controlled) "critics". The movie had NO identity, and I sensed JJ could not decide if he wanted another "ET", Jaws, or some sort of Sandlot sci-fi mixture. The lines by the kids were largely "read" and overambitious to push the cute angle. The middle of the movie was largely boring, and the ending, well- JJ could not decide if you were to feel sorry for the monster or not, and took a shot at a last minute to attempt to do so, but by that time it was like trying to feel sorry for the shark in Jaws...Plane wreck in beginning was high point, and the rest was a different kind of train wreck... wait for the DVD!

Going into Super 8, I was ready to see a movie that would remind me of why I've wanted to become a filmmaker for so long. A movie that would maybe remind me that Hollywood could still provide movies worth actually being put into production. When Super 8 faded to credits, I knew this movie was it.Super 8 was a work of art. I cannot find a weak moment in Super 8. The kids were perfectly cast with Elle Fanning shining the most. She has a bright career ahead of her.Abrams direction was perfect. No actor had a cheesy or bad-acting moment. Also, Abrams script was impressive with such a natural dialog.Michael Giacchino's score was effective. I had my doubts with his ability to put an effective soundtrack together after his critically- acclaimed score for Up won the Academy Award (which I felt did not deserve it at all), but Giacchino put a score worthy to be called as good as John Williams himself.The emotional impact was there, especially with a certain scene where the protagonist and his love interest watch a film reel of the protagonists deceased mother.What I will brag most about Super 8, the crucial thing that made Super 8 a 9 out of 10 instead of a 7 or 8, was the ending. The last 5 minutes, or the closing scene, is one of the most beautiful, awe-inspiring, I have seen in years. I was stunned. I was speechless. Not since maybe Return of the King in 2003 have I seen an ending in theaters that has left me in such an awe.Go see Super 8. The movie will not disappoint. Super 8 is maybe the first step back into having big-budget blockbusters again that were not too long ago that had depth, heart, and character such as Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, Titanic, and even Spider-Man 2.

One of the most boring films I have seen in a long time. It has the Stephen Spielberg lack of subtlety (if there is loud explosion... someone will always exclaim, "wow! that was loud!" There are constant super corny references to the 70s (Farrah hair, CB radios, pintos, walk-men...every appliance is "Harvest Gold" or "Avacado Green." If you can predict the whole plot of the movie within ten minutes. I am further sadden that people have given this movie good reviews. Lots of corny moments with teary eyed kids that are so over the top that don't pull at anyone's heartstrings. I wish the monster had destroyed this town!It was awful.

What the heck is going on!?! Is this movie really being rated GOOD? WOW!!! It's absolutely amazing how money, power, and your name can get you to undeserved heights. This movie was wack, terrible, not good, boring, not deserving of being in any theatre, and just plain awful. I very seldom rate movies, but i always try to rate the really good ones. I like movies of all different genres, so i am not very picky. And i LOVE sci-fi! But this particular movie was not good. I am sorry, but somebody needs to speak the truth. Maybe all of the good reviews were people that got paid to write the review??? If you watch the movie and enjoy, then good for you. The average person would not really care for this movie, that's my opinion. Definitely don't make the mistake of spending more than $3-$5... it's just not worth it. Hope I've been helpful to someone. And let me state for the record, I usually like Abram's and Spielberg's work. Not this time.

This will definitely become one of the surprise hit of summer, 20011. I haven't had so much fun watching a film since first seeing Close Encounters. Although, the movie's title can be quiet misleading, the film itself is a masterpiece. Totally fun, exciting, adventurous, and thrilling. The special effects are mind-blowing, the kid's characters were believable, and the script was written to kept even the most calm natured, on the edge of their seats. The movie is actually a story within a story, but it never loses its sense of reality blended in a very science fictional plot. It's early seventies setting has a sort of magical effect on the senses, a walk down memory lane with some of the hit songs played in the background. Do not cheat yourself. This is a must film for the whole family to see.

I was nineteen years old in 1979 so I can relate to the time this film took place and JJ Abrams does an excellent job in keeping with the times. Although he did have a Sony Walkman in one scene which I felt might have been stretching it a bit. Not that the Walkman didn't exist, it did. Actually Sony introduced the Walkman on July 1, 1979 and technically, the main portion of the film occurs on or around June of 1979. OK, I know, I'm a dork who looks for authenticity in film making when they go to a specific year. However, it wasn't that big of a deal.This is a terrific film and I know you may have seen the ET meets Transformers, or Alien meets Goonies, or other such comparisons. I will say it has Spielberg written all over it, which is a good thing because Spielberg is Spielberg. J J Abrams wrote and directed this film. If he keeps making films like this the film industry will be a better place.So if you like E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Sandlot, Goonies and Alien; you will love this film! Go see it.

I wish I could give this zero stars. The first fifteen minutes were pretty good. The the train crashes and the whole movie just falls apart, bit by bit. I left to get a drink refill, and when I was re-entering the theater a man was leaving, mumbling, "worst movie ever..." I thought he was being too harsh, but by the end, I agree. If you've seen ET, The Goonies, and War of the Worlds, then you've already seen Super 8. It's bits and pieces of other movies, chewed up and glued back together. There is not one iota of originality in this whole sorry film. The last five minutes will leave you vomiting into your shoes. This movie would be maybe 5/10 if it weren't for it's POTENTIAL! With Abrams, Spielberg, and for pete's sake a FANNING! - it should've been awesome. The fact that will all that talent they still managed to produce this enormous piece of poop is what really makes it awful.

One of the things that make certain summers at the movies something more than just an endless stream of special effects blockbusters that promise a lot of bang for your buck, but in the end seem to offer precious little in the way of substance, is that sometimes there is that special kind of "blockbuster" that has everything you could want, and something more. SUPER 8, from writer/director J.J. Abrams, who directed the 2009 STAR TREK and 2006's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III, is certainly one of those films for the summer of 2011. Abrams got a lot of help in bringing this film to fruition thanks to the generosity of his mentor Steven Spielberg; and while some will inevitably compare certain aspects of SUPER 8 to Spielberg's own directorial efforts, but the comparisons are just in the way that Abrams seems to understand that special effects alone do not a great movie make.Instead of going with a big-name cast, Abrams went with comparative unknowns, most of whom were young kids. The film is set in a small Ohio town during the summer of 1979. Several kids, including Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, are in the process of making a zombie horror flick using Super 8-millimeter Kodak film when, one night, they witness a violent train wreck that involves a truck being driven by their biology teacher (Glynn Turman). The accident is caught on camera, and they really think nothing of ituntil the Air Force mysteriously moves in to seal the accident scene. Turman warns the kids that if they tell anyone about this "incident", they and their parents may suffer some consequences too horrible to contemplate. The local police, led by Chandler, get precious little cooperation from the Air Force guys, including Noah Emmerich, and there's a good reason why. which is revealed step by step and not all at once. This is a film where a certain amount of brainpower and thought is required, even with a young cast in charge.Abrams clearly doesn't make things easy by setting this film back in 1979, nor should he. There are no Blue Tooths, Blackberrys, IPods, the Internet, or digital cameras; instead, the means of communication are traditional telephones, citizens band radios, and the titular Super 8-millimeter camera that the kids use--this, and the sight of souped up and loud Trans-Ams. Abrams does utilize several elements of his mentor's films CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and E.T., in the way things go haywire and the power goes out with the aliens' presence (the aliens remain mostly shadow figures until the climax). And as happens in E.T., the military and the law seem to be depicted in a much more sinister light than the aliens themselves (even with all the mayhem being caused), and the kids, including Fanning (who looks like a dead ringer for a grown-up Drew Barrymore), are far more sympathetic. However, he is wise not to be so overtly slavish of his mentor.The presence of such great 1979 hits as "Heart Of Glass" (by Blondie) and "My Sharona" (by the Knack) amidst Giacchino's dramatic score give us a good feel of what it was like back in those days. And while it is tempting in a film of this nature to hype up the special effects work, all of which is extremely good, the effects themselves don't swamp the movie. Even if the alien story part of the film is pretty much part-and-parcel of special effects blockbusters, it is what Abrams does with this plot that makes SUPER 8 more than just another high-budget blockbuster; it is a film worthy of comparisons to Spielberg himself.

So it is obvious that my hard 10 is a little exaggerated but I really love this film. Spoiler alert!!!The homage in this film is thick but I can't blame Abrams for loving Spielberg. I, in fact, wish had in on such a man crush after seeing this film because it knocked my socks off. There were a few continuity errors but for the obvious reason of progressing the slow moments of the story, so do not complain about the speed of the story. Yes there was a little that was not explained, okay, well a lot. But those holes in the story ask for audience involvement in the best kind of way, filling in blanks where continuity would just be a hassle. My only problem with the film is at one particular part. The part where Alice is taken by the monster and her father is trying to get out of the car. Some audio was clearly added in post production to dampen the mistake in the diologue. Alice's father is clearly screaming for "Elle" as in Elle Fanning and not screaming for "Alice" the name of Faning's character. Oops. Other than that I can only speak highly of the feeling that the movie left with me and will continue to leave with me until I personally own the film.

Unlike many recent movie trailers where the marketers think it's a fantastic idea to spoil 97.6% of a film in its trailer, SUPER 8's marketing has been really old school. The trailers have been really mysterious, relying on intrigue to get the movie goers' butts in the theater seats, which help both the cases of the film and the movie goers because SUPER 8 is one of those films where you want to see it with knowing as little information about the film as possible. The mystery is what makes viewing SUPER 8 fun and exciting. And I have to say, SUPER 8 is one of the most joyous experiences I've ever had in a theater! THIS is how you make a great summer film.Saying that, what distinguishes SUPER 8 from most summer blockbusters (or contemporary films altogether) is this: The film tells a story in which we care for the characters in it. Sure, you can have explosions exploding every minute and add as many car chases as you want, but it's nothing if the audience doesn't care for the characters trying to survive or succeed their goal by the end of the film. I mean, that's what distinguishes good films from bad films, isn't it? The film is also masterfully told by director JJ Abrams revealing bits and pieces of the mystery at a time until the third act in which all is solved. And to top it off, the film also has pitch perfect pacing. Oh, and let's not forget about Michael Giacchino's excellent score. He really doesn't disappoint us here.While watching SUPER 8, one gets the feeling of many early Steven Spielberg 1980s classics. This is no coincidence seeing that JJ Abrams wanted to make a film as a homage of all the films he loved seeing when he was a kid, which may include ET, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and STAND BY ME. And no, SUPER 8 doesn't reek of overly affection of the films that homage evolves to blatant copying. They're noticeable but subtle enough that they aren't a distraction. Abram's affection for these films also bring a sense of nostalgia ("the good ol' days") and innocence, which is enhanced by having kids be the focus of the film. There's something genuine and heartfelt about SUPER 8 that many other films don't have, and it's Abram's love for filmmaking that makes SUPER 8 feel really human.It's obvious when I say that the young actors did a terrific job in here. Every single one of them were wisely chosen, including the film's protagonist, played by Joel Courtney. Even though this is his first film, you wouldn't think that when you see SUPER 8. He's perfectly casted, providing emotional depth to his character, and he's capable of carrying the film on his shoulders. There's also Elle Fanning, the sister of the more well known Dakota Fanning, and she acts well alongside Courtney. Ryan Lee is a scene stealer, providing some of the film's biggest laughs. And yes, there are a lot of laughs in the film. Riley Griffiths is also up to the task, with SUPER 8 also being his first film. The last two kids in the group, Gabriel Basso and Zach Mills, aren't as prominent, but they're just as good as the rest of the gang. Kyle Chandler, one of the very few adult actors that has some screen time, is pretty good as well.Overall, SUPER 8 provides an ORIGINAL(!!) emotional story, great performances by the young actors, an exciting sense of adventure, and exhilarating action scenes, resulting in one of the best feelings I've had in a movie theater and one of the best films I've ever seen. Director JJ Abrams has done it again, giving people another reason why he's one of the best new directors to look out for. EVERYONE should go out and watch SUPER 8 if you like great films. Also, stay during the end credits for a great surprise. 9.5/10

I never thought I would ever give J.J. Abrams or Steven Spielberg a mediocre review so the proceeding comes as a surprise. Super 8 is like take-out Chinese food - an hour later you feel a little empty. Here's a synopsis. Alien crashes, is tortured and abused, escapes (where the movie begins) and proceeds to throw a massive bloody tantrum (with very little blood). There is also a love story or at least two good-looking young actors who put on the longing faces that should elicit a response from the audience. My wife and I are in our fifties so we are not the target audience for this movie. The girl next to us, however, was young teens/early twenties and is definitely the core demographic. She spent the entire movie texting. I hesitate to criticize the actors who seemed to be doing a good job, technically. Were J.J. and Steven trying to do a much smaller version of Cloverfield? Were they doing Stand By Me with less laughter? E.T. goes postal? I'm just not sure. If you mixed all of the above in a cuisinart and dumbed it down to a teen audience I suppose Super 8 would be the result. I think if they had concentrated on any of the above the end product would have at least been entertaining. Sigh..wait for the DVD. On the upside I read a ton of positive reviews on this site - whatta I know?

<Movie title is Prometheus>
29 May 2012
평점은 10점
I caught one of the earliest press screenings of Prometheus, which was a grand experience, as I am a complete and utter sci-fi nut. Prometheus was one of my two most anticipated movies of the year (the other being The Avengers), and there is not much doubt that it will go down as one of the, if not the, best science fiction movie of 2012.Prometheus is a bona-fide and direct prequel to the original 1979 Alien movie, giving us a portion of the story behind the space jockey; the alien pilot of the derelict spaceship that contained the alien eggs.Are the classic Giger aliens actually in this movie? No, but their precursors are. The aliens, after all, have always been evolving, taking on new shapes almost every time they incubate in a new host.Effectswise, action-wise, technically, visually and in terms of sense-of- wonder, this is exactly the movie we all hoped it would be. The whole set-up for the Weyland company is perfect and serves the first two original Alien movies (the good ones) extremely well. I would love to mention more, but it would be spoiling.The movie does have imperfections, though. Some salient points of the plot are never revealed (but left for a sequel, which, again, I hope gets made, as it will make a big difference as to how much sense this movie ends up making), and the motivation of the robot also remains enigmatic. The part I found most disappointing, however, is that there isn't much depth to the characters. The onslaught of the action doesn't leave them the necessary time to become properly human to us, and their various beliefs are not at all described in sufficient detail - although we do hear a bit about Shaw (Rapace's character). Besides her, and David, Idris Elba's captain is the best character; he is human, he has failings (yes, I count smoking as a failing!), he's a charmer, he can think and he understands sacrifice. Most of the other significant characters are scientists (finally, a sci-fi movie with more than one of those!), but, sadly they don't act like it. One is depressed and drinking for no good reason, one is just obnoxious, and one is apparently not interested in his own field of science. But, of course, they are all punished for their bad attitudes - which is something, I guess.But, I am hoping that various extra bits and bops on the disc release will rectify many of these little shortcomings, because, as it is in the movie's theatrical release, none of the characters live up to those of the first two Alien movies.It's still a great and brilliant movie, though, and one I know I will be going back to the cinema for, and get on Blu-ray as soon as it comes out, and rewatch many times. Most definitely a classic of the genre.(EDIT: The Blu-ray is out, and it has lots of extras, including some that make the salient points of the story more clear. I am very satisfied!)(EDIT II: Half a decade on, I think this movie holds up as one of the most distinctive and thought-provoking science fiction movies of the 2010s. It has so many beautifully filmed scenes, and so many amazing and mysterious ideas that I have upped my rating of it from 9 to 10 stars.)10 stars out of 10.

OK, right now I don't have clear words to describe the experience of Prometheus. But I know the truth about the experience. Prometheus is the best movie I have seen since many years. It's intelligent, no... clever and enjoyable all along. Terribly scary too. The casting is great, the story is incredible, almost biblical. In fact,Prometheus is a gift from an old director to a new generation of audience who don't know what real great cinema is. The lesson is hard but life changing. You need to see Prometheus, because it's the idea you have about movies and almost never find in it. And once you have find it, you will never want again all the junk studios give you since forever.

Just watched it in an Avant-Premiere. Great Scott, well done! For all the comparisons to Alien, Ridley was right when he said it's not the same type of story. I don't think it'll be as iconic as Alien and Aliens 30 years from now, but this movie got me thinking harder than those. The camera work was awesome, the story seemingly had a few holes in it, but since it's dealing with very mysterious subjects, who's to say if they're really holes or just something the movie didn't get around to showing us, since it packs a lot into two hours. The acting and one-liners aren't as memorable as Aliens. Regardless, it's the first time this year that I walked out of the cinema feeling like the movie was worth every penny I paid for the ticket and more.Lastly, I know Hollywood probably can't resist the money to be made in a part 2, but I really hope they do...

Having attended one of the first showings of Alien in 1979 in Los Angeles, it was with much anticipation that over 30 years later I was able to see a special early showing of Prometheus in 3D in Geneva, Switzerland.If you are a sci-fi fan, you'll love it. In sum, it's a great prequel and beautifully shot. It slots into the original Alien in a way I would have never imagined and ends with the possibility of a new spin-off to the Alien series (who makes only a minor appearance here). The opening shots of Ridley Scott's ideas of how genesis took place on earth are beautiful if not poetic. And throughout the film, you can only gasp 'wow' at the fantastic big scale special effects and nature shots. Once the film arrives on the planet and they start to explore the ruins where our 'makers' potentially come from, it pretty much keeps you on the edge of your seat (and off for a few 'jolt' scenes) for the rest of the film. The normal slimy creatures do their effect well and the standard expendable cast members meet their demise in a sufficiently nasty way. The mostly UK cast does a pretty good job but you don't seem to really connect with the characters (except oddly the robot, Michael Fassbender, who does a fine Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia type persona). At times, you feel that parts of the film have been cut out as characters make odd transitions (like Logan Marshall-Green suddenly hitting the bottle) and new characters appear out of nowhere (ah, they were on the ship too?). Charlize Theron looks good but posed and you never really warm to her. One has a sense that the film could have been another one half to an hour longer and perhaps they'll be a longer 'Directors Cut' that will help in some of the transitions and those who want to feast more on the wonderful special effects.A nerve wracking but great 2 hours and worth every penny for entertainment value.

Ridley Scott's Alien is my all time favorite movie so I've been anticipating Prometheus ever since the prequel was announced. Since I couldn't resist the wait, I saw it early this morning the day of its official release in my country.First of all, the trailers showed it, the cinematography is fantastic. Ridley Scott nailed that aspect like a genuine master. The entire movie is basically a succession of grandiose shots which surely will have other directors blush in shame. The cinematography is accompanied by great sets and fantastic special effects for which Prometheus should receive a bunch a nominations.The acting is flawless, except perhaps for a few minor characters. Special praise goes to Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron whose characters are also extremely well written and convincing. Noomi especially deserves applause for her flawless acting. There are a good number of scenes where her character is understandably very disturbed and terrified, and Noomi's acting is so genuine I wanted to scream out "just throw her a damn Oscar already!". One refreshing aspect of her character is that, contrary to what one might expect, she's not like Ripley from Alien. Ripley was from the start a pretty strong woman, close to a tomboy. Noomi's character, Elizabeth Shaw, is much more impulsive, insecure and feminine. She grows stronger as her situation becomes desperate, but she remains endearing and delicate enough that the extremely shocking things she must endure are genuinely heartbreaking.The plot for Prometheus is where I have more reservations. The attempt at making some characters seem like scientists, including Noomi's character, made me cringe at times. It's typical Hollywood scientists, by that I mean not very believable. How a teenager would imagine science-speak to be like. The build up for the climax was somewhat disappointing in comparison to the first two Alien films, and to me lacked a distinct atmosphere so essential for a horror film. The action and horror scenes were genuinely good and exciting, sometimes shocking, however I wasn't scared any time, but perhaps I've just grown insensitized to horror by now. I'll also add that if you thought the classic Alien life cycle (queen lays egg, which hatches facehugger, which plants embryo in host, which grows into a xenomorph) was a stretch, wait till you see what Prometheus has to offer, which I find makes little sense and I'll probably be wondering more about that than anything else. Obviously, the creatures in Prometheus are some forms of ancestral or primitive types which may evolve into what we know from the Alien franchise. Regardless, Prometheus offers some very pleasing surprises throughout, and it's great to discover this universe which will surely become a franchise. Ridley Scott wished it, and the end of the movie shamelessly confirms it, to the point that one could expect a "To be continued..." before the credits. Also many questions remain painfully unanswered, which is somewhat cheap.Anyway, Prometheus remains an impressive watch and paves the way to what could be a grand new mythology. It doesn't match the first two Alien films in quality, and one shouldn't expect it to or he will be sorely disappointed. I will probably go see Prometheus again, because the first time was somewhat overwhelming. I wouldn't be surprised if Prometheus is the kind of film which gets better after a few viewings. I'll add that the ending of Prometheus announces an epic sequel, probably much better, so I'm pretty hopeful for one to happen.

OK, that's perhaps a little unfair. But relatively accurate when you compare Scott's original hard nosed masterpiece to this Saturday afternoon pseudo intellectual space bonanza. It talks about man's origins and the afterlife but only manages to give us bad tempered marble men and scary squids.Fassbender's solitary scenes at the beginning are by far the film's best as his android character tends to the upkeep of the ship while the rest of the crew are in cryogenic suspension. He watches films and bleaches his hair. He perfects cycling while playing basketball and reads the dreams of his crew members. His performance (more than the writing of him) is the single redeeming element of an otherwise mediocre production.The rest of the cast are given little to do with Theron, Katie Dickie et al woefully underused. Swedish born Rapace (original Dragon Tattoo trilogy) proves once again she's got the goods but her on-screen love interest, the blandly handsome Logan Marshall Green, is totally outclassed by her and they have zero chemistry.It has some moments of decent tension and gross out horror, but where these things in the original Alien were tempered by silence and sparse naturalistic dialogue. Here the dialogue is occasionally daft, often used to smooth over poor plotting and pacing is not nearly so well judged. The result is a film that neither fully convinces as horror nor fulfills it's promise as a return to 'proper' sci-fi. For all the fanfare about this being Scott's return to the genre this more carries the signature of those who made the recent Star Trek movie and the series Lost. While no meagre qualifications, they seem odd choices for an Alien prequel and the film only confirms it.For all the visual bells and whistles, Sir Ridley has taken his own cinematic gold and sadly spun straw. Unlike Lucas, he can be forgiven for this middling attempt at a prequel but if this is a sign of things to come he'd do well to leave Blade Runner sequel-less.

This movie tries to tell a bigger story than Alien. You can say that Alien is just a small action spin off. The movie raises big questions about existence and where we come from. So on paper it sounds good but ultimately I didn't like the movie. It just left me cold. I think it was poorly executed and I didn't care about any of the characters and there wasn't much character development.This shows that just having a great idea/story doesn't make a great movie. You have to create interesting characters that make you care about them. So for me the movie ultimately fails even if it has an interesting idea.The only interesting part for me was David's motivations for his actions (played by Michael Fassbender).

Alright, I love Ridley Scott, I LOVE 'Alien' and 'Aliens', I love HR Giger and so on. So the announcement of PROMETHEUS got me more than excited.I went to see it yesterday and I was very disappointed...Visual/Sound effects and sets were all pretty spectacular as one could have expected. It kind of had a cool vibe in the beginning, but it all went downhill pretty fast.Characters aren't likable or interesting except David, played by M. Fassbender, who did a great job. Noomi Rapace was alright too I guess but all the characters where so darn shallow, it's hard to feel connected to them.This movie brings (pretty much) nothing new to the table, which is a shame. Recycling all classic ideas from previous Alien films which makes it extremely predictable. Everything feels rushed, especially after the first 60 minutes.I guess many people will enjoy this, but I was hoping for so much more.

Prometheus is THE summer blockbuster that everyone should be flocking to see in the next week. This film holds such an original idea and marvellous visuals (3D is amazing) that you would be an absolute FOOL not to watch this in the cinema. Even the darker scenes are beautiful in 3D(compared to the horrible 3D in Avengers) This film should not just be watched by sci-fi fans, but also the typical moviegoer, as it provides on of the best 3D visuals I have ever seen, rivalling Avatar. Performances are Oscar worthy, especially the fresh take of an android by Michael Fassbender. He portrays a sense of humour that would have typically not have existed in this type of film. Although this movie was conceived by a scene in Alien, you do not need to watch that film to fully appreciate this film. This film caters for everyone, to the sci-fi nerds, the horror enthusiast, and the action fans out there. I can't stress enough how this film is for everyone.Im trying not to spoil this film for you, so all I will say is that this film is a must see, forget watching MIB3 or Dictator or any other film, this is the one of the best films of the decade. Its originality surpasses Avengers, its visuals goes 'pound for pound' against Avatar, and its performances by the cast rival The Dark Knight. Simply put: it is brutally beautiful.

I saw the movie some 7 hours ago in 3D. Where to begin? The 3D seemed remarkably natural, not forced onto the picture, and that was a real delight. I went to a topnotch theater in Paris, yet ghosting was present all the time. It did distract me often, but I adapted to it. The film is well-done, extremely well-acted by most but the script is a major letdown, and so are, to a lesser degree the sets. i'll focus on the script. First, there is essentially nothing new in it, and the whole feels like pieces of Alien, Star Wars, Star Trek, you name it sewn together simply to earn some extra bucks. Second, and perhaps worse than the rest, the movie is based, not on an extrapolation of what we now know about the appearance of species, but on an assumption which essentially brings us back to pre-Darwin days. The film is thus not science-fiction, but obscurantism-fiction. The writers try to confront the issue head-on, but it does not help much. There are other liberties taken with current scientific knowledge, but I could live with them, were the basic assumption not so blatantly stupid. So, what are we left with? With a decent escapist movie, but certainly not with a masterpiece, by far. It's not even scary, there's only gore, not terror. Main culprit is the script, but who is more guilty, the guy who writes a bad script, or the director who directs it? I can understand Ridley's desire to revisit sci-fi and the alien franchise, but that was not the right way to do it. He had better left Alien stand alone as his seminal entry in the franchise.As you may know, there are talks of a sequel to this prequel, and the ending will only confirm these talks are probably well founded.

I just saw Prometheus during the premier in Luxembourg. The theater was full of course, everybody was excited.After the film was finished, I could hear the people around me being a bit disappointed. The reason is obvious to me. The film is well done in nearly all aspects, but the major disappointment comes from the fact that it often is illogical. The whole crew behaves like beginners without any deeper sense for the situation. I understand that they need to get action going, and some people need to make mistakes so something can happen. But the whole crew is just stupid. The movie plays on a level of a 1980 carpenter vampire movie. Don't ask for logic, or why has this been done in the way it was. The movie is not as deep, as Scott announced it to be. Can't remember how he said it, but it was among the lines "It's everything about everything". No it is actually very comparable to an Alien movie. You can clearly see they dug up the same tension making scenes and face huggers scare jumps etc.. It's also a bit over the top, without real story telling reason (like Alien 3 or especially 4). I have to admit that you get to know more a about the universe than in the Alien movies. But that's just a side effect.The movie is good, if you expect something like Alien (easy entertainment without too much thinking). But if you go there because you want to know more about the universe etc (like promised), it is going to be a disappointment. This movie positions itself right in the middle of "Ghosts of Mars" and "Space Odyssey"

...beware. If you enjoyed "Alien" and "Aliens" and have very high expectations as I did, you will be disappointed. Not by the visuals, extremely good, and the acting, good IMO, but by the script. In a way, I feel I fell in a marketing trap.This film was marketed as an Alien film, in this way : "A separate story that precedes the story of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise."Not directly connects ? The Weyland corp. is there. The ship the crew of the Nostromo finds in "Alien" is there. The "space jockey" is there. The usual robot passenger is there. And finally, the Alien monster is there. With the story of Prometheus, I don't see those elements interesting to use, besides an easy marketing.The script hadn't me asking questions about the story, but rather about its cohesion.One example - Weyland and his daughter come on the planet to get answers about humanity, and eventually find eternal life, and have created the robot (David) to work for them. Yet when Weyland dies and says "There was nothing", the robot says "I know".Another example, arrived on the planet, David seems to know what the Aliens are, and wants to bring one back on Earth. If in "Alien" the robot was on a secret mission for Weyland corp. to bring one back as a biological weapon, here it is the same, excepted that it obviously wouldn't be the Weyland corp behind it. Besides others humans sending David for this mission, it could be the "Engineers" themselves, or Aliens, or of course, even something else ? Which would for me make lame "explanations".Of course these plot "holes" are most likely "secrets" that will be answered in the next installment, because there will be one : it's unfortunately the law of marketing. Anyway, I won't be in the theater to hear them.

Well I was just in the theater and watched Prometheus.As an avid Aliens fan, I know all the movies, and have read most of the books out there. But I also read the interview with Ridley Scott, saying that this was not an Alien movie. So I went in, not expecting any aliens, but a good story.And the story was good. It explained a lot of the story before the alien movie, and answered a lot of my questions.I don't know if Ridley Scott have read a lot of the aliens novels out there, but it seemed he had the same ideas as to what has been written about the "Space jockeys". I really liked that, intentional or not.Most of the characters, were unfortunately very shallow, lacking depth. Too many introduced, and no real focus on them. Pure stereo types of some sort.Fassbender did really well though as David, the android.The visuals were amazing, nice and crisp. Good looking and well worth watching in the theater. The 3D part though, while great looking, was too few and far between to be really necessary to watch in 3D.Again, as an avid Aliens fan, I will only rate this a solid 7. Where the original Alien is a 9 and Aliens is 10 in pure awesomeness.But unless you are an alien or sci-fi fan, i would not recommend it for ordinary watching. It will leave you with too many questions, and too many things not understood.Especially as some of the characters, are seen in more detail on the internet commercials and TED talks. If you haven't watched them, you will not get their points and meaning.

Well, Im one of those that has the opinion that the original Alien was far the best (having watched a lot of those debates were people were arguing about Alien vs Aliens). I loved the atmosphere, characters and the tense that built up throughout the movie. It was really really superb. After having watched Prometheus I became some kind of frustrated, how can something that is made so beautiful leave you with so little thrill? Yes Prometheus is incredibly beautiful, Im really amazed on that part. But sadly, that was the only thing that amazed me in a positive way. The characters in this movie are completely non-interesting, David with a few exceptions now and then. And even then David joins the rest of the crew on the train that in my world is called "non realistic characters". Sadly Prometheus are filled with characters that you get to know so little about that you don't care for them at all. The actions of the characters often makes very little sense. In that way I didn't find them believing. Thats one big minus for the movie in my opinion. Another thing I didn't find in the movie, was some tense scenes that could put me to the edge of my seat. I hate to admit it, but even Alien Resurrection had that. But that was also a thing Prometheus did not deliver.So watch this movie for the art of the cinematography. Sir Ridley Scott has stated that Prometheus is not an Alien movie. He's right about that, it's not!

Just saw the movie in Geneva. A real disaster. I expected something that would surpass the other Alien movies specifically Scott's first masterpiece. Story is incoherent with dropouts that would be answered in a sequel. Photography and special effects are good but 3d is a failure as most of the movie is in 3 colors gray white and black. There are many clichés borrowed from the other alien movies to make the viewer more comfortable. But getting lost in the story from the first scene, reason for the creation of humanity and science versus religion theme, till the last,is inevitable.I got the feeling that its write as you shoot movie. Acting is good; Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender did a great job. They could save the day.

There is not a review bad enough to prevent someone from seeing a Ridley Scott film, nor should there be, because one does have to see with his own eyes to believe just how bad this one is.The major flaw is undoubtedly the story itself, or the lack thereof. The absence of structure leaves the impression that no choices were made, not only in the writing phase, but in the editing room as well. While certain scenes seem redundant, some unconvincing, there are those that are downright ridiculous. There is no suspense, save for a few weak attempts to hide the obvious. The sense of gradual progress is missing and any interest that may have been sparked by the opening sequence swiftly wears off. The lack of character development does not help either. One-dimensional characters do not provoke any emotion. Even the protagonists do not stand out, despite the attempt to bring back, or rather chronologically speaking, pave way for Sgt. Ripley in Dr. Shaw.Dialogues are weak. Even the most benevolent audience could not but laugh at lines that were not meant to be funny. And this was as a benevolent an audience as it gets, given the fact that everyone had waited for months for this film to come out and cued for at least two hours to buy a ticket.The film was promoted as the latest achievement of the director of Alien and Gladiator. The Kingdom of Heaven was conveniently forgotten and this film would share the same fate on the posters promoting the director's future efforts if it were only up to the artistic criteria. However, box-office will most likely determine whether a new franchise will be made based on the open ending.Had it been someone else's film it would have deserved four stars, owing to the strong, good and solid points mentioned in the title, however, as it heavily milked the allure of the Alien mythology and the director's reputation, one star is all it gets.

OK this is a lame title for a review, but prometheus kind of deserves a lame intro. The move opens up very promising, with epic landscapes and a beautifully done intro and epilogue. Then there's a scene where we see David doing his every day chores and keeping himself busy while the rest of the crew is still in cryo-sleep. This scene is utterly genius and should'v really set the tone for the rest of the movie, but all what comes after is really disappointing. the films builds up quite nice, but until half of the movie it slips away in to unnecessary dialogs. probably to cover up the major plot holes. I was sitting in the theater just asking myself: why are they doing that? Why is this character stereotype in the movie? How did they find this place so fast? Why in the hell do they have a switchboard that turns on holograms about what happened last time and who put them there? What is up with the zombie??? and so on.If all these questions were compensated with raw action, or tongue in cheek humor, i could have just waved it away; But the film propagates itself as an intellectual, epic adventure about the beginning of mankind.For a guy who made brilliant films such as Alien, Bladerunner, Gladiator etc. You have to wonder, why is he satisfied with a lame sci fi movie that any other director could have made...and i hear he's planning a sequel to blade runner... Please, will somebody tell him he has to stop before he destroys his name as a brilliant director...

Hi everybody,I went to see this movie with very high hopes, since i was very eager to see the prequel to my second favorite Sci-Fi franchise. My main hope was that this movie would re-ignite this awesome franchise which AVP (in my opinion) destroyed. Most things fulfilled my hopes, some minor ones did not... . The minor flaws iam talking about were mainly details that didn't made much sense, well... at least for people who've seen all the movies several times and know every detail there is to know about the Alien universe, otherwise these details would just pass the untrained eye without ever getting noticed.Some of the major "+ points" for this movie were, e.g: - The acting that was very convincing at times and made it very easy for you to empathize with the characters. - The photography and cinematography were exactly what you would expect from a Ridley Scott movie, with very huge scenery, a set and costumes with very high detail and beautiful shots with great camera angles. - Good story build-up, by which i mean that you won't get dropped into the action immediately, but that time has been made to tell the story properly and build up the suspense towards the climax of the movie. - Very good special effects, some of the better work since Avatar, definitely worth seeing in 3D since it's filmed in 3D and not converted. - And lastly, a good "scaring" factor that keeps you hooked to your seat, although "horror" might not be the correct way to describe it.Some of the flaws that i noticed in the details were mainly with the ship and its interior that you see in Alien (which ain't a spoiler, you can clearly see it in each trailer) and the life-cycle of the alien, because something about the cycle doesn't make sense to me, but you will notice it too when you go see the movie. Why does this bother me? because Ridley Scott made the first Alien movie himself, so i wonder why he overlooked those details.Overall this movie did meet most of my expectations and iam sure that a sequel or even a trilogy might become the result of the open ending in this movie. However, i don't know what there is left to tell since the ending pretty much refers to the beginning of the first Alien movie.

this movie disappoints me somehow, i would forgive it if it is the prequel for the next one. the movie tries too hard to impress the viewers by creating various ETs and various ways of dying, but besides this, nothing!!!in order to create a monster and also eliminate a role, the robot (Michael) poisoned a scientist for no reason. as to the characters, why bother spending the money to include Charlize for this small and so unimportant role???(who finally died in a funny way)anyway, i would say it is so so for a blockbuster and sic-fi movie of the year.

Unlike most people i had no high expectations for the film, i am not a great fan of the first Alien movie, lots of howlers and scenes that did not make sense. The same goes here, people do stupid things to move the plot along and there are at least two maybe three completely pointless plot devices that do not add to the story or characters. Basically what you get is a great deal of walking around enormous and impressive sets and scenery, the film is a treat to look at, although Scott does nothing with the 3D potential it could have been much better. The plot is very thin with not much going on, and as for any serious philosophical theme there is none. After the first hour or so, you just want the film to finish, as really very little happens, there is an action sequence triggered off by a really bad plot device where a character assumed dead returns and is let onto the ship, by a very stupid captain. there are quite a few scenes reminiscence of Alien but not as effective. all in all a pretty underwhelming experience. Good to look at and a good music score which is why i give it a six

As an alien fan I had expected a little lore along with an action packed space horror! But all i got was a bunch of new questions! The first sceen was that showing how humans were created by mistake? What happened to the guy who got "kissed" by a baby alien in the "chamber with the big head?". Why the hell did the other guy become a zombie? Why was the android so completely reckless? Why did Noomi Rapasche put on such a fake accent and what was her purpose of going to the "old-alien planet" with a ship full of aliens? What will happen to the alien stuck on the planet they were at? Was it a warning, an omen or an invitation to go to that planet?Overall the movie gets a seven because I was well entertained and it was beautifully done!

The stunning visuals that open this film and the success of the 3D gave me hope this was going to be a great film. Until about half way through I had that hope, it was building, there was a chance it would be good. However, it completely failed to deliver on every front. The characters (other than Michael Fassbender's excellent performance) were limited, cliché's that have been seen time and time before. I simply felt no sympathy for them at any point. The plot was basically non-existent and there was no tension to resolve. To say this film is a massive let down on the build up would be an understatement.Great cinematography and effects but the rest was just pulp for the brain with none of the intriguing dynamics of early Scott sci-fi.

Prometheus was always going to be a double-edged sword: on the one hand, you have Ridley Scott returning to the genre (and the franchise) that made his name, and pre-release info - be it trailers or the riveting viral videos hinting at important plot elements - suggested it would be a most welcome return; on the other, the Alien franchise has had a rather difficult life for the best part of two decades, due mainly to the disappointing Alien: Resurrection, which, ironically, killed the official series, and the mediocre Alien vs. Predator films, which tarnished the brand's legacy in much worse ways. In other words, this prequel (which isn't really a prequel) has a tough job to pull off.After a spellbinding prologue, we find ourselves in the year 2093, on the scientific exploration spacecraft Prometheus. The ship is headed to a planetoid called LV-233, based on findings by archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), who believe the human race was created by an alien species they refer to as Engineers (i.e. the creature Alien fans call the Space Jockey). With funding provided by the presumed dead Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the expedition's goal is to find evidence of the existence of the Engineers. However, problems arise on two fronts: given the Weyland Corporation's involvement, company representative Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and android David (Michael Fassbender) may have a hidden agenda; and the Engineers might not be as peaceful as expected.Originally conceived as a straightforward prequel to Alien, the script of Prometheus was subsequently reworked into a standalone effort that remains set in the same universe. This is the film's smartest idea, as it ditches the usual prequel shortcomings (namely knowing exactly how it's going to end) and establishes its own identity, whilst retaining references to the larger franchise, and Scott's original contribution in particular. It is also, however, the movie's biggest flaw, in that the screenplay, credited to both Jon Spaihts (who wrote the first, more prequel-like draft) and Damon Lindelof (who revised the story and mythology), is an uneven affair. The general plot structure is solid, but occasional snippets of dialogue are cringe-worthy, one scene in particular is dramatically pointless and some characters are underdeveloped. Forgivable in a run-of-the-mill monster movie, perhaps, but less so in a film that downplays the horror angle - the tag-line "In space, no one can hear you scream" would feel out of place this time around - in favor of bigger ideas and themes.This isn't to say, though, that smarts and scares can't coexist. In fact, Scott, ever the talented visionary, constructs imagery that is both breathtakingly beautiful (the aforementioned prologue, which is among the finest sequences in the director's career) and quite shocking, notably a much talked-about surgery sequence that is every bit as intense (and somewhat disgusting) as one would expect from the original Alien man. Prometheus may look more polished than its predecessors, but that doesn't reduce the film's stark visual impact, which is a suitable complement to the deeper themes at play, combining leftover ideas from the established franchise (the deleterious role of corporations) with a new, bold look at the essence of human nature.Which leads to the movie's greatest achievement: the character of David. A mixture of Pinocchio and Roy Batty, childishly curious and inhumanly lethal at the same time he's a gratifyingly complex and intriguing creation, played to unsettling perfection by Fassbender, who is the standout in the cast. The other performances are a bit hit-and-miss (due to the writing), but equally deserving of mention are the most un-Ripley-like Rapace, the delightfully cold Theron and a remarkable Pearce, whose extended cameo requires him to play a man more than twice his age. In the end, though, the real star of the show is Scott, whose untarnished cinematic eye, enhanced by a clever use of 3D, ensures that the journey will be worthwhile. There are a few bumps (including a final scene that is little more than gratuitous fan-bait), but overall this is a decent rebirth for the Alien saga, laying the ground for what could be an interesting extension of the franchise.

I'm really sorry, but this a major disappointment.No, I didn't expect miracles or something close to the original Alien. I've been following Scott for 30 years - and it's clear that he has been on the decline since Gladiator and Black Hawk Down.I liked a few of his later movies like A Good Year - but most have been rather flat and uninspired.One thing I've noticed, is that he's gotten increasingly complacent with his own "point of view" in terms of historical facts and how things work in reality. It's like he has a complete disregard for plausible motivations or factual information about how things work.Case in point - there's a scene in the movie where a certain character has to have an operation performed on her body - and it involves slicing directly through the skin and muscle-tissue of her abdomen. After the procedure, she's simply "stitched together" by metal clips in like 3 seconds - and with a bit of local anesthetic, she continues to move and jump about with some moaning. Ehm, you CAN'T have any kind of normal movement with your muscle tissue completely severed - and there was absolutely no healing involved. Just one of a series of ridiculous events.The plot is entirely juvenile and cliché stuff with "profound" questions like who created us. For some reason, the beings who created us also want to kill us - and it seems to involve incredibly elaborate genetic engineering that also happened to kill most of them in their remote "lab facility". They're CLEARLY much more powerful than we are - and they could just bomb the hell out of us, or do it in a thousand simpler ways. But no, they seem to want to utilize excessively elaborate and dangerous genetic modification or infestation - that they can't even control.They also like to record recent events with some kind of holographic recorder device that is unable to render clear images, only some cool ghostly images that I bet Scott loved to play with. But they're quite flexible in how they let you play recordings of their security procedure - so you can access their systems without effort.Characters are void of personality and growth, they're REALLY stupid - and they like to freak out for no reason, and they like to stay calm and playful when there IS a reason - like when encountering a nasty looking cobra-worm - an alien - for the first time in history.Among these faceless people - we have some willing to gleefully commit suicide by ramming an alien ship, because they like their captain, and they're required to do so because he "can't fly worth a damn" - despite him being the primary pilot hired by a billionaire to do nothing but fly the ship.We have a religious scientist who concludes that she's found our creators, based on: "It's what I choose to believe".Then we have the very same religious scientist look at an alien "head" they brought back - and she notices some strange growth on it. She then spends 2 seconds thinking and concludes that this is obviously some kind of "foreign cells" (impressive deduction, I must say) - and she decides to stimulate the cells with electricity - just to see what happens. No research - no caution - no nothing.We have people who decide to open the door to their ship, seemingly with no thought process, despite having just faced complete chaos by extremely hostile alien forces - because one of their crew mates seems to be lying in front of the door. This while other crew mates have just been taken over by some kind of alien infestation.Then we have the boyfriend of said religious scientist (a douche) who decides that the air in an alien environment is safe to breathe because his device tells him it is - and he immediately removes his helmet. A classic Hollywood scientist moment, and clearly there's no need to worry about biological contaminants in a place like that.This movie is FULL of this kind of utterly implausible behavior and random decisions.It has a couple of "for effect" gore scenes - but Scott manages to include ZERO tension along with them. As a result, they're mildly disgusting - but they have no lasting effect whatsoever.The "aliens" that are a part of this movie all look like plastic - because of overly smooth and pale skin. They look like Lovecraft creatures without a much-needed paint-job.We have a horribly predictable, pointless and wasted twist involving Guy Pearce and a certain other cast member. We have an android, well-acted by Fassbender, who seems to be fully random in his decisions and motivations. Few actions made sense in any context - not to me anyway.The music was overwrought and didn't fit with the mood of the film, and it seemed like one theme being repeated endlessly. A surprise, given Scott's usual flair for good music.I think Lindelof is a complete and total hack - who only got the job because he was the "yes-man" who could match Scott's ego. This is pretty obvious in interviews - where Lindelof always manages to publicly kiss Scott's behind.1 Star for Fassbender's performance. 1 Star for the amazingly detailed visuals. 1 Star for how the above combine to form the excellent beginning.Now, it's just a matter of leaning back - musing over a thousand different people coming up with a thousand different explanations - each being the "correct" interpretation of this deep and thought-provoking masterpiece.Going by the IMDb rating, I can do nothing but stay mesmerized by how efficient it is to rely on the "Emperor's New Clothes" effect and let hype do the rest. Stay real Scott, Lindelof and Hollywood.

What can I add to all the other reviews here next to mine?I'll just sum the goods and bads:+Good use of the 3D, where the holograms and dust float in front and behind characters, coupled with a solid and beautiful design. the camera is steady, with a clean picture. +Outstanding performance from Fassbender who steals the movie. He got the little changing expressions that makes you believe. Theron and Rapace are interesting in their roles and sometime give good plays. +Sound and music transports you. +new approach for explaining the Alien and the origins (see below) +Ridley just re-appropriating his own product and-just transcend all the alien franchise's mythology by taking a new kind of opposite angle -A lot of characters lack depth. - I still question some of the Hollywood necessary influence in some part of practicality in some places (the volume inside the ship, uses of light inside the helmet, some texts, ideas) -a certain turning plot that is questionable and just lack the appropriate response. -Science level equals a 12 year old kid's knowledge.***Attention Spoilers!***This is my explanation for the evolution of the Alien:The black liquid is a weapon of mass destruction that destroys a subject (black marks, cells explodes) but can recreate afterward a new species depending on the host. This means that the Alien we are used to know (2 arms, 2 legs, etc)exists only because the black liquid has infected a Human DNA. If the black liquid infects a worm, the "alien" would be some kind of worm. If it infects some furry ball animal, the "alien" would be some hairy furry alien...?! ***End of Spoiler***

When I first heard of this movie some six months ago, I was really excited. I'm not a die-hard fan of the Alien series, but I figured anything inspired by its universe directed by Ridley Scott has the potential of a masterpiece.In Alien, there was a lot of attention to aesthetics, and Prometheus takes this trend to a whole new level: from the first frames, the viewer embarks on a journey of dazzling visuals. 3D is used very well throughout the movie and enhances the viewing experience beautifully. The aesthetics are a major contributor to the mood of the film, but the soul of it lies in Ridley's masterful storytelling. From beginning to end, the film will have you on the edge of your seat as you sink deeper and deeper into the depths of the nightmare, with a couple of negligible dents in an otherwise perfectly paced picture. The cast all deliver a great performance, most notably Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender.Discussing the plot is especially difficult for this film, so I will have to be a bit brief and very vague. The plot is epic in scope, but suffers from a few inconsistencies, or loose ends. Fortunately, these are minor elements that don't divert the core storyline and don't take much away from the viewing experience, but they do leave you with a slight feeling that the movie was a bit under polished. I feel like Scott bit off a bit more than he could chew (the "all about everything" quote comes to mind), trying to mix too many elements together, but I still think that he did a good job pulling them together and making it work somehow. All in all, a very satisfying movie, just shy of being a masterpiece, but definitely worth the attention it is getting.

Much like the series "Lost", Damon Lindelof started out with a great storyline but was unable to conclude. The idea was good, but the execution was poor! Again like "Lost" it left you with more questions than answers, and the ending doesn't exactly suggest they will be making a sequel, so you're left wandering what the whole movie was about. Visual effects wise the movie was excellent, and the actors did a great job, but their was a clear lack of depth in the characters. Over- hyped movie and like Star Wars episode 1 it leaves you feeling a little disappointed. I would recommend waiting for it to come out on DVD rather than go watch it in the cinema.

This is the one that made me join IMDb just to caution other fans not to be downed by non fan cynicism. Do yourself a favor and avoid too much before knowledge. I saw it at a sneak peek on the 30th in Denmark and WOW. I had no problem following the story and using my imagination without getting it all on a silver platter. maybe being a lifelong fan i tend to make excuses but there is nothing too jarring in this new chapter. Nothing is perfect and to please all is impossible. with that in mind enjoy the brilliant 3D and a more than usual storytelling that actually made me think about the Weyland/Alien universe anew. Thank you Ridley Scott.

... do not go see Prometheus. The storyline is pretty much a joke, the character development is very shallow, the action sequences are highly predictable, and the list goes on. What we kept thinking all through the movie was: what was on Ridley Scott's mind when he agreed to do this? Is he really getting too old to make a Good Movie? I'm not much of a writer, but frankly: even I could have come up with a better script. Take Alien, mix it with any dumb action movie made in the past 10 years, throw in some faux Kubrick, served by good to great actors in bad roles and you get Prometheus. Thankfully we still have Alien, which remains one of the best movies ever made. Unfortunately, Prometheus is to Alien what a Happy Meal is to an exquisite dinner at a three star restaurant.

I was very excited to finally see this movie that I've been following since the first announcement of it's production, almost 2 years ago. Being a big fan of Alien (Ridley Scott), Aliens (James Cameron) and the art/ decoration designs from HR. Giger, Prometheus gave me the nostalgic chills on some parts of the movie that made me feel like I was watching the original Alien film and that's a good thing. The bad thing for some BUT not for everyone, however, is that you'll leave the theater with a stomach full of unsolved questions (typical a Ridley Scott thing, remember Blade Runner) and a film that needed more like 180 minutes instead of 120. It feels in a way that it was made in a rush.The theme of the story, is an exciting one and surpasses almost any sci-fi flicks from Spielberg, George Lucas and other directors and writers. Not the regular war between humans and aliens... Searching after the origins of the human being. I think that's a great story to think about.Prometheus starts off with some beautiful camera footage of landscapes on earth and arrives to a scene that explains the beginning of the human being, how it all started, at least that's what I think the writers wanted to make us believe. But there are no further explanations that confirms if the viewer is either right or wrong and it's something that happens quite often over the whole experience. This can be enjoyable for some and less enjoyable for others.Some questions remain unanswered like,Why did David his "own" experiment or his own science on Holloway was he more intelligent then we think? Was it his experiment or had he received instructions from someone beyond Peter Weyland? Had David tears in his eyes at a certain point in the movie? Did he had emotions?What's the relation between Vickers and David? Vickers, robot or not? If she was a robot, is she really dead/ destroyed? At a certain point we saw the giants (as holograms) run for their lives, from what? What happened? The giants created life on earth but why were they at war with the humans? The alien that was removed out of Shaw's body, was it destroyed after wards or did it grow into the big octopus that kills the giant (where a new species of Alien comes out of its stomach) at the end of the movie? What the hell happened with Fifield? How come he turned into a monster with enormous powers? If Holloway wasn't killed by the flamethrower, would he've been turned into the same monster as Fifield?The biggest flaw of the movie is when Shaw gives an order to the captain (Janek) to destroy the giant's ship and where Janek decides to kill the rest of the crew with Prometheus in less than 30 seconds. "Oops, there goes the trillion dollars investment and 2 friends of mine."Another flaw, the story behind each character.What I liked, the whole setting, the environment, the atmosphere of the outer space and the planet, the death of space, HR Giger, the theme and main plan for the story. The climate of the planet, the storm, was very exciting and very original.Some things that made the film a little retarded and could've been hold behind, the flute that was used in the giant's ship and Janek's accordion were totally unnecessary. The soundtrack wasn't that great either. How come they got better high tech equipment than in Alien? Ridley Scott delivers a could've been classic film but I'm hungry for more and I really hope for more. And please Mr. Scott, take your time for the sequel! We need some information about lots of stuff!8,5/10

As a big fan of the very first "Alien" movie, the third and fourth installment brought me nothing but disappointment, regardless of Sigourney Weaver's efforts to revive the one and only Ripley. "Prometheus", as it should be, is a prequel to everything I always wish I could further understand: the birth of the acid bleeding monster we so much love. It's a big production that leaves nothing to be desired, from the hands of our beloved Ridley Scott. If too soon to become a classic, it should not take long to belong in that category, making me believe that, if "Alien" was ever destined to be a trilogy, this is it. It doesn't really start with the first movie, but actually with this one. It's sleek, subtle and most of all, has the special touch of a great director who understands his craft and the passion for the story. It's great not only for the fans, but for everyone who fell in love with the franchise a long time ago. Now it's time to experience it all over again.

Prometheus is the kind of movie where a few shallow characters change from persona to fit what one could pompously call the "plot". The typical bad case of going from aggressive hard ass to puny little girl (with pig tails) (or the other way around).It's the kind of movie where they try to scare you with a noise and something jumping somewhere ... but you expected it for a while (if you didn't fall asleep already, that is)It's the kind of movie where nothing surprise you except the sheer stupidity of the characters. You can almost see what goes into the writer's head : "okay, I want 'this' to happen, so this pawn and that pawn have to do that". And who cares about coherence ?It's the kind of movie where something physically impossible (random non-movie related example: a crippled boy that would make a 10 meter jump because else ... well ... the few previous scenes are making even less sense than they already are)It's the kind of movie I would I had never lost about two (very long) hours to.Actually : it's the kind of movie that didn't deserved to be filmed.Why 3 points then ? The renderings and effects are pretty nice.Another hint about its worth: the comment in the theater at the end were all in the range of "bad, stupid or ridiculous" in English, French and Dutch.You have been warned : avoid it.

(31/05/2012, Antwerp)Yesterday evening had finally come. There I sat in the best seat of the theatre, the air teeming with the smell of hyped anticipation and slight nervosity. There was a healthy amount of Belgians and Dutch people present in Kinepolis Antwerp, but I wouldn't say the theatre was chock-full.With 3D glasses on (for the first time) I was in anticipation of awesomeness. The first thing I noticed, while watching a cool trailer for The Hobbit, was that I found the 3D absolutely awful. Luckily it wasn't bad at all during Prometheus, which did a very good job as far as the 3D goes. Anyways, I will not be watching movies in 3D again, as I still find it incredibly gimmicky.Okay, on to the real deal. Prometheus.You'd think a search for the origin of mankind would be full of danger, conflict, excitement, wonder and probably a little bit of terror as well. Prometheus shows us it's primarily quite boring.Even people who have never before written a novel or screenplay know the necessity of tension and release, of carefully paced out highs and lows, of a gradual build-up towards a climax. Prometheus proves us even well-paid professionals can be quite oblivious to these basic writing rules and that they can be happy about a story as flat as sweet Noomi's bosom, even though it looks stunning on the whole.I can only tremble at the foresight of the vast tidal waves of hate that will soon reach a certain screenwriter, but I won't add to that. I will however be very wary of any film that this person is involved with from now on, that's for certain. (In case you're still unsure who I'm talking about, it's NOT Jon Spaihts, as I know he is capable of great things.)However, even though it pains me to do so, there is someone else who I'd like to point my finger at in disappointment, someone who I know to be incredibly skilled: Sir Ridley Scott. Someone of his calibre should've recognized the weaknesses in the script and demanded they throw entire pages straight in the recycling bin. "A very interesting and fascinating take on things, boys, but please do rewrite most of act 2 and especially act 3. At once, if possible." That's what he should've said.Alas, he did not, which means he was pleased with the result. A very painful mistake, Sir Ridley.Just as troublesome is the fact he didn't deliver what he promised: "I'm looking to scare the living crap out of people." The etheric smell of rosemary and mint my boxer shorts are still spreading upon inspection (as always) is proof of the contrary. For an evening of intense terror I'd recommend watching another film (Alien would be a great place to start if you haven't seen it). Even the (minimal) work of H.R. Giger couldn't get me into the state of anxiety I longed for. By the way, it doesn't take long to realize the monster design in Prometheus did NOT spring from Giger's sinister brain, that's for certain.If Ridley truly lost it, then I'm afraid I'd rather not see a sequel to Blade Runner.Okay, all this would almost make me forget all the good things about Prometheus. The cinematography and special fx were absolutely breath-taking (we CAN thank Ridley for the former), the music was really fitting and well-placed during editing (even though it isn't particularly memorable), the acting by primarily Noomi Rapace (I still love you <3) and Michael Fassbender was excellent, and the set design was hot. Yes, hot.To conclude: + cinematography (also excellent 3D when compared to the trailers before the film) + effects + sound + acting (Rapace, Fassbender) + set design - script is ridiculously flat, very underwhelming "climax" (if you can call it that) - story tries to be deep, but it really isn't - most characters feel like nothing but cannon fodder, one-dimensional - little emotion - monster designOthers did kind of like the film however, so I recommend forming your own opinion. But be warned. I also want to point out I had high expectations, like most of us. But it pains me to tell you I was wrong. We were so wrong.6/10PS: Noomi, thanks for the mint and rosemary. <3 x

Deep, tense and visually stunning.I've just seen this movie twice, two days in a row, and I enjoyed it as much the second time... Make yourself a favor and go watch it !I loved the "Alien" franchise movies, but be warned that this film is a totally different kind of animal : it's a much more ambitious story about mankind of the scope of "2001", but enhanced with DNA bits of "Alien" and "Blade Runner" to spice it and the blend works !The 3D is very well used, in fact it's the first time since "Avatar" that I find it worth it.some important questions stay unanswered at the end of the movie so I deeply hope there will be a sequel, overall this looks to be more like the entrance door to a new fascinating franchise rather than just the "Alien" prequel that the rumor mill announced.

Both Dariusz Wolski and Arthur Max are underrated. Both masters of their craft, both outstanding visionaries and their talents collide here guided by great Ridley Scott. Visuals are always stunning and 3D is used as a powerful tool to underline the mesmerizing sets. The critics as often have no idea what this movie is really about. They keep blathering about lack of philosophy (what philosophy?). Make no mistakes, this is pure Alien franchise (read the header). I really don't get how can anyone, let alone movie critic can miss this. That is why Scott succeeds here, he reprises the perfect combination, which he has pioneered many years ago of Sci-Fi and Horror genre. What philosophy? The summer has just started, you movie critics. This movie is closer to ALIEN than ALIENS ever was. Ridley Scott's direction here should be taught in film-making text books. It starts off as an adventure, progresses into the thriller and ends up a hard-core gore monster horror, all the three inside the science fiction genre. Never it is an action movie, like ALIEN and unlike ALIENS. Never it is boring or outdated. Some scenes are if not revolutionary then unique in their technique of execution as well as their dramatic impact. During the birthgiving scene, I actually was dangerously close to fainting. Basically, if you prefer ALIENS over ALIEN, then I got nothing to say to you, but if you don't, then you are in for a ride you will never forget. What philosophy?

I didn't do my research properly before watching this movie in the cinema. I saw the trailer and thought it looked promising. I did not know it was a sequel to the Alien movies, and had i known i probably wouldn't have seen it. (I don't think the trailer made that clear to anybody, unless they knew in advance)The story was boring(as i said, i'm not an Alien-fan), sound OK, effects not original, actors not really convincing and the "scary things" weren't scary...Maybe worth buying in three years when it's getting cheap on blue-ray/DVD...

First let me say the visuals are absolutely splendid, but apart from that, there is not too much about it . The screenwriter is the guy who did Lost and it shows.Apparently in the end of the 22 century, expeditions in unknown ( and potentially dangerous ) places are done the same way than the 16th century ones.From the guy who removes its spacesuit in the underground place, to the 2 "scientists " who freak out and decide to go back on their own to the spaceship and of course, get lost and killed in the process, lets not talk about the android who just do whatever the hell he want ( why did he choose to poison the guy , i've got no idea ), what's up with the opening sequence and the "engineer" who decides to kill himself by ingesting that substance ??? What about the dead poisoned guy who comes back to life and attack crew members ? why ?Short version, its a complete mess.It does not make any sense at all and like in Lost , you leave the theater with a bad taste in your mouth.

this film is beautifully shot, nice 3D. The plot line is okay, but the character writing is absolutely pathetic.At no point during any of the film did I feel any empathy for anyone in it. The decisions made by characters (will not spoil) are completely incomprehensible, and the last scene actually caused laughter in the cinema.Its alright, at best. But, considering the hype and expectations around the film, it is a disappointment.The atrocious use of the characters is terrible. Previous Ridley Scott films I've seen utilize characters far better than this film does.Sad, as I was looking forward to this, but nothing but disappointment and mediocrity.

Just seen the first UK showing at midnight - I've come back really impressed!I tried to keep an open mind after a skimming through some average reviews, but I was sucked into the epic detail and scope with the first few minutes.The visual environment, atmosphere and technology is oozing with quality and the 3D is mostly top notch. This has to be one of the best looking films; certainly up there or above Avatar.A couple of slightly unnecessary characters aside, this is a perfect start to the world of the Alien, and gives a believably crafted story to all the questions that needed answering.It impressed me so much more than I expected and I would recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone who has enjoyed the Alien films.I need more of this and not the drivel I mostly get to see at the cinema!9/10

Something tells me Ridley didn't intend for this film to turn out the way it has. It's a bit of a shambles, unfortunately Alien nostalgia isn't enough to save this films credentials. It could be forgiven if the film hadn't been built up the way it had. The human element was missing, the gut feeling which the audience connects too, the mystery of movies to make one feel was not present. Quite spectacular at times, a sort of the 'tree of life' meets Avatar, it certainly does not deserve another film and quite frankly Ridley would know this. Character connections are an issue, not only the connection between the actors own characters and the way they interact, but the connection with us. I'd suggest to see the film on 3D and at least get some kicks out of their hard work.Better luck next time.

This film was one of my two must-see films this year, along with The Dark Knight Rises. But having just seen Prometheus I feel I should deploy an emergency beacon to warn other humanoids about this very average film.I have a lot of problems with this film, so I'll go through the negatives in a series of bullet points.Negatives: -The story-line didn't know where the hell it was going AT ALL. This was the gravest sin of all in the film. Within 5 minutes of leaving the screening I came up with a number of scenes and set-pieces that had NO PURPOSE in pushing along the plot. Such as Guy Pearce reawakening and death, the male Doctor 'virus' and burning. The ending with the humanoid alien was pretty annoying too. When you watch a film you want to at least feel like you've got a grasp of the issues. You don't want some alien to just randomly awake and start tearing off heads.-Character development and acting I didn't feel were that great either. Wassbender I liked (if a tad random), and Raspace but everyone else was pretty uninspired I'd say. Some of the decisions they made too didn't feel legitimate. They'd make leaps all over the place, 'What? Alien tears head off your buddies? They must obviously be going to wipe out mankind (and android said a riddle about this too). Let's go back and ram the ship into the alien ship.-Ending and conclusion were awful. Guy Pearce gets awoken to get killed. Why is he in it at all then? Head ripping was all very, very random. The 'fly to the aliens home planet' ending was terrible too.Positives -It did look nice.I am disappointed by it but it still deserves a watch.

If you manage your expectations then you will be in for one of the best sci fi experiences in recent years with some killer visuals.I'm not what you call an Alien trilogy fan boy. In fact I'm not exactly even a fan. Couldn't tell you the last time I watched one of them. They've never hit home with me. From my point of view they are monster movies than anything else. If the originals were set in a research lab in the south pole it wouldn't have changed much.Prometheus is a sci-fi movie at its very core. It provokes the imagination. It will ask questions such as how where we made, why, by who, for what purpose?? The movie will take you on an enjoyable, thrilling and philosophical science fiction experience. Simply put Ridley nailed it. So much so he has simply set a new bench mark in movie experiences.The visuals of this movie are amazing. Proof if anything that when it comes to special effects and eye candy none do it better than Ridley Scott. In my opinion the best use of 3D to date. Couldn't fault the cast. Having said that its clear to me Fassbender turned in the best performance. I feel thats largely due to the uniqueness and quirks of his character vs the more straight up working professional crew. Either way he turned in the performance.Going forward I hope we see Ridley revisit the Prometheus story arc and treat us with some more outstanding science fiction cinema. If he doesn't then it would detract anything from what this film IS. My only fear is this film will draw criticism for what it ISN'T and the disappointment of the fan base for the more tried and tested formula of the Alien movies.I guess that goes both ways though. The original Alien movies weren't for me where as Prometheus was. I guess only time will tell but at the time of writing this review there is a ground swell of fans who's expectations of "an Alien" movie were not met. Happily my sci-fi journey with WOW visuals expectations were met.

Just back from the midnight showing up in Leeds and i have to say, overall, im very pleased with Prometheus.I have never seen a more beautiful piece of modern film making, and i would say that the cinematography is even better than the likes of Lord of the Rings. I even found that the 3D is very effective in immersing you in the film, it is done just as well if not better than Avatar. The 3D especially helped with the lighting in the Juggernaut, the interior 3D shots are very good. Prometheus is no doubt a treat for the eyes. Having read many reviews by other members and critics my chief concern going into the film was a lack of characterisation in some of the characters, however i think this has been blown out of proportion. We learn about the characters who matter. Shaw and David are the two strongholds to the story, and their relationships with Holloway and Vickers respectively, are crucial to the story. Other characters such as Janek, Fifield and Milburn are all well rounded character who we come to like (Idris Elba is a f**king badass in this). While other characters such as Chance and Ravel are also given sufficient screen time for the audience to understand their bond and relationship, however I would have preferred a little more time with them because when they meet their fate you don't really give too much of a damn. The rest of the crew are just canon fodder and i wouldn't expect them to be fleshed out. What i will say, and i will come back to this, is that its quite obvious the film has been slimmed down, and i feel that the majority of the slimming has cut out quite a bit of character interaction. I found the score somewhat underwhelming, however it did keep the pace of the film and the tension was high enough to be able to feel it in the cinema so i guess it served its purpose on that level. I put my disappointed down to the fact that i watched Alien recently. Story wise, i thought it was very well rounded. It did ask a lot of questions and few were answered however it is obvious that Prometheus is a 'To Be Continued' film. I don't particularly have a problem with that because the film can stand alone, its just the last minutes are there as a set up for the sequel. This is not a bad thing in my book. Although not all the answer are given, Prometheus is a sturdy story, not spectacular but doesn't indulge itself too much and come off the rails. It never loses focus and drives steadily right up until the end. As i said before a sequel is necessary to wrap up the story, and thinking back Prometheus is almost definitely written as a two parter, which i find encouraging. This means that Ridley already knows the story to part two, this means we know at least the film has direction. The true negative i have about Prometheus is the editing, or more specifically the editing choices that were made. Throughout the film it felt like we were missing out on dialogue between characters and as though scenes were missing. I think the film would have benefited greatly from cutting the last 10 minutes or so off and spreading it around the rest of the film. I found that many of the death scenes were not long or gory enough. Now im not a fan of the whole 'Saw-gore' that is around these days, however , like most adults today it takes a lot to shock or scare me. I'm not saying the film wasn't scary but if felt that death scenes should have been longer, case in point Fifields death, it just didn't have the blow that it should have. Everyone was raving about this being an R-rated by the MPAA and 15 over here, this lead me to the question watching the film, was this film actually shot as an18? I call bullshit on Rothman saying it that not one shot was cut. It is obvious many shots were cut. There's no doubt the DVD will be an 18 certificate because watching the film i had the feeling like scenes had more to give. I believe that Prometheus was cut from being an 18 (NC17) to a 15 (R), and Fox thought this would please the fans. On an ending note, never have i enjoyed a single character as much as i did tonight. I genuinely looked forward to seeing David. Fassbender puts in a scene stealing performance, however its the character i fell in love with. David's child like behaviour and thirst for knowledge and endearing. The depth that was written into David is most impressive and I have to congratulate Spaihts and Lindelof on creating this character for us. I also very much enjoyed the look and presence of the engineers. They were both human and alien at the same time. Their symmetrical faces were unnerving and they have been created into genuinely disturbing characters. I think the film did well not to tell too much about them as a race a that removes the mystery and the terror behind them (Much like Aliens- Xeno + Queen = Bug). Prometheus, for me personally is a triumph. Whilst not perfect it shows Ridley Scott is one of the greatest visual directors to grace film, i just feel lucky im around to see what he creates.

I was fortunate enough to grab seats to see Prometheus in IMAX 3D at the Metrocentre in Gateshead for the opening midnight screening last night.This is the first feature film I have seen in IMAX 3D, and I should start by saying that the 3D was actually a lot less obtrusive than in other recent releases films. It may not have added much to the experience, it didn't bother me either. From a technical aspect this is one of the best Sci-Fi films I have seen in a long time, with stunning visuals many of which were shot in stark, earthly landscapes such as Iceland and the Isle of Skye, but which both Ridley Scott and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski manage to make seem brilliantly ethereal and extraterrestrial. All other technical aspects of the film are wonderful.As far as the story, script and acting goes, most initial reviews that I have read seem incredibly divided, but I was largely impressed. I think Rapace and Fassbender were both highly commendable in their respective roles as the curious, eager scientist with a strong survival instinct and the mild-mannered, mysterious and yet unpredictable and slightly sinister android. Theron and Elba are satisfying in their roles as the icy corporate overseer and droll ship's captain, but the rest of the cast were largely forgettable as cannon fodder. While it certainly lacks the characterisation and naturalistic feel which Alien had, I believe the two films set out to achieve very different things and do them very well; Alien was a much more low-key, personal thriller which focused on character development to create tension, whereas Prometheus focuses on grandeur and spectacle to create awe and adventure. From a story point of view, there are a couple of moments which retrospectively don't make sense, but I found most of these easy to overlook at the time and they really don't bother me too much.I would also go so far as to say that Prometheus works better as a horror film than Alien did; Alien never repulsed me especially as I knew what was coming due to heavy exposure, but the horror in Prometheus, while strongly reminiscent of the subliminal themes of sex, fear of pregnancy and rape which were strongly implied in Alien (albeit shown in a more overt way in this film), was done in a fresh and surprisingly disturbing way which did repulse me, and I don't say that very often about horror films. I feel that the horror in Alien, while iconic, is not nearly as agonising as it is in Prometheus, as the characters suffer for a short period of time in Alien.Finally from a philosophical point of view, many have complained that Prometheus raises more questions than it does answer them. I think it, along with a little prior knowledge of the Alien franchise and what Scott originally intended it to be, allows the viewer to construct their own thoughts and conclusions whilst leaving a little open for debate and contemplation should another film be created. For instance, the question which keeps coming up is "why?". Well I have my own answers which I was able to make based on what I saw and what I already knew had been speculated about the origins of the Space Jokeys and the mythology of the Alien franchise in general. Furthermore, as a fan of the original Alien, I felt extremely satisfied by how they tied in a lot of the elements to the original film, and am willing to see how Scott chooses to expand on this story, as there are lot of ways it can be done.On the whole, not a film for everyone, and it will divide opinions, but I really liked it. Is it as groundbreaking as Bladerunner or Alien or any of the classic Sci-Fi epics? No, but I do think that it will be remembered as one of the best Sci-Fi films of its time, and easily as Scott's best film since Gladiator. I gave it 9/10 initially due to the sheer enormity and breathtaking beauty of the world which Scott created. Having had time to ponder some of the flaws, which are evident but did not bother me as much as in other films, I will give it 8/10 (maybe 8.5 if I'm feeling generous), but I would still highly recommend it and put it in the list of best films of 2012 (so far).

Booooorrrrrinnnnggg! Just been to see it and my advice is don't bother. First 30mins, your thinking, hey this could have the legs! Then appears a little teaser of several stories that could lead somewhere that just fizzle out into nothing. The only thing I can compare it to is a long journey in a car with no destination. You will not care who lives or dies, you will not know what is going on and where this is leading you to. Its like a bad sat nav journey. Save yourself the money yet again and just stay in and watch the first movie for the chills, the second for the action and if you have a brain in your head, the third for its feeling. When will the studions plough some money into something original and worthwhile instead of whipping yet another franchise horse to death. This franchise died along while ago and this film makes you think they are whipping its long dead corpse...hopefully for the last time.

Definitely lacks the claustrophobia of Alien and the acting and scriptwriting are not as tight. However, it must be remembered that comparing anything to the original Alien is setting a very high bar indeed.There is a plot, well plots, well probably too many plots and not all are drawn to a satisfactory conclusion. Being charitable there is a narrative arc that could be continued in sequels, or it could just be a bit sloppy in this regard, and fail to manage to quite stand alone. There are a few, 'no sane person in this situation would do that', moments, and a couple of characters who, from early in the film, are clearly only there as gore fodder. There is also a sub textual study of the risks of genetic experimentation, but that part is quite predictable. Oh! And do be sure to check-in at the cinema door, any scientific training or critical faculty you may possess ('t were ever thus!).The acting is a little patchy: at the good end Fassbender is truly excellent and basically does much of the heavy lifting through the film; Theron is suitably captivating and seriously intimidating; Rapace, to me is a bit weak, I expected a more assertive character that developed as the film progressed, as Weaver did with Ripley in Alien, but those high notes were sadly, slightly missed. Idris Elba does a nice job of playing the capable, if world-weary captain. Guy Pearce has a very small part, and doesn't get chance to build up momentum for his character. Logan Marshall-Greene does an okay job but his similarity to Tom Hardy made me think the latter would have been much better suited to this role. Other performances are passable, though not outstanding. It was good to see Benedict Wong give another good, though sadly small, performance. The sets and CGI are very good. I saw the 3D version with all of the problems that brings with it (low light levels, and some distraction caused by the 'view-master' effect). I'm intending to get back to see the 2D version soon. The use of 3D was not as gratuitous as it might have been in hands with lesser skill than Sir Ridley's but I think this film will be much better in 2D.So, does that sound negative? Well possibly BUT, compared with the other Alien sequels and spin-offs, with the possible exception of Alien3, (which I **really** like) this film is much better. The script is much less cheesy that Aliens. The plot(s) are more involving and gore scenes much less gratuitous that Resurrection and as for the AVP sub-franchise, well we don't even need to go there.So, in summary, it's an above average movie in its own right. It extends an interesting and challenging universe in an engaging, unsettling way; and I feel it did manage, to reboot the franchise. I think if you are an Alien fan, you should see it, if you enjoy suspense / horror / gore / action you'll have an enjoyable 124 minutes and if you like Ridly Scott direction and awesome scenes you will also find things to enjoy. However, as it attempts to complement one of the greatest films ever made, but only manages to stand closely by in the shadow, I am giving it a mildly disappointed 8 out of 10.

So... Prometheus... Dear Mr. Scott, please don't mess with Blade Runner. I know you're a big time director and yes you've made two really great movies 30 years ago, so you can do whatever you want. But could you, Mr. Scott, please not do a Blade Runner follow-up. It's OK if you want to do a dystopian future noir movie, just don't include any references to the great future noir movie you did all those years ago. Let's face it, 2012 marks your 30th anniversary for not making a decent film. Sure Gladiator was a box office hit, but a good movie? Not, really. But let's not dive into that here, Mr. Scott. I'm asking you not to do to Blade Runner what you've just done to Alien. Where did you put your talent? Or did the producers just want to cash in on the Alien brand, and made you put in all that trifle, clichéd, predictable nonsense to distort the fragile plot. A plot that worked in the original because it was, well... Original. Oh, that's right, I just remembered, you were also the producer... Just thought you ought to know, Mr. Scott. But maybe my expectations were too high. After watching the promo videos I was all revved up for Shakespearean, space opera. But alas I was disappointed. It follows the simple plot of Alien: a monster and a single twist with a backstabbing android. So that is just recycling. It is the amount of clichéd fill and two dimensional characters, and a few plot holes/logical errors, that bugs me. And though the wrapping is nice. The present itself just feels too sterile, soul less and half hearted. So again, please don't touch the Blade Runner universe, Mr. Scott.

Throughout the years I came to consider Alien and Blade Runner more as exceptions than as standard Ridley Scott masterpiece productions. Therefore, I did not have high expectations for Prometheus.Nevertheless, it was with some anticipation that I joined a crowded audience for the premiere of Prometheus in Brussels. I watched online the promotional "teasers" about "David" and about the fictional 2023 speech for TED, delivered by Guy Pierce (as Peter Weyland) and I was hoping for some new concepts to be developed.Turns out, those two teasers were – almost – the best part of the movie. I cannot but agree with most other reviews so far. Great photography and CGI, poor story.The movie opens with an enigmatic sequence about DNA merging, which is left unexplained. What follows is a rehash of the Alien plot. Namely: assorted crew sent for an undisclosed mission; mysterious android who might have a hidden agenda; spunky heroine; a hasty exploration leading to infiltration of alien material; dire events that cause the extinction of almost all the crew does that remind you of Alien or I am biased? Only this time there are no pets on board and I really miss the cat Jones.The distinctive qualities of Prometheus are few. The crew is supposed to explore the planet from which humankind originated, thanks to alien "Engineers". I guess this should be the great twist – looking for the creator rather then stumbling upon the destructor. Unfortunately the development and outcome are very similar to Alien, with zero depth attached to the philosophical quest.Frankly laughable, even at fictional level, the way the so-called scientists explore the alien artifacts and analyze the samples they collected. Indeed, some of the scenes cause unintentional amusement When the spaceship lands, even if the "scientists" are told there are only few hours of daylight left, they rush out like children to investigate the alien "building". Once inside, they touch everything around them, sticking their fingers everywhere. Two of them manage to get lost, even if they are carrying very sophisticated directional equipment...Worth mentioning a creepy scene of the Engineers escaping along dark corridors and the tri-dimensional space map (as mentioned, the visual part is terrific). Also the enigmatic android David. He is truly the star of the movie, and it is not a good sign when an android is the most interesting "character" of a movie. The Rapace character – "scientist" Elizabeth Shaw – is not so successful.If you saw Alien you might not be so impressed by Prometheus. Perhaps young audience will like it better, but what I start to find tiring in the Alien universe is that we still have no clue about how all this started or is going to end. And sometimes closure is really needed.

I've been for 30 years a big fan of M. Ridley Scott and of his movies. For this reason I was waiting this movie confident that it will be at least "very good". But I was wrong! Despite the quality of actors, imaging, effects and so on, the movie is very poor, without any new idea or originality, without the talent of such a great director, without what Mr Ridley Scott usually did in all his previous movies. I think that the target of this movie is purely making money taking advantage of important and well known people, starting from the director name: this is really deceiving people that have appreciated them for their genius and professionalism. An Italian disappointed RS-fan.

Watched the midnight showing last night. Slept on it.  Realised that the beginning scene is one of the space jockeys on pre life Earth.  No explanation as to why he drinks a canister of the stuff though.  Perhaps decides he's had enough.  His and the alien manufactured bio weapon DNA goes into the water and human life is eventually created.  They obviously want to destroy life on earth as humans therefore are alien bio-mechanical creatures with the evil strain of the alien stuff in the cans.  That's why man wants to destroy himself.  They've been coming back all these years to check and now we're at a point that we can travel to other planets and they don't like that.  That's what I think.  The whole movies plot line hinges on Idris Elba (who never leaves the ship) saying "It's a munitions dump far from their own planet" to vaguely explain partly what the balls is happening. Poor.  Guy Pearce has no business being in the film either. Why not use a REAL OAP?! Bad makeup and no real spark from any of the actors.  Poor script and messy plot.  Wait for the DVD.

This review contains spoilers, so please, if you've not seen this movie DON'T carry on reading.OK so I don't usually write reviews, but in this case I feel I HAVE to review this movie, perhaps mostly to vent some frustrations. Being a massive Alien(s) fan (a self confessed alien junkie who owns several copies and knows perhaps a little TOO much about it) I think this why I am so let down.Let me start by saying I have been waiting for this movie with great anticipation since the concept was revealed to the media. Then the gradual release of the various trailers just added to my excitement, especially as the trailers looked SO good, they just oozed reference's to Alien and had a wonderful creepy atmosphere to them... but that's where atmosphere stayed I guess...The film starts off well enough, beautiful scenery, beautiful 3D, and then... we are greeted by a hooded figure walking near a waterfall, who looks suspiciously like a rubber Vin Diesel, but okay, I can accept that. My curiosity and research into the movie had already told me that this guy was a Space Jockey. The film then carries on well enough with more visual treats etc and a nice part with David and his introduction into his creepiness.The film starts hitting confusion when they land on the planet they discover in a star map (one of the LV planets - presumably near to LV-426 from the original Alien) I can only presume (you'll notice I use the word 'presume' a lot - mostly because this film is riddled with plot holes and things that will leave you wondering 'why'?) that the scientists knew exactly where on the planet to land as they seem to find the 'tomb' straight away, however the film makes out they just randomly stumble upon it by accidentally flying into the right area... okay fair enough. The young scientists want to go looking straight away - brilliant we could see some action / suspense, space jockeys! Well not really, it seems to be a rather brief trip, but a least we see some space jockeys. One thing that annoys me here is the character 'Fifield' - every films likes to have a 'hard man' and quickly he is established at being just that... mo-hawk, tattoos, attitude etc but he is the first to run away when they stumble upon a dead jockey!? Fair enough he's not that hard man or the cool guy everyone likes in the movie... who is? So some things happen, things that leave me feeling very disappointed, mostly due to the space jockey concept. The helmet. The exploding face? why? and then the rest of the plot starts making no sense... David the creepy robot decides to poison someone with Alien goo, wicked, lets see him transform and kill some people or something? okay maybe he'll turn into the space jockey we see in the trailers? nope, okay lets see him commit suicide and be forever forgotten from this movie once again (one can only presume he was poisoned the impregnate Shaw - but who knows) otherwise his poisoning is pointless and his death needless.Fifields return... a chance for some action? not really, its short lived, although I did enjoy the little 'Aliens' reference in his death.Everything that happens beyond this point in the movie just adds to the confusion of it. I read the small amount of reviews on here before going to watch the movie, and I noticed a theme, a theme that I REALLY did not want to believe, but in the end the negative reviews are just right. I don't want to believe it, but they are.This film could have been so much more, and its biggest problem was moving away from being an Alien prequel and trying to be its own movie, instead it is just a mash up of different ideas which ultimate destroys my passion for the evolution of the alien. This film should have been unconnected to alien OR it should have been a direct prequel to alien. Instead we just have some kind of mash-up of ideas and some space jockeys thrown in for the fans. I idea of a space jockey being an engineer was something I liked, but I hated that they were big rubber men in suits, I would have preferred them to be a separate race of alien who created man, not aliens who are men.The End was the worst part of the film, never have I been so disappointed to see a Xenomorph (or some breed of) or how it was "born", (big squid facehuggers?) I much preferred the original concept of them being a biological weapon to destroy planets. Elements of that idea where there, but quickly forgotten.The film lacked suspense, there were no scares, and just when I thought something was being set up for a scare I was just left bored. The film has great ideas which are ultimately destroyed by it trying to be connected to Alien which in my opinion is its downfall. It is riddled with plot holes, pointless characters (Weyland and his makeup, Vickers and her star wars "father" line, and pretty much every other character besides David, Shaw and Janek).Ridley I had high hopes and you destroyed them, this film could have been amazing. Instead it fits in between Alien Resurrection and Aliens Vs Predator (I can't class it on its own since you decided to tie it to the alien saga sorry).5/10

Before I begin, I should point out that I have been waiting for another legitimate release in the 'Alien' franchise, as have my fellow fans for many, many years, sure I was disappointed in 2009 when it was announced that it would not be a 'direct prequel' but I still had a good feeling about how the film would turn out on the whole. Giger was back, Scott was back, the Space Jockeys were back, it was always a spectacular recipe for a potentially spectacular movie. As I walked into my local movie theatre, I was greeted in the lobby by one of the projectionists who spied my Wayland-Utani t-shirt and proceeded to tell me 'Ahh Prometheus. I saw it this morning. It was good, not great.' my heart sank and I began to worry. But I shouldn't have been worried because fortunately 'Prometheus' is exactly what I wanted it to be, an Alien movie, it answered some of the smaller questions , pieces of back story which had always fascinated me, but it also posed tonnes of new questions as well.The film is beautiful, it's hands down the best use of 3D I have seen to date, it doesn't get in the way, it isn't dark (when it isn't supposed to be) and it does add something to the experience. The film is very well acted on the whole, however some of the characters are lacking in depth, while the script fails slightly here, more importantly it does not make any prequel Star Wars-esque lore atrocities (assuming 'Alien Vs Predator' is non-canon) and alludes CONSTANTLY to Alien, it is subtle and you have to look carefully but it creates a wonderful sense of tension and doesn't let up for a minute, my heart was literally in my mouth as the crew of the 'Prometheus' proceeded inside the bio-mechanical 'bone-ship' and the story plays really well with the expectations of the viewer.In terms of mood I would say that it falls somewhere between 'Alien' and 'Aliens' but falling more towards 'Alien', it has dead silence, it has stillness and moments where you doubt what you are seeing, but it also has some very intense action towards the final act.I am certain that there will be some fans who will be disappointed by the lack of answers, however in my humble opinion they are slightly missing the point, 'Alien' basically told us nothing, where are they from, where were they going, why is the Derelict on LV-426? To me half of the fun of this story is not knowing every little detail, that being said there are still some wonderful nuggets of lore which the fan-base can add to the canon.Pros: The film is beautifully photographed, the soundtrack is pretty average although they did manage to sneak the theme of the original film into one scene which I thought was a nice touch. It continues to tell stories within the Alien universe and gives answers to some of the smaller questions whilst leaving a degree of ambiguity towards the end. For fans of the Alien franchise this is essential viewing, I can't stress that enough, it just might not be EVERYTHING you expected.Cons: Some of the minor characters' personalities and motivations are more or less nonexistent which is a shame because this is something which the other films in the series have done very well and it probably isn't as epic as the trailers made it out to be, although I suppose that is rather the point.

I caught the midnight premiere of Prometheus last night, and left the cinema in a state of bewildered disappointment. Sure, it was a good looking film, but everything beyond that was at least bordering on awful. I guess this is largely because of my great expectations on the film (Scott's earlier SF movies rank amongst my favourite films), but there is no escaping the fact that the script is horrible. Coming to IMDb, I was quite dumbfounded to see that it currently has an average grade of 9.0, and several reviews calling it "intelligent". Because that is exactly what this film most clearly isn't. The story is weak and frequently illogical, the characters wooden, and the action is predictable. This is a shame, because the ideas that it is based around are interesting to explore. The most grating parts are where characters essentially discuss philosophy (why are we doing this, what are we seeking, what is the difference between men and machines). I would describe it as if it was written by angsty 14-year olds, if it wasn't for the fact that I don't want to insult 14-year olds. It is ham-handed, shallow and riddled with cliché.The characters' behaviour is often highly implausible and/or erratic. Sometimes I got the feeling that there are scenes missing that would make sense of what happens, but there is enough stupidity in what's there to make me doubt it would make a difference. There is no real journey for any of them, and there is hardly personality enough among them all to match even one of the characters in the first Alien film.Speaking of the old film, it is also sad to see how much they rehash old scenes. (cryopod awakening, stomach bursting, facehugging, alien oral fixation, android physical prowess, gruff weapon guys, alien in the escape pod, etc.)The story has a lot of gaping holes. There is a lot unexplained, which could have heightened the mystery, but now only serves to provoke a "I don't buy that at all"-reaction.In all, an utter disappointment, which gets three stars for the visuals and some residue sentiment from earlier films.

Below are just a few stupid mistakes that came to mind during watching...1. Prometheus is a four-thruster exploration ship? This is nonsense. First off, four-thruster configuration is needed only on military ships, to provide utmost maneuverability. Exploration ships will be built with engine configurations optimized to reach farthest distance, using single-thruster engines.2. For a mission of such magnitude and budget the ship would surely be weaponized, so there would be no need ramming into the alien craft to bring it down.3. Not a word on how a spacecraft on four conventional thrusters managed to reach a remote world in just 2 years.? Really? Sorry, I didn't know there was yet another earth like planet in the solar system, because that's about as far as they would get in two years on conventional thrusters, or just about in the outer frontier of the solar system.4. For a mission that cost billion dollars to hire a crew of idiots... Especially the guys with red irokez, who gives out this line: Not here for your damn friendship, just to make money . I mean, come-on, is this the best that a billion dollar can buy in the near future - a skank and a mule? The mission of such magnitude is expected to have the best professionals from the earth, not some trash. A real Mr. Weyland would be ashamed to surround himself with such people.5. Prometheus appear to be using a lot of standing controls, i.e. one must stand in front of them freely, instead of being tightly strapped, like to see the captain standing at various consoles and shaking buttocks during the ship's landing looks real stupid.6. In a mission like this to start instructing people on what it is all about only after they have reached their destination? Is that a quick top-secret military op? Really? I was under impression scientific missions are normally planned a little more thoroughly, like a few years in advance...7. Just as Prometheus lands, nearly the entire jock bunch rushes into the alien caves. This one just beats them all. In reality they would acquire a complete scan of the place first, and then send android there alone, to evaluate the environment before any human attempt to go there, which would likely be a group of 2 or 3 people at most, never most of the crew as was shown. On top of it, they almost immediately remove their helmets, while an alien world could easily have undetectable to them contaminants, that's just outright stupid.8. Imagine you are on an alien world, lost in a damn dark and creepy cave, full of dead aliens and scary stuff, and suddenly a creepy alien tentacle emerges from some disgusting-looking liquid. What do you do in this case? - Crap your pants and run away for 10 minutes scared to even look back? Well, that'd be my guess. But according to the genius of Mr. Ridley, you just pretend to be an American tourist - you start taking pictures, you try to give it a hug, and even tearful, you will probably try to kiss it - for real, my first alien, yo! 9. The discovered aliens appear to be the lost cause. They synthesized some genetic mutators that they failed to control themselves - how stupid of them! That was some buggy specimen they "engineered", however, they did make it creepy as hell, so we applaud them here...10. Holograms manifest themselves almost spontaneously. It does look creepy, alright, but I think even in our underdeveloped age there is understanding that a hologram does take some equipment and energy to create, they don't just run through the rock by themselves.11. DO NOT TRY AT HOME: The girl gets herself wide-open by an operation equipment, then simply gets stapled nearly all the way across stomach, and then just walks away. The droid says - that's the spirit, I like, and we applaud - Na-a-ii-ice! And to think that I was hoping for something more intelligent...

Saw the movie yesterday in beautiful 3D. The atmosphere of the movie was absolutely splendid. It sort of felt like you were part of the movie rather than just watching it, which is a feeling I have only experienced once before (watching Fight Club that was). The religious undertone of the movie was something I on beforehand had hated, but for some reason it fitted in when I watched it. I'm not a big fan of Damon Lindelof, and when I heard that he was on board on this production I got a bad feeling in my stomach (no, no chest-burster – just thoughts and feelings over the crappy ending of Lost, with all its unanswered questions and major plot holes). My fears were somewhat answered because there are some significant plot holes and events in this movie that made me think like "how the **** does that make sense?" I had also read beforehand that John Spaiths original script had a way darker approach that D L rewrote to make it more fitting for the "Hollywood – it's all about the cash -industry".Even if the movie contained several severe plot holes and unanswered questions, I must say that I absolutely LOVED the movie an d I'm giving it a 10/10 because it was such a ride. When it comes to 3D-movies I have only watched maybe 6-7 of them, but this one far surpasses them by grand proportions when it comes to the visuals and camera-work. Most of the characters were farely stereotypical, but Michael Fassbender as the android gave an outstanding performance. Charlize Theron's Meredith Vickers was good, but way underused, as well as Idris Elbas character Janek. Some of the dialogue though thru-out the movie were so cheesy it was almost laughable – particularly between Janek and Vickers, and between Janek and some of his crewmembers.All in all the best movie I've seen this year even though it had a lot of shortcomings, which I will talk more about in the spoilers-section bellow.SPOILERS – do not read unless you've already watched the movie - SPOILERS SPOILERS – do not read unless you've already watched the movie - SPOILERS SPOILERS – do not read unless you've already watched the movie – SPOILERSFirst of – when Rafe Spall's character Willburn and Sean Harris character Fifield get lost running around in the spaceship, these two, who were the most scared of them all, goes into the most frightening room of them all where all the urns are standing and sits down in there to rest. Also, everyone hurdled back to the ship when the storm was coming because they would die from superheat and electric outbursts, but out of some miracle Willburn and Fifield stay unharmed, although they stayed behind in the ship that everyone were running away from to get to safety, so apparently the storm wasn't that harmfulI never really understood why Holloway never told Shaw that he had become infected, and I really don't understand how Shaw could take it so easy as she did after Vickers had killed of Holloway in the most brutal manner. The dialogue between Janek and Vickers when they were talking about having sex and when Janek spoke with Shaw about taking out the other ship were so cheesy I thought I would fall through my chair, not to mention when Janek told his fellow co-pilots that they were going on a suicidemission and they were like "**** yeah!!".

After all the hype it was not totally unexpected that this would be a run-of-the-mill type of film. Anyone who says this is not like Alien must have a very short memory. Take this quiz:1.

I saw this at a midnight preview and I was really looking forward to it. I'm a big fan of Alien, but I was really disappointed; this is a bloated mess.In Alien, the creature presented an abstract threat to earth but the plot centered on the immediate, physical threat to the crew. In Prometheus, the threat is purely abstract and while SOME bad stuff happens to the characters, they are all unsympathetic so it is difficult to care. Characters are established with simplistic dialog; this is the cool black guy, this is the incautious explorer, this is the obnoxious mercenary cyberpunk (who, for no reason, is also a scientist), this is the uptight corporate type.The scientists don't behave like scientists, they don't talk like scientists. The nerdy biologist (who has to walk off to be monster fodder later), walks away from an alien corpse because it's not his field of interest. Huh? Archeologists suddenly turn into medical experts and people exploring an alien ecosystem for the first time remove helmets without regard for contamination of the environment or themselves. Often, the only justification for character actions seems to be to set up later plot points.Alien worked because it focused on believable characters stuck in a terrible situation, without that believability the film would be greatly lessened. Prometheus, lacking that, is uninteresting.Prometheus puts me in mind of Avatar. The use of 3D is excellent and the art direction is amazing. However, as with Avatar, technical excellence cannot make up for a terrible plot, sub-standard characterisation and meaningless dialogue.

I'll say it straight away, the script was crap. Everything else was brilliant! The acting, 3D, music, plot etc. were all great. It lives somewhere between Alien and Aliens. With a beautiful opening, showing the "Creation" of man. The scenes involving the ampules were amazing and the "surgery" scene was an immediate classic. The ending seemed to have been slapped on and was a bit cheesy but the movie as a whole fits perfectly within the Alien universe and does not detract from the myth as it does NOT explain the LV-426 derelict, it merely explains and I say explains lightly, what those beings were and what they did for mankind. I hope that the Blu Ray release adds about 20 minutes back in so that the characters are fleshed out a bit because on leaving the cinema, the only thing I felt let down about was that the characters weren't given room to breathe. (and of course, the crap script).Don't go into the cinema with reviews in your mind, just make your own mind up.

After my first very negative review (I only gave one) and nearly one week after viewing the film I think I was wrong to be so negative. As I try to explain below.I had an open mind before going to see this film, I did not expect or associate it with Alien. I looked at it purely on its own merits.I realize now why my initial dislike of the film was based on its story. Anyone who has read Twelfth Planet (Earth Chronicles)by Zechar Sitchin would understand its not easy reading how we came about and how our creators view us. So I realize that for some people they may not like the film not because its a bad film but it does not fit comfortably with their hopes and beliefs. If this is deliberate by the script writer then it is far more clever and deeper than I realized. However the script is the biggest let down. More holes to fill a black hole. If this film had a better script it probably would have been one of the best science fiction films of all time. There are two very particular holes that made me want to hate the film and believe I had wasted 2 hours of my life and nearly £10 ($15).But the strange thing is apart from the script the film is haunting, it does create an alien world, it does create a believable Robot (Oscar worthy acting), it does create a spaceship landing on another planet, for the special effects, for the cinematography, for the Directing it is exceptional, beautiful and believable.Edit: just bought the DVD and watched it again, its worth it just to watch Michael Fassbender as the Robot, I hope he gets a supporting actor nomination in the Oscars. He deserves to win it!

This movie doesn't deserve a lot of words. Ridley Scott and Fox show their CGI mastery, but it seems that for every dramatic looking scene they gave in on storytelling. Needless to say, this movie is full of dramatic looking scenes...The problem with Prometheus is that it tries to develop too many characters too quickly, which results in the fact that viewer can't 'bond' with any character at all. This also means that the viewer doesn't really care and hence takes away a lot of the suspense. If you can't relate to a character, you don't get involved into the story.Prometheus looked promising, but even with all the wonderful CGI, left me disappointed and even bored at times.

This was full of special effects; thats the best thing I can say about it. From the start there was no cohesion to this film; big enough holes in the plot to put a spaceship through. Scott managed to wipe out the entire theory of evolution in one small diagram! It followed nothing of the original Alien and was just awful. The acting was terrible, was does a Brit actor suddenly call a vase a vAse... cant Americans understand nonUSA words?? How do you get liquid all over your body but your hair stays bone dry from Hypersleep? When did giant beings with black eyes manage to have exact DNA as humanbeans when thats not physically possible? Last time I looked at an operation you needed to have your fascia and muscles sewn back together prior to skin stapling. Why is the original Alien a type of squid? What were the worms things that came from the vAse? I came out of the cinema in total bemused silence, then I got angry, how dare RS take such a loved and iconic film and ruin it! a touch of the George Lucas I think.... has really put me off ever seeing anything by him again, not to mention the stupid actors for joining in!! have none of them or all the others involved in film making SEEN the original??

Let me just start out by saying i was totally hyped for Prometheus, i followed all the fan boards read all the spoilers watched all the featurettes, everything. I was obsessed. I wanted a new sci fi horror that was going to rock my world. What we got was very different..... but thats not a bad thing by any means.Prometheus is not really like Alien or Aliens for that matter, it downplays the horror angle and goes for a more sci fi adventure approach, There are scenes of horror and gruesome goings on but thats not what its about. Its grander much more grandiose than any other entry into the saga before it.Lets put it simpler. I went in wanting balls to the wall sci fi horror, what i ended up seeing was something else, but a great ride nonetheless. Don't listen to the bad reviews and the naysayers, go get immersed in one of the most visually stunning and exciting sci fi movies in a long time. By the way don't be expecting to get all the answers about the space jockey on LV - 426 or you will be left short changed.Overall its very different to what i went in expecting, but its great non the less, visually stunning, great cast and lots of great action set pieces. 8/10. Cant wait to pick up the Blu Ray.

There's no point crying over spilt milk and, after the Alien vs Predator outings, you could be forgiven for thinking that there wouldn't be another good movie in either series. With Ridley Scott at the helm Prometheus seemed like the perfect chance; and even with trailer upon revealing trailer you held out hope for the movie.And, for the first two thirds, you were right to.We can skip across performances quickly. Everyone is good, even when the script isn't perfect, but worthy of mention is Fassbender's awesome and creepily logical David, Theron's Vickers and Elba's, long in the tooth, Captain Janek. Rapace is good too, but she is so much in the mould of Ripley she doesn't stand out. If there's one complaint there are too many characters to keep up with and so fine banter is often lost, as the viewer is trying to catch up on each members motivations.Music is oddly upbeat at times, but occasionally harks back to the series that spawned it. Direction and camera work is what you would expect from Scott and his team; simply stunning and often beautiful, even at the moments of true horror. There are even subtle nods to his own original, as well as the sequels (not the AvP Movies).Where Prometheus is let down is with story and editing. Both of these sit reasonably well for the start and middle section of the movie, as long as you accept that none of these scientists have any common sense: Quarantine anyone? As you approach the end, and the inevitable links to the Alien films, the ball is dropped dramatically and continuity falls apart. There is no explanation why the planet visited by the Nostromo is so ravaged, why the planet number listing has changed, why the alien jockey does not die in the correct position on the ship or why the Nostromo failed to recognise the remains of the Prometheus. There is also the scene designed to kill off numerous characters you never knew, making you wonder why they were there in the first place. This may sound like geeky picking but, really, who was this film directed at?Worse still is the editing. When Guy Pearce's oddly accented Peter Weyland is proved to be alive, and on-board, the whole ship seems to accept this without batting an eyelid. There is a rather pointless scene where Vickers is proved to be his daughter, Shaw seems to become close to invulnerable after a major operation and the aliens, who led them to this world, make no sense – especially when you take into account the opening scene. Even David's logic seems to fall through the floor and the whole film gets very jumpy, as if large sections are missing.What Prometheus gives you is a better film than the cinema release of Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection but something that is well off the mark of Scott's own epic and Cameron's sequel. The shame is, with a little bit more thought, it could have been much better. However fans will still enjoy the experience, even if it is just so they can pick holes in it with their friends later.

SPOILERS...I entered the cinema last night with both tempered cynicism and a real hope that this film should live up to its (predictable) hype. I have been a great fan of Alien, its sequels and all things science fiction since being introduced to them at an early age. Prometheus had been long in the waiting from the man himself: Ridley Scott. I hoped that unlike the unfortunate later Terminator sequels this film would really build upon the Alien franchise in an original and fresh way whilst retaining some of the Alien 'DNA' (pardon the pun)which made the original two films so great. After all, one should never underestimate the importance of a quality director (which terminator 3 and 4 sorely missed). I must also say that I approached this film from the view point of a Biologist and as such any fiction film which claims to be rooted in some sort of science (as Scott claimed this would be), attempting to deal with the creationist vs darwinian hypotheses (albeit in an overblown, entertaining way) is going to get my juices flowing, as it does for many people from all backgrounds. However perhaps I was always asking too much of this film that it should ever deal with some semi-accurate 'pseudo' science and a plausible discussion of such profound questions with a modern audience, big bucks and, needless to say, a dreaded sequel, stamped into the producers' minds.This does not mean to say that Prometheus is a bad film:The acting from Fassbender is of significant note drawing great similarities to the androids from Alien and Bladerunner that came before him. Rapace is also capable (but no Weaver) and Charlize Theron delivers a strong performance. Other supporting actors also do the original crew of Nostromo justice, although I have to say fault lies with the script for a lack of emotional engagement and care for the majority of the casts' lives. As many others have said, the film is visually stunning and the 3D worked well to immerse rather than to distract and as such the film is worth seeing just from a visuals point of view. Having watched the trailers I was worried that this film had turned all Star Trek on us in comparison to the 'gritty' atmosphere of the original films, yet it all stacks up considering the budget the Weyland corporation is said to have set aside for this particular mission.I also have to say that whilst the score is very different to the original Alien films, it is fitting to the grandeur of this particular story.Where this film really falls down is the plot. It loses it. To me it wreaks of the TV series LOST and has the disappointment to boot, hence there is little surprise that Lindelof had a big hand in creating the story. I have to say that I am very surprised Scott let this film hit the screens as it currently stands. It is as if they either wrote the story as they filmed it (LOSTesque) or just forgot to edit it. The first 45 minutes build the story very nicely and I thought we were really in for something. Needless to say it all rapidly falls apart during the second and third acts. Not only is there way too much going on, it is also at times farcical and just generally makes little sense.The writers could have gone down one of two routes: make an avatar-esque film of wonderment and human discovery (mixed with a little bit of sinister monster action) or make a full blown horror film in space (more like Alien/Aliens). What they end up with is a mediocre compromise. Whilst there are scenes reminiscent of the original Alien film (e.g. in the medical booth), there is little/no surprise or originality and (mostly due to the fact that there is just so much happening) importance/tension attributed to any of these individual scenes. Some of these scenes are just ridiculous (SPOILERS): making an alien head wake up by basically plugging it in... then doing a genome association study in about 5 seconds only to claim the alien has identical DNA to us (if it has an identical genome then why is it 10 foot and built like a God?). Another example being the fact that Noomi seemingly has the constitution of a whale and is able to run about chasing spaceships with her stomach literally stapled together. Then there is the geologist who by some miracle turns into more of a freak than he already was, before killing a load of hopeless crew and being run over by an APC to never be spoken of again. The list goes on and on. I understand that this is science fiction, but the beauty of the original aliens is that their lifestyle and the action that followed had a sense of engineered plausibility. If you were going to go down the route of making a terrifying and macroscopic bioweapon then it might look something like an xenomorph, it's as if Scott gets this science from a comic, why couldn't the engineers design an effective weapon from the start? Why do they want to kill us anyway? The film opens far too many questions and answers far too few to remain an interesting proposition. Of course it is very easy to pick holes in any fantasy film but I am disappointed by the amount of ammunition this story has provided. Undoubtedly many of the big questions will be answered in a sequel/s and I am sure there is far more to this story than meets the eye. I can only pray that Scott doesn't get stuck in a circular argument of Gods preceding Gods, for he is no philosopher.Either return to sci-fi with some original material or leave it alone, someone needs to tell the old-timers to quit while they're ahead.

I went to this film with high hopes and have created this IMDb account so that I can write a review about it. The first half ( subjectively ) of the film was great: deep and thoughtful. The acting was generally great and where it wasn't, I think the fault lies with the script and the direction rather than with the actors. The CGI was also very good, it wasn't lush and vivid as the CGI was in the film "Avatar" but it almost seemed real, and was appropriate to the tone of the film. To begin with, the 'homages' were subtle and didn't make me think (too much)of the films that they referenced. An example would be the similarity of the 'cockpit' of the "Prometheus" resembling that of the "Nostromo". SPOILERS The film began to (really) lose it's way when the two village idiots encountered the 'snakes', engaging in behaviour so benighted that one would not expect to see in a parody of a horror movie.I'm finding it hard to continue talking about this film.SPOILER I will skip a lot of inane events and move on to the 'auto-abortion'. In the film "Alien", which was great and which I love, but is not without flaws: one glaring plot-hole is how the Alien grows from being perhaps 1 foot in height to about 7'.SPOILER When Shaw removes the creature from her body it is somewhat bigger than a watermelon, when it is encountered later on in the film it has somehow grown to the size of a grizzly bear - what did it feed on?This film is neither as good as "Alien Resurrection" (pregnant Queen Alien; fecal baby Alien; poorly judged tone; miscasting) nor as good as Alien Versus Predator Requiem, which at least has the dignity to degrade by stages: possibly good film; possibly okay film; creature feature; monster mash etc.If "Prometheus" had set out it's stand as a schlocky monster movie or a comedy horror I could have enjoyed it on that level...If there's a sequel I hope Ridley Scott gets replaced by James Cameron.I also do not have high hopes for how the new "Blade Runner" will turn out.

Oh the hype. I cannot recall anticipating a movie so much. Matrix Reloaded may have come close, and the feeling of disappointment is all too familiar.This is the first time I have been compelled to write a review on this site, mainly because most of my friends haven't seen it yet and I just have to vent my feelings somewhere. But before I begin that cathartic release let me say that this is no way a bad movie. I never once had the urge to walk out and I expect I will watch it again some months down the line. I don't feel the anger I experienced after Matrix 2 or Indy 4 but I certainly don't have the buzz of having just watched a truly great movie.Lets start with the storyline. I think anyone going to watch this is fully aware by now that this is q prequel to Alien, and trust me, you'll have been slapped so hard in the face with this fact by the end of the film that your cheeks will be stinging. Time spent on plot background is over in a matter of seconds. If you've seen the trailers then you've pretty much seen the reason they're off to another planet. From there the storyline follows the usual tried and tested Alien(s) method, i.e. They find stuff, it ain't good and people start dying. What's wrong with that? You cry. Nothing is wrong with that but from then on in in you can't help yourself comparing it to the other two films. And that's where the wheels start falling off.The first two Alien movies were filled with strong characters who acted and behaved as you felt they should when their friends and colleagues start dying around them. In Prometheus however they may well have all been androids as Rapace apart, they were all taking death and destruction remarkably in their stride. Even one of the best scenes in the whole movie (Rapace's DIY Cesarean) is just glossed over like it didn't happen when . She escapes quarantine, removes a baby squid from her stomach and then runs into the others covered in blood only to be mocked for lacking scientific fibre. Theron may just have well not been there for all she adds and will someone please tell me why they felt it necessary to employ Guy Pearce to play an old man? Here's an idea, just hire an old man to do it instead!Even the characters taken as a whole are a rather strange bunch. In Alien they were a mining vessel (believable). In Aliens they took some hard asses because they were expecting trouble (believable). However on this occasion a billionaire thinks he'll take himself half way across the universe fully expecting to meet another civilisation who may or may not be hostile and who does he take with him? A couple of scientists, his daughter and a bunch of misfits. Oh but its OK, they have flamethrowers and a few pistols.Moving on to the bad guys and here we have something which I thought was rather good, as an idea. The concept of humans having evolved from an alien race is a good one, and one of the more believable parts of the film. It was a good idea tackled well. Now if we'd just stayed with that idea and made a film about it I may have been a much happier man. However Scott had decided from the outset that this would be an alien prequel and we were subjected to this absurd notion that they were sinply created by a squid impregnating a super human. Bingo! Quite why this hadn't already happened on the planet before is a mystery, as is why the Alien's don't come out looking more human every time one pops out of our stomachs. And so to the final scene which I suspect Scott saw in a ream one night and built an entire film around it. I can only compare it to Darth Vader's unavailing in Star Wars 3. Laughable.As a rule I don't like prequels and sequels. They all too often lead to feelings of anger and dismay. But I thought if anyone is going to do it right it would be Ridley Scott. Alien was his baby and there's no way he'd make a mess of it. Well now I feel its time for a public appeal. Will somebody please make a decent ORIGINAL sci-fi movie. PLEASE!

The cast was impressively fashionable, the movie trailers looked amazing, and Ridley Scott was again at the helm. What could go so wrong?The most overblown and disappointing film of the year so far starts off OK, with the scene set nicely and the tension beginning to build. Unfortunately, the story goes nowhere fast or particularly interesting. To get the audience invested in the fate of the characters they have to care about the characters, and I couldn't help myself wanting most of them dead halfway into this movie. I will say that Michael Fassbender definitely did display a sufficient emotional range for his part, however.I thought Prometheus was a separate movie from Alien (albeit with significant overlap) and tried to judge it so, but all it seemed to be doing was to try and answer questions that tied up the unknown elements of the Alien plot. In addition to that it puts together such a confusing sequence of events that one of the minor characters actually has to spell out in plain English what those answers are! Really, if you want to tidy up some little plot sidelines (which didn't need cleared up in the first place) you could maybe go down the Star Wars route and make a cartoon version instead for the especially avid fan who cares enough about it. I will say that it is always visually impressive (although I didn't think 3D was used to any great effect), but that's simply not enough any more. I sincerely hope there won't be another addition to this franchise. They've squeezed enough out of it.

Ridley Scott is back in the Sc-fi genre and he really hasn't lost his edge. Prometheus completely fulfilled my expectations and more.The movie started and from the first 30 seconds I was gripped. I didn't check my watch once for the running time or to see how long was left. I was truly gripped to the screen. as soon as the the film starts its really story building on story building on story. This movie really doesn't have a lull at any point. I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise but I went in to this film unbiased and I wanted to give this film a fair review. As soon as the film starts, it couldn't be further away from an Alien movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I found the plot to be truly gripping and I couldn't wait for the next scene to unfold. This is easily the best film I have seen so far this year and I felt it did have a unique feel to it. The actors were very well chosen apart from perhaps Guy Pearce. I felt his character could have had more screen time and his story could have been more rounded. At times the film was creepy but this is definitely not a horror movie. It has the perfect blend of sci-fi, action and a tiny bit of horror and gore but it's not overly done and it works well with the tone of the movie. The 3D aspect works incredibly well. At times I felt like this wasn't a 3D movie and then something subtle in the depth of the screen would catch my eye and I think this is where 3D works best.Prometheus is a fantastic movie and yes I do wish the connection to the first Alien movie was a little more prominent but there is enough here to really answer a lot of questions and open up new ones.

Prometheus had been pretty well hyped so I had somewhat high expectations when I went to watch the movie. To make the story really short, I didn't leave disappointed.First the good parts: The setting was a pretty interesting one. I loved the scene and the 3D worked really well - at one point I actually got fooled and tried to move my head a bit to see behind and object in the foreground. I was amazed to see the 3D in a movie work so well - although to tell the truth, I've only seen two movies in 3D so far, MiB 3 and Prometheus and the latter seemed to work a lot better. The alien life forms were pretty creepy and when the bad things started happening the horror elements were there. I'm generally not a big fan of traditional horror movies but sci-fi horror works for me and Prometheus really hit home in that regard. There was a lot of unanswered questions and clues thrown around which I personally liked, I love movies that make me think for quite a while even after the movie has ended. To summarize the good points, the visuals were great, the horror worked, the setting and the story was interesting.Now to the negatives: the characters were lacking. In a good movie you can familiarize yourself more or less to one of the main characters and feel sympathy. In addition the main characters have a story and they're introduced in some natural way in the order of things. Unfortunately this is where Prometheus failed. The two characters Shaw and Holloway, introduced at the beginning could be regarded as the main ones. Unfortunately there really isn't much in their characters to familiarize with. In addition, for some odd reason after they've found the alien structure and briefly poked around inside it Holloway gets all sad, drunk and unprofessional - a very strange reaction from a scientist in those circumstances. He's supposed to be one of the main characters but there's nothing interesting in him and he acts all weird. Shaw on the other hand gets more attention and action and reminds me of the good old Ripley but I'm still left feeling that her character was a bit shallow. And the rest of the crew? Not much to talk about. The pilot and the co-pilots are mere shadows with no real purpose or character whatsoever. The scientists were strange and acted strangely. The introduction to the crew immediately starts with a conflict among the crew members. It felt pretty strange they didn't even know each other and were acting more like wolves towards each other than fellow scientists. The guys were merely meat to the grinder and when people started dropping I didn't even notice who actually died, and I really couldn't even care. The robot David is pretty much the precursor of first Bishop but his real driving motivation is left unclear. He clearly repeats the same pattern of 'study and bring samples to home for study, no matter the risk'. Then again in the very end his co-operation with Shaw leaves me puzzled. At one point he was coldly sacrificing her and in the end helping and co-operating - felt a little bit odd to me. Strangely enough there wasn't much a joy of discovery among any of the crew members. It was like they'd found a dozen ancient alien ruins before - not going 'wow, amazing' a single time. Finding intelligent life didn't seem to be exciting to them at all which I found very odd.All in all the movie was good and interesting but it had its flaws. I feel there was bigger a focus on the visuals and the background story of Alien at the expense of proper characters and storytelling. Still the story was an interesting one and left a lot of questions open and space for a sequel, in whatever form it may come. There's a lot of open space between Alien and Prometheus to fill up and I'll look forward to the next movie, which I'm very sure will be made.

Greetings everybody.Just seen Prometheus. Quite an experience indeed. Breathless.The movie commences with a great opening sequence that pays homage to the myth of Creation. Wonderful selection of other-worldly scenery, gorgeous production design down to a T, meticulously detailed sets, beautifully designed research vessel both inside and out, painstakingly created SpaceJockey Universe, confined to the Derelict though it may be, all produce STUNNING visuals. Hence, full marks on Cinematography and VFX. Then again, this is Ridley Scott at his best. (Never mind the trolls, let them think they can spoil the party).The story, despite the rather linear flow, leaves no rock unturned, albeit it may be quite swift and take no prisoners. The subject matter is so full and intense, there is practically no room to relax. A virtual white-knuckle ride that does not relent. The theater i saw this in, nobody could stir for even one moment. And when it was over, people were dumbfounded, as though hit by a truck.Questions, yes. Plenty. Answers? No easy way out. Who made us? Can our Maker break what He makes? Who made our Makers? What is creation? Immortality? How far is too far? The sole shortcoming of Prometheus lies in the fact that it is such an intelligent enterprise which delves into the unknown uncharted universe of the beginning that the unrelenting pace of the movie does not afford much room for full character development. (This should at least have been a 3-3 and one half hour flick). Nor does it offer a denouement. No questions answered? Will the sequel to the prequel set things right? All in all, the great cinematographer Sir Ridley Scott might just have destroyed what he had created. "Why" wonders the viewer, alone, out there in the cold. So now, go figure.

Watching Prometheus is a frustrating experience. This is mainly because there is a very good film which has been folded inside an exceedingly bad film. I can't make head nor tail of Ridley Scott's pronouncements about this not being an Alien film but happening in a parallel universe. This is without a doubt an Alien film so why pretend otherwise?Let me talk about the good film. At its best this is a great monster movie with lots of action and scares. It delivers on the monsters and it delivers on the hardware. Even the CGI is excellent for once. The cast is just about perfect. I have my reservations about Noomi Rapace but she is pretty good as the Ripley-alike. Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron and Idris Elba are all outstanding and the supporting cast is equally good. It is (the good part) a worthy addition to the Alien mythology and Ridley Scott proves he can still deliver the goods after a long run of mostly forgettable films. This is clearly set up to allow for a sequel too, though I can't imagine Scott doing it. Could James Cameron be tempted?Except it's all wrapped up in some embarrassingly lame plot about the meaning of life and who made us. Worse, it's tied to an utterly awful story clearly derived from Eric Van Daniken; God was a Spaceman; cave paintings prove it etc., etc. The dialogue is just about the worst I've ever heard in a blockbuster movie and that's really saying something.There's a clear and compelling way to improve Prometheus that would make a killer director's cut. First, cut out all the drivel that happens in the opening act and start with everyone already on board the Prometheus. Remove all the "God was a Spaceman" references and insert some short scenes giving a more believable motivation for the expedition. How about – we've seen some weird anomaly in a far galaxy, let's go and investigate and see if we can find new bio-weapons for the company? Remove naff dialogue where characters discuss their beliefs. Turn up the background sounds so you can't hear the worst of the remaining dialogue. You'd be left with a 90 minute film worthy of the Alien franchise and we could all believe in Ridley Scott once again.

Well... don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the film, but...Putting "Alien" to one side for a moment, this is a pretty good film. The special effects are very well done, particularly the portrayal of the race that came to be known as Space Jockeys, which are very convincing. The characters too are likable, with an exceptional performance from Michael Fassbender as the artificial person. Tension is suitably high in places. Like I said, I enjoyed it, but... for a film that makes it abundantly clear that it is a prequel (Space Jockeys, the original Alien ship, and the Weyland Corporation) to the original Alien, there was at least one gaping hole for me that broke the connection, being the fact that the original space jockey did not die in his chair. If they could have just tied up that one major loose end, it would have sat a hell of a lot better with me. I find it somewhat baffling with the attention to detail elsewhere that they let that detail slip. Add to that the infuriation of never hearing any form of explanation for their actions from the space jockey himself, and you end up feeling a little cheated by the end of the film. Maybe my friends will enlighten me on something I missed.

well looks like the reviews are all going to fall into 2 categories: those who'd give it top marks just for the opening credits and those who think the whole thing sucks. I'm in the latter group.Don't get me wrong, if you're a fan of the series or scifi in general then it's a must see; just don't expect it to live up to the hype or offer anything new, because it totally fails to do that. It's basically a mix of a few of the older Aliens movies with updated effects, and a new heroine that legions of alien supermonsters, psychotic androids and devillish corporate villains are somehow utterly incapable of killing, although wiping out masses of other people is no problem. Predators with Adrien Brody was a much more thrilling scifi reboot.Charlize Theron is totally wasted; Noomi Rapace does pretty much what she did in the Dragon Tattoo series (the original Swedish version) - i.e. amazingly avoid death at the hands of otherwise perfectly competent killers, everyone else has a role so insignificant its not worth commenting on, except Michael Fassbender's android, who was brilliant and provided the only thought provoking stimulus in the entire film. The new super human alien forefather guys totally sucked. i don't want to give any spoilers, but the gut busting aliens had better dialouge. i hope that Ridley Scott gets dumped for the next one and they come up with a better story. Even the effects and visuals don't make up for the holes in the plot, and no they are definitely NOT in the same league as Avatar.

*PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS REVIEW HAS SOME MINOR SPOILERS IN THE BEGINNING AND MIDDLE, WITH MAJOR ONES TOWARDS THE END, IN ORDER TO BEST CONTRAST THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF PROMETHEUS. PROCEED WITH CAUTION.*Right from the first few minutes of the movie, it's clear that this Alien prequel is entirely it's own beast. The sweeping natural landscapes are combined with a powerful orchestral soundtrack, and as the origins of man are revealed to the audience the 3D only helps to add immersion to this moment. It is miles away from the desolate and tense few minutes of it's masterpiece of a precursor, representing how the movie is approached as a whole - and it unfortunately never manages to reach the ridiculously high heights of Alien. Yet at the same time, Prometheus manages to step out of the shadow of it and stand on it's own two feet. And it still manages to be a slickly executed, intelligent sci-fi film.The opening half especially demonstrates this. It even manages to remain reminiscent of Alien while it introduces Michael Fassbender's character of David, mimicking the atmosphere right down to the scrolling text describing the titular ship. Shortly afterwards, however, the remainder of the first half instead becomes a well-done ensemble sci-fi film. The (mostly archetypal) characters are slowly introduced one by one, yet they are strongly developed and all have something about them that makes them more memorable. There are light moments of humor to keep proceedings dark-but-not-too-dark, and the tidbits of information that are added to the universe's main mythology are well-timed; although some answers to long standing questions raised by Alien are a little too convenient. Damon Lindelof even visits ideas of faith versus science, though understandably electing not to answer these far too complex questions. But as newly designed creatures are introduced into the proceedings, all Hell begins to break loose. And all of these interesting elements are slowly lost. Disappointingly the film becomes a relatively straight forward monster movie from this point, and while the strong characterization is kept many of the script's other key elements are abandoned. And while it manages to answer some of the questions raised by the film itself, Prometheus concludes with an open ending. An open ending that leaves the viewer with more questions than when they started watching the film, suggesting answers in a possible follow-up instead.Yet while Prometheus is not perfect in terms of it's core narrative, it is executed to near-perfection, with little to no weaknesses in terms of it's presentation. This is helped in part by the brilliantly consistent performances, where every character has been cast perfectly and acted even more so. As mentioned before Fassbender is fascinating to watch as the android David. He lacks empathy and emotion, yet enjoys the film "Lawrence of Arabia" so much that he dyes his hair blonde and starts mimicking Peter O'Toole. He is an intriguing character from the outset, and the fantastic performance Fassbender delivers only makes his character stick out even more. The same can be said of Charlize Theron as the cold corporate figurehead, and when the small flashes of actual emotion to her character are seen, they are made all the more powerful by Theron's acting. Noomi Rapace does quite well as the religious scientist also, and Idris Elba's character as the captain of the Prometheus is very believably wry. Yet once more, it should be said that there is not a single weak performance or character throughout the film. Some are simply more memorable than others.But many of the more important elements for the presentation are entirely in the director's hands, and Ridley Scott's proficiency is flawless in this regard. His introduction of stunning landscapes happens with such frequency and such fluidity that it makes other sci-fis look pathetically small in scope. The action sequences are also well-directed and nicely done, with some brilliant body-horror moments towards the middle portion of the movie. The soundtrack is similarly epic in scale, and can be surprisingly nostalgic at times when it lightly plays on a chord or two from the original film's music. Many of the CGI effects as well are very naturalistic and fit in perfectly within the film, and there was not a single moment where use of it seemed unnecessary or even noticeable at all.And during the climax of the film, several characters confront their "makers". These creatures are the ones responsible for the aliens of Alien. They are the ones reasponsible for the creation of human beings. Rapice's character of Shaw is on the verge of breaking down, demanding to know why they were sending a ship full of alien biological weapons straight to Earth. And when David translates, how does this "maker" respond to their inquiries? By ripping off his head.And so with Prometheus, the core storyline leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. Yet at the same time this becomes irrelevant, because the film could not have been presented or executed in a better manner. Ridley's return to sci-fi is completely triumphant in this regard. And it still manages to be one of the better sci-fi films of the last few years.

Not reviewing many movies, usually because i'm too lazy, but this time it's a little bit too much.I don't know if it's because of Fox or if Ridley Scott just lost it, but this movie makes no sense. The scenario is absolutely flawed, it is centered around the most basic existentialist questions without providing any answer or making any sense with them. There's no suspense, there's no action, there's no thrill, there's nothing to think about, just scenes that are patched up one after another which make no sense overall.Maybe a director's cut would be something good, because this thing's even worse than Robin hood.Honestly, i'm surprised at what Ridley Scott's becoming, after doing masterpieces like Alien, Blade runner, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven... I mean, even Robin hood is a masterpiece compared to Prometheus, to say how low it sank...Anyhow, Ridley, please go back on track and do us some good movies again !

No one can argue that Prometheus looks incredibly impressive. It has a convincing atmosphere and makes use of an old-school look of science fiction which still feels fresh and hits all the right nostalgic buttons. The film keeps creeping up in my mind, its vagueness making me wonder how everything fits together and its style bringing about a lot of nostalgia for the things I love about Alien, one of my all-time favorite films. This would be a bigger advantage if my recollections weren't a mixed bag of excitement and disappointment. It's hard to say whether Prometheus has landed or just crashed with style. There are aspects of the plot that are genuinely interesting, where its vagueness benefits to make you ponder over posed questions. There is, for instance, an aspect of the relationship with your father (or your creator in general) that I quite like. Your father is inevitably superior in hierarchy and even though you might surpass him. He has to die in order for you to be fully independent. It is an engrained consequence of the Prometheus myth without being previously (to my knowledge) explored. But there are at least as many other questions where the possible answers show a definite lack of imagination or intelligence. One such question is how the aliens created us. The opening scene shows, if I'm correct, an alien sacrificing himself to grant the components of life to the waters of the earth. Now, either life evolves separately on earth from these components. If that is the case, then the human organism evolved entirely separately on a different planet, over the course of thousands of chaotic years (including the dinosaurs losing dominance over smaller mammals due to environmental impacts), into practically the same creature as the aliens (with almost the exact same DNA-code, mind you). This would be highly and deeply unlikely. Or we didn't evolve, but were created; our DNA-code was granted to us by this alien creature. That begs the question of why there are so many animals on this planet with whom we share huge amounts of DNA with. This bothers me, really bothers me. If it's a question of suspension of disbelief then don't be so vague about it. Neither is it something small that can easily be ignored. I don't expect all the science to be completely plausible in science fiction, but this incident isn't just some fictional science; it is engrained in its themes and its central question. The entire film soothes with questions that feel intentional to make you think, so don't punish us for doing so. It adds up to something somewhat incoherent and can feel a little underwhelming.The structure of the story is familiar; perhaps a little bit too familiar. At times it feels like it's going through the motions. Some of those motions are awkwardly uninspired, but more often they are obviously cared for and still manage to thrill and bring about a sense of awe. The creatures are better than almost any monster or alien these days and although it is a big budget blockbuster, it still understands that tension resides in mystery. The ending, however, feels a bit too rushed at times for tension to build to its peak.Noomi Rapace brings a wonderful performance, but truth be told, Fassbender steals every scene he's in. David is the star of the film. Ironically, the robot is the most fleshed out character of the entire film. Almost every other character though, has no development, no third emotion (the second emotion for all, except David, being fear) and they tend to just be plain stupid. Their manner of thinking is much more akin to a typical character of horror-films than a scientist. Jumping to conclusion seems far more logical in terms of the plot-development than as part of any scientific method. The actors, however, do a good job of making these characters feel like real people even though they fit so perfectly and obviously in the required stereotypes.Prometheus lies somewhere between a creature-feature and hard sci-fi. Although sadly it isn't the best of both worlds, but a clash of the charm and flaws of both. It has some wonderful spectacle, interesting creatures and it has some big existential questions, attention to detail and mysteries. But it also has idiotic characters, badly recycled structures, ideas and generally falls short thematically. It's too well made to hate, but too poor to love.

In an effort to avoid disappointment (being a fan of the Alien mythology), I took my seat in the cinema with as open a mind as possible, expecting nothing at all.Even the day after the late-night viewing, I'm still unsure of exactly how I feel about Prometheus, a very unique position for me regarding movies.Perhaps the equal amount of positives and negatives I've taken from the film have left me in a state of shoulder-shrugging, a view seemingly at odds with the majority of polar opinions on IMDb.As has been stated almost universally, the visuals and effects are of the high-tier calibre expected from the director who wowed audiences with Alien and Bladerunner (vastly overrated in my humble opinion).I also concede that the plot was very loosely threaded and subject to random offshoots which ended without resolution, and themes that were vague and unexplored.The pandering to religious audiences in having the two main scientists carrying crosses (Holloways tattoo is the other one) is insulting to science, a medium where factual answers are sought, in opposition to the hallelujah corner, who blindly buy into words on a book, written by goat-herders who believed that sneezing released demons.I find it incredible that in this era of knowledge, people still ask such self-centred, obliviously naive questions such as 'why are we here'? Surely an understanding of DNA reveals the answer, despite this answer being so stark and brutal that billions of humans would rather invent self-pleasing fairy tales to avoid the truth.We're here because our DNA constructed us, and our purpose is to survive, selfishly, at all costs. End of story.Even though Rapace's character finds, not god, but alien creators (viable, since DNA is involved), she still searches blindly for something there is (God), not just a complete absence of evidence for, but also absolutely no rational inclination to believe in. How ignorant.Anyway, I digress.The acting was as expected for a movie carrying a handful of well-known faces, surrounded by mere cannon-fodder, with Fassbender's android providing much of the magnetism, despite some all-too human emotions and some strange behavioural decisions, such as the drink-droplet.What I found utterly unconvincing was the blasé reaction from the other characters to the multiple deaths occurring around them, along with some of the inexplicable decisions a few of them made.Spoilers: The awakened Space Jokey/Engineer's reaction to his discoverers was also a little 'unexpected' to say the least, but then if we're correct in believing that they're out to end our evolution, it may be unsurprising.So many questions, so few answers. Was the initial Engineer who 'sparked' life on Earth acting in accordance with his species, or as an individual? Why did these beings stop visiting us? Are the Engineers' set on destroying us due to our parasitic and destructive nature? Why did Scott bother with the hastily, unexplored element of mortality, introduced by such a pointless character as the old man? Where did the chest-busters that killed the Engineers vanish to? Where was the intermittent reading of life coming from? Where was the Engineer who was discovered at the seat of the ship in Alien? Why is Rapace's character searching, when we all know that the faithful (so named for a reason) are content NOT to search, but to simply ACCEPT? As my wife has commented, this movie has more holes in it than swiss cheese.That said, there were occasional scenes that were impressive, including the Med-lab abortion, but for such moments, there were a dozen unexplained ones, such as the paranoid Fifield seeking his own way back to the ship, highly unlikely behaviour for someone who is clearly spooked, or his bizarre return as a crazed zombie, induced by the oily substance.So, in a nutshell, it was slightly confusing, with some juvenile attempts at philosophical depth, and a smattering of unlikely behavioural patterns, despite a fairly grand visual feast.Back to the drawing board Ridley. And please don't follow this one up with an even more religious offering, for in this age the shadows in which a traditional God can survive are shrinking, and rightly so. Actual knowledge is far more rewarding than personal desires and fantasies.A decent effort at a sci-fi epic, but it joins the ranks as an unfitting addition to the Alien mythos.

Now I grabbed your attention with this provocative title of my review, we can start.First of all, why this movie is better than "Alien" - well, it's not because I'm dissing or ignoring cult bliss was original movie (and sequel from sci-fi action mastermind Cameroon), not at all. I'm saying this because it's totally different movie.Bummer, isn't it? Unfortunately, FOX marketing had little choice than market is as Alien prequel, but if you are looking for better "Alien"/"Aliens", you are in for disappointment (and what quite a number of internet reviews indicates, you won't be alone in this). Because this movie, while it has very strong horror shocks (girls, you are totally warned for certain scene in this movie, be ready to close your eyes), is totally different beast - with "brain" I would say. It is very provocative, much provocative than current Darwinism versus Creationism discussion about our roots - from where we are and what's most importantly, where we are going. It doesn't assume anything, it let's story flow trough scenery and you. And yes, there are questions to be answered, but as any good movie, it rises quite a few itself. It's set in Alien universe, it has lot of common with original, but it goes in totally different direction.What can and will rise confusion that it feels that something is missing - authors choose quite risky path intentionally not telling whole story (reason why people passionately love/hate movies constructed as flashback series). However, lot of things you will get after very long hours of thinking about this movie - like beauty and significance of the first scene. It is intelligent and enigmatic and can be frustrating as any of your friends-smartypants when they smile secretly and give you small doses of information while refusing to tell big picture in one big swoop.In visual sense this movie is astonishing masterpiece - this is how space sci-fi should be made, guys (and it's cheaper than Green Lantern). Cinematography, music, sound and crushing performances from Michael Fassbender as droid David (I request an Oscar for this guy) and Noomi Rapace (NOT a Ripley, but with survival instincts and soul on her own) are things what makes this movie instant classic. What most important that waiting for another cinema grandmaster to do 3D has total payback here, Scott has done amazing things with it, first time I didn't want to throw up and run to 2D.So in nutshell, even if you feel you'll will disappointed because of direction "Prometheus" took, go out and check it by yourself, because it's worth admission. Even if you won't like it, it will make you think.p.s. one interesting thing - yesterday I thought my score will be 8, this morning 9, but now I'm ready to make it to the 10. All because of afterthoughts.

I just saw this movie in 3D.I must say that after reading some reviews I was a little skeptic.The movie for me started out slow and easy before it got darker and more creepy. The 3D was smooth, not like other movies with all the extra effort to make you see the 3D. This was just relaxing, like you did not notice that you were seeing it in 3D. It felt natural.The story was fun and exciting.All in all for me, this was one hell of a ride! I have seen all the other Alien movies 10 times or more since the 90's. And this movie delivered for me! Thanks Mr. Scott, you made one hell of a prequel! And I loved it! It was dark, creepy and fun! Just like it should be!

Well when Prometheus was announced some time ago I was more than a little excited, one because Alien is one of my all time favourite movies, and two Ridley Scott was directing. All these added together was more than enough to send my anticipation into a frenzy, then the first trailer came out. Oh my lord, that was it, I had to see this film at all costs.Then something happened, another trailer was released, then another, then another. Then viral videos, then behind the scenes stuff, then more trailers. Then I kinda guessed the storyline and the outcome of the film, and now I've seen it, I was by and large correct. The marketing over load on this film, may have been overkill. Such a shame because the teaser trailer was so promising, but I did still go and watch it and I did still enjoy the film despite guessing the storyline.Without giving too much away the film is set a few years before the original Alien film and explores the origin of mankind to the far reaches of space, but what they found may not be what they were expecting. One thing that did baffle me slightly was the technology used in the film, it made the future technology seem redundant, as the past seems far better equipped than the future, odd. But then this is both a positive and a negative, the positive being the film looks absolutely stunning, the set pieces are beautiful and detailed, the CGI is fabulous and photo realistic and virtually everything - down to the nearest speck of dust - looks good.The cast is a nice mix, but character development is missing on most of the crew. The vast majority of them are totally forgettable, so you feel very little for them, something that is usually fatal in a "horror" film. But the main guys are great in their roles; Noomi Repace is well cast, though not a scratch on the Ellen Ripley character. Charlize Theron is fine in her cold commanding officer role, but is totally under utilised. But Michael Fassbender is on terrific form and completely steals the show, as the synthetic David.Where my main issue with Prometheus lies is in its similarity with Alien, its more of remake than a prequel in a way. Thats not to say its exactly the same as Alien, but it feels oddly familiar and strangely lacking in originality despite trying its best to be original. The idea of the crew of Prometheus searching for mankind is very interesting, but in the end comes off as redundant and kinda lame. It tries to steer the film down a certain path, but it comes off more as ridiculous than ingenious. In the end you know what's going to happen which is another problem, and there is no real payoff at the end of the film. Not only that the film seriously lacks scares, the music is too loud and in your face. There is no gentle creeping and no silence to keep you on edge. The film therefore comes across more as a bad action film, than a good horror.The trouble is Prometheus tried to distance itself from Alien and in doing so made itself less believable and predictable. But in a weird way I did like how they did it, could it have been better, hell yes, but did I ultimately enjoy the film, hell yes.Prometheus isn't the masterpiece it set out to be. Its not as creepy and horrific as Alien and not as thrilling as Aliens, though it does have its own merits away from the franchise. If a sequel is made I won't be queueing round the block to see it, but I do want to come back for more. So despite a bit of mixed bag, I would still highly recommend Prometheus.

just saw this at the IMAX the beginning in 3D is amazing,but lets face it, all Imax 3D is impressive.Alas the film is not good.By no means a bad film,it left the obvious Alien fans in the theatre, utterly bemused. It is honestly a cross between Leviathan and AVP.It is shocking to be quite honest.Every one has applauded Micheal Fassbender and rightly so, he is brilliant, but his character changes from good to bad and then back to good guy and the ending is dreadful.If you have seen the trailers you have seen this film.This did not have to be an Alien prequel and suffers because of it.The birth of the proto Alien at the end almost seemed like it came out of Alien vs predator films. Damn shame.

Let me first state that I have never written a review on IMDb before, but this film was so god damn awful that I just had to write something to explain to other viewers my reasoning.Being a longtime fan of the Alien franchise, I honestly had very high hopes for this film, and even went to view the mid night screening in hopes of Ridley Scott could redeem the franchise after the AVP franchise butchered it. I was sadly mistaken.Let me state that as far as cinematics and special effects go, this is by no means a bad movie. The 3D, ships, creatures, landscapes, weather explosions and all other special effects are by far some of the best I've ever seen in a Sci-fi film, and if wasn't for the god-awful plot, I daresay I would have been completely immersed.As for the story, this film does about as much to explain the Ridley Scott Xenomorph universe as the AVP franchise itself does, and certainly makes a lot less sense than the latter in attempting to do so.The characters are completely bland, easily forgettable, by the end of the movie I walked out only remembering about three of their names thankful that it was over. You will not care who dies, and the characters seem to act completely random, freaking out when they don't need to, and acting incredibly calm in tense situations.The plot is absolute garbage, Weylen corp makes an appearance again, obviously only along for the ride for some form of personal gain, that much is made clear in the first 20 minutes. The first of the two 'big twists' are revealed within the opening sequence, and the second is figurable within the first 40 mins.Now for the rest of the nonsense plot. When Prometheus touches down, they immediately locate the base of what they're looking for (visually mind you, no radio signals or anything to guide them, they 'just happen' to land right above where they need to be) then they find a weird gene morphing goo which turns some earth worms into powerful boa constrictors, yet also causes the engineer's heads to explode, yet also turns the crew into rabid killers, yet also impregnates the main heroine with a face sucker. So which is it?No attempt is made to explain this new bio weapon, and it's effects are completely inconsistent throughout the movie. The 'tense moments' a virtually non existent and the film does nothing to draw you in and captivate its audience. To be fair, by the end, I didn't give a damn if any of them survived.Then finally when the last engineer is found in cryo, he turns on the cast and tries to wipe out humanity by flying the bio weapon to earth with no explanation as to their motives at all. Why go through all that trouble of creating a race, then getting them to come find you if you're just going to wipe them out? Then there's the final scene in which the face sucker (now about 7 feet tall) impregnates the last engineer, and the Xenomorph queen bursts from its chest fully grown. This seemed more like a tribute to the squealing fanboys rating this film 9/10 than actually making any attempt at explaining their origins.I'm still holding out for a sequel to better explain this load of garbage, but trust me, don't waste your time. Wait for the blu-ray.

We saw this film last night at a special midnight "premiere" at our local multiplex, with a packed crowd of Sci-fi and "Alien" fans. The tension and excitement was high. At the beginning the manager introduced the film but warned it "wasn't like Alien". 2 hours later the mood was quite ugly, as if a riot was about to break out, mainly because "it wasn't like Alien" This film suffers from the same problem all big hits do. They become so popular that they are then endlessly rehashed; to the point that people complain it's too formulaic and always the same. But when the creators then try to change it, or go in a different direction, the work is attacked for "not being 'X' or 'Y' enough". In many ways "Prometheus" is like 2006's "Casino Royale" – A back to basics origin story that lacks 80% of what made the series so popular, with a few little hints and name checks dropped here and there so that it can be said to be a "Bond" film even though it doesn't feel like one. So here we have effectively a re-run of the very first "Alien" – a near identical spaceship goes off to a distant planet, encounters an abandoned extra-terrestrial ship, finds something evil inside, crew is decimated, lone girl survives. However this one has NO ALIEN creature (save for one in the final moments) stalking the crew. Instead we have a couple of genetic mutations that might turn into Xenomorphs later, but look like zombies, some tentacle creatures, a 'body-hugger' (pre- miniaturisation facehugger) and the "Engineers". The "Engineers" are the films big new idea, the old Dannekin "Chariot of the Gods" extra- terrestrials that made/educated mankind, though they have been done so many times now in modern sci-fi that they are an immediate cliché. They are what were formerly called "Space Jockeys", that bizarre, disturbing creature piloting the crashed ship in "Alien" whose ossified corpse was one of the film's lasting mental images. Like Boba Fett, it was a throwaway background thing that took on a life of its own and was eventually granted an official backstory in the prequel. However, like Boba Fett, the official backstory is dull and kills all mystique. Turns out that strange, Elephant like creature we all tried to imagine as a living thing of flesh over those bones was just a spacesuit! Inside was a large white muscly man modelled on Mark Strong, our human progenitors no less, not exactly what we all secretly wanted to hear. They are a sort of "angel" who created mankind, but now seek to destroy, or supplant, us with the Xenomorph. "Why?" becomes the big question that propels the film's main heroine, Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace, a scientist who also has a strong Christian faith which directs her research. Contrary to popular myth, a good percentage of scientists are also religious, indeed science itself has always been fed by the religious impulse, and it is very refreshing to see faith not be treated with cheap contempt in a modern film. Shaw is the film's Ripley, though her toughness is of the interior rather than exterior kind: No weapons blasting or Alien fighting for her, rather it is the strength of her character and ideal that make her our heroine., and which lead her to continue her quest into the expected sequels. Michael Fassbender is excellent as the android David, though even he eventually proves to be less instrumental to the story than we first imagined. Charlize Theron is wasted as the slimy corporate type, as is Idris Elba as the jovial ship's captain. The rest of the cast barely make an impression, the total opposite of the usual ensemble cast of Alien films, and it isn't even clear who dies when and how. The special effects and the 3-D is brilliant, and makes the film a pleasing visual experience, rather like a large art instillation, but what the film lacks is narrative drive. It is as if they had taken the first part of the original Alien, then left out the second and third acts, making it the story of a group of people who land on a strange planet and find something, with a little bit of running around at the end. "Alien" motifs are deliberately dropped in to remind us we are watching one, like the opening conference (Aliens) the landing on LV233 (Alien) searching the Gigersque ship (Alien) Metal vials laid out like eggs (Alien) refusing the infected return (Alien) seeking safety in a pod then attacked (Alien 1-4) and the final radio message of hope (Alien 1- 4), but they are done so deliberately that they strike false, just namedrops to keep the fans happy. "Prometheus" tries to return to the pre-Star Wars sci-fi tradition that spawned the original film, the sci- fi of ideas and philosophy, big questions asked out there in the last unknown, but all it does is ask questions it then doesn't answer, saving those for sequels of the "to find out tune in next week!" variety. It takes out the Xenomorphs, the horror, the action, the chase, but puts nothing in their place. It is both a very bold film, for its ideas themes and visual splendour, but it is also not an "Alien" film, and not a very exciting or frightening one either, and it sets up answers we never get. It is definitely a film to see in a large cinema, and a pleasant experience, but radically alter your expectations or you will be like that riot mob last night baying for Ridley Scott's head!

The time is 3:30, just home after watching the midnight release of the alien prequel... Or not This film, while technically being a prequel, does not really explain the reason behind alien but does bring a few more questions. This however is not a bad thing. Quite far from bad actually. Prometheus does NOT leave off where alien begins, but rather sets the series up for another film.  If now you're reading bad grammar and poor workmanship I apologise but it is half 3 and I am knackered. Prometheus takes us to new places, in strange but epic ways, Ridley Scott leaves this film in a sort of prequel/stand alone limbo. Yes the film takes place before the setting I alien and does sort of explain the space jockey but does not leave us in the right situation for the start of alien. Fans will have varying opinions on this film, some will say it explains everything when you read between the lines, others will say it doesn't really explain anything... Both are correct, you need to watch the series closely to really understand the explanation; but you can come to this film anew (why would you do this... Get your ass in and watch alien you freaks) or just have watched the alien films once and not really paid attention to the films dialogue, and just enjoyed the alien eating the poor crew... Point is Ridley Scott has made a well rounded film for all the family to enjoy. I really enjoyed this film and would recommend this to anyone an everyone... Definitely twilight fans as they need to know what good acting/writing/directing is. 9.5/10 brought down by my disappointment in the finale scenes not setting up alien perfectly... But that's just meAlso the new spider man trailer was on; do not watch that trailer if your planning on going to see the movie! Yes the film looks cool, but I pretty much just watched the entire thing in the wrong order... What where they thinking, IDIOTS!!!

Finished watching this movie 2 hours ago, so here is a real fresh review: This movie does well to grasp you from reality with its superb plot line, the cinematics are clear and utterly jaw dropping, some of the best cinema to date, every scene and character invokes a sense of mystery and intrigue.Ridley Scott has pulled off a genius movie it has everything, action, mystery, horror, suspense and of course a unbelievable plot line that keeps the guessing game going and going.By the end of this movie i couldn't help thinking i had come across a puzzle, some of the characters actions were questionable, when you leave a cinema asking your friends why did he or she do this, you know there is more to come.I will give this movie a 9.5, when you watch this movie with an open mind lets just pretend for moment that its not just a movie, and mine and all your questions are answered !!

Well, Ridley Scott has struck as with another glorious looking film. The actors, aside from the Scottish guy with the Mohawk, were all brilliant. The CGI was stunning and the idea for creation was highly interesting.There is one large problem that has been annoying me since I went to see it. From trailers I could tell it would have plenty of links with Alien. I liked this and believed the film would develop into a direct prequel. The reality was quite different. Image Prometheus and Alien on two ends of a spectrum. The plot line of this film zig-zagged between the two story ideas. It was an independent film which wanted to be a prequel. The ideas were trying to work with each-other simultaneously which simply didn't work. It SHOULD have spent the first half developing and wrapping up the "engineer" idea before ending with a direct link to Alien; not splitting between the two at the end. Either that or it should have dealt EXCLUSIVELY with the "engineer" idea.So, although it is clear that Ridley was a bit TOO clingy to Alien, where the idea wasn't linked it was truly superb. The links to Alien just opened up plot-holes and pointless sub-plots which took away from the film overall.So a visually stunning film executed brilliantly but with a very confused story line behind it. If it was completely independent to Alien it would be 9/10, but it isn't, it's 8/10.

Just came back from watching it a little while ago.Could it live up to what we hoped for? No Was it as good as we could hope for/expected of it? Yeah, think so. So, no, it's not perfect, but I kinda liked it anyway.The story? - clearly a lot of thought has gone into making it and it does make sense...mostly. Unfortunately is has the same thing that most horror movies also do - people doing something VERY stupid ...that doesn't make ANY sense - other than advance the plot and f00king things up even more for the characters ...and doesn't even bother to TRY to explain WHY. Unfortunatey it can't rise above that very basic stupidity and that's too bad. I'd hoped for more.But a lot of things works really well too. Despite a few scenes that really rubbed me the wrong way for being a little too familiar compared to scenes from earlier installments - I like how it meshes really well with the already established universe. Mythology established in Alien 3 are here, and built upon, while setting up its own stuff...and even something that establishes something major from Aliens are set up here as well....and leaving it wide open for a sequel, naturally...which I hope we get. :-)However, overall it suffers from being almost too slick. Like too many other "big movies" it has, what I call, a "hyper-optimised" script. It's predictable, unrelenting in its forward storytelling momentum, and nothing is there by chance - everything matters and the time of red herrings and "fun little things" are a thing of the past. We don't get "small insignificant things" anymore - only big plot holes that are unexplained and too big to ignore.Visually it's stunning though. Nothing effects-wise to complain about. Some negative stuff there, but how could I not mention it. But I loved it and I'm looking forward to seeing it again (and again). I won't splash out extra on 3D the next time, though. The 3D, while good, is in no way needed for anything and although it may add depth to the world, you won't lose anything by only watching it in 2D.

Prometheus is about a group of people who travel to a planet where they believe the alien race that created mankind lives. What they find, though, is most definitely not the meaning of life.Now Prometheus is actually a prequel to the 1979 sci-fi classic Alien, also directed by Ridley Scott. Even though it is a prequel, it is at the same time a completely different movie. First of all, the creatures in this movie are way different than the Xenomorphs we met in the Alien franchise. Also, the cast of characters is totally different. The movie takes place 96 years before the events of Alien, so the setting and the story is very different. However it does include some references to those films, and also some well-placed fan-service that most Alien fans will appreciate.The movie isn't as good as Alien. The progression isn't as great, the creatures aren't as scary and the movie overall isn't the sci-fi masterpiece it wants to be. It's still a very good movie, just not as amazing as you would want.Overall, Prometheus is a very good prequel to a popular franchise and Alien/Ridley Scott/sci- fi fans will most likely be pleased.

This was the movie I was hoping to be the best of the year. I'd not watched any trailer for it (except for the viral videos), and thought it was going to be a cerebral experience about the search for man's origins.The opening scene was excellent, smart and visually stunning. Could see a slight homage to 2001 A Space Odyssey's time-warp ending with the panning of early earth landscapes and mountains. The scene of an alien seeding the earth set the scene. However, my heart dropped with the meeting of the crew of the spacecraft that had just reached the remote planet. They were a bunch of the most unlikeable characters you could imagine. It didn't make sense to me that a journey that would last for years would be made up of people who had never met, were unprofessional and with motivations that are totally incongruent with space travel. These are supposed to be astronauts exploring new territories but they acted more like tour guides and disgruntled employees just doing their regular day job. The rest of the film was a remake of Alien with the brown haired female character taking on the Sigourney Weaver warrior role. In any reasonable future, none of those characters would have ever been chosen for such a space mission. The only character that had any depth was the robot.This movie could have been so much more, so much more intelligent, so much more engaging, but it answered no questions and it just didn't make any logical sense.

I expected more. ALIEN + the trailer tells the whole story. There's just nothing more in this. And sadly, there's no characters and no antagonist either.That said - this is a very well made movie with tons of great effects and nice settings. Beautiful at places and down right nasty at others. Really cool.But you know - if you stretch out a film over 120 minutes, you should really have material for it. Sadly, PROMETHEUS does not have that.Sure - Scott wants to save something for the sequel to this, but we who pay to watch the film actually wants to see THIS film. Hence, this film has to stand alone - and it doesn't.Without the next installment, and ALIEN, this movie would make no sense at all - and scriptwise, it would go directly to an extensive re-write.Most significant of script errors is the lack of an antagonist. There's just no suspense in the first part of the film. The second part kicks off good - and is really watchable - but only because of cheap thrills and tricks.It's still a far better film than much else being made today, but for $120M dollars you'd expect them to hire writers that can really really write. We've actually seen much of this in tons of other films, and it's just not fun anymore. Give us something new! If it was a $1M movie, then I wouldn't complain. For that budget, this would be super.But when you play around with $120M and you still make old-make-up that looks like in the BACK TO THE FUTURE-films - then you know that someone needs to get a reality check.

Not the movie I was waiting for.Of course, it's beautiful, but this movie is so far from any basic understanding of human psychology. Scenes after scenes, decrepencies arises, and you'll find yourself at the end of the movie saying saying : bullshit.I wasn't able to fathom the scenes, especially the last one, where 1 person decides on the account of what he heards from a running compagnion that he he will be a suicide missile to save humanity. Just like this, and of course, the 2 persons with him accepts to follow him to his death, all while telling jokes about the world from the other side.

It is hard to say too much about Prometheus without spoiling it. First of all, those expecting to see the original Aliens are not seeing this movie for all the right reasons. Yes, it is part of the Alien universe and set before the first movie, but it doesn't feature those Aliens and instead tells a brand new story of merging the two worlds together.With Ridley Scott back to directing, Prometheus used the similar setup of making researchers explore an alien world, only this time there is a longer setup and more suspense driven to events unfolding. The ship in this movie is very reminiscent of the one in Alien, although it is different in design and has some new interesting gadgets and pieces of technology we haven't seen before. There's no denying that there are things people will pick up relating to Alien, and I'm really glad they didn't tone down the violence for 12/PG-13 rated audiences. Either way, you can watch Prometheus first before the other Alien movies.On the acting side of things, I found Michael Fassbender's Android character David to be the standout for the movie. I also liked the protagonist Noomi Rapace and the supporting cast of Logan Marshall-Green, Charlize Theron, and Idris Elba. All strong performances, but perhaps if there's only one small complaint I could think of, is that maybe the supporting characters didn't get enough development time. Thankfully, Scott and the team keep the movie going at a very good pace with emotional depth at the right moments.Overall, Prometheus on first viewing was what I expected, a movie using it's original base movie Alien as a structure to produce a new story with new characters/lifeforms to lead up to other Alien story lines. It is highly likely the references will become more obvious in sequels to this, but Prometheus manages to bring a story that works as a standalone but also a prequel at the same time, which is good for all viewing audiences, and I think Scott was trying to bring the grisly/dark atmosphere movies of Alien without being too in your face, which I thought was the right direction for this movie.

Where to start, OK when I first heard the rumours that Ridley Scott was going back to the Alien franchise I was so excited I could nearly explode. The potential of one of the greatest film directors re-visiting a genre defining film but with the advantages of 30 years of experience and modern techniques and equipment could be one of the greatest films ever.So to say the least my expectations where high.The trailers and speculation online and in print had whetted my appetite and the marketing machine in full swing had built my desire for this film to be good like few films before.I found myself reflecting during the screening on what made Alien such a good film, and also films like Aliens and Jaws. Directors I think work best when they have real restrictions in place with budgets and the equipment and technologies available to them. When you have to build tension through style and cinematography, when it's more about what you don't see than it is about what you can show the REAL directors step up to the plate and can deliver stories of real impact.This like so many other films lacks originality, spends far too much time celebrating how good CGI can be and doesn't bother to imbue its villain with any kind of personality or character.The basic plot is covered in the trailers, discovered all over Earth across multiple sites and throughout all history there is a common recurring theme of a star map, a location, an invitation?? So of they go, a rag tag group of scientist and industrialists with one Android looking after them in hyper sleep. From there you already know the story because it is exactly what you think it will be, only unlike the original Alien there is no tension and little conflict, no horror, no suspense and nothing original. It would be hard to invent a film language like he did in the original, but here he has followed the conventions of sci-fi like a paint by numbers film, lazy story telling but beautifully put together.

(Parents: If you have a son or daughter 15-18 years old who want to see this, consider going to the cinema with them, since lots of humans die horribly with very gory effects.) If you're a sci-fi fan who likes big budget special effects, go see this film, because Prometheus has 2 hours of flawless 3D special effects.If you're also a fan of the Alien series, though, you could either end up loving this movie or thinking Scott has completely run out of new ideas.The first 1.5 hours will basically replay large chunks of the scripts from those series. It's so like Alien you might not like it, it's ridiculous in my opinion, and likely a grab for a young audience that hasn't seen Alien; a recap.If you're an absolute Alien Freak, on the other hand, it might swing the other way. You will get a dose of Giger, even if it's the same material as in Alien, and if you didn't watch it for the characters, there's plenty of crew dying horribly.The last .5 hours is where the story develops (and introduces the sequels) and becomes interesting.The score would have been 5 due to the for me unnecessary recap and strangely unengaging characters and story, complete lack of moods and suspense being a start-to-end get-the-job-done movie. But the special effects were SO well made I had to raise it a notch, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if this movie was nominated for, or even won, an Oscar for best SFX of 2012.Full review on my blog at maximilion.wordpress.com if you want plot spoilers. ;)

If you take the original 'Alien' film, it was a thinking persons film, it was also an action and horror film as well. The problem is that 'Aliens' and the sequels started to shift the focus specifically on to the horror and action, until the final film before 'Prometheus' being the 'Aliens vs Predator - Requiem' focused really on horror. The "horror" in the last film was more based on cheap thrills and not on the script or character development/empathy in anyway.Most young adults will be more familiar with the newer cheap thrills effects sort of film in the franchise. Chances are with 'Prometheus' they wanted or expected were cheap thrills full of gore with what they got with the last film in the franchise. What we got instead was a thinking persons film with the premise based on asking questions, leading the film to be more of a thriller than a horror. In essence it returned to the roots of of the franchise beign 'Alien'.The problem, if there is one is of demographics. The target audience of 'Aliens vs Predator - Requiem' is a completely different group than that of 'Prometheus'. If you are looking for a Scifi thriller then 'Prometheus' is up your street. If you are looking for cheap thrills based on gory effects then steer clear.

2093AD, following the discovery of alien star maps on Earth, a scientific space expedition to seek out the origins of man, ala Chariot of the Gods, arrives at LV223 (NOT LV426!). But is everything as it seems..... Ridley Scott has wisely lambasted the idea of a straight sequel/prequel to Alien/Aliens, as they had been done to death. However, he felt he could re-visit some of its most stunning-but previously unexplained images-a derelict spacecraft,cargo and "space jockeys". The issue I had was that by delving into the same territory and using parts of Alien as a hook to draw interest-there was some expectation of xenomorph action. Alas not. The first act is slow and lacks the tense atmosphere that Alien/Aliens had from the start. However, it is beautiful to look at and the concept of finding the origins of man is nicely laid out. This is it's own beast, so why follow the old traits of success. When the landing party start to investigate a strange mound structure and its interior-things start to get more interesting. However, the pacing and tension are no way near as well balanced and sustained as Alien/s. The comparisons are unavoidable-the makers are using the Alien canon to tell the tale but fall short of their aspirations. Now, there are some very good things here.I Fassbenders android, is superb. Is he seemingly as ruthless as Ash from Alien, or the hidden good guy of Aliens? Or just morally ambiguous? Rapace, Theron and Elba are also of a decent standard. However, the Prometheus's crew are fairly one dimensional cut outs overall, partly due to the extra baggage of the origins idea and because there are 17 crew members. Also the script and characterisations are in no way as naturalistic as the Nostromo ensemble had in Alien. Individually, even the main cast members lack character arcs-aside from Fassbender. On the bright side, there are two very near classic gruesome scenes which tap into the Alien ideology. Its just a shame that Ridley Scott didn't hire another script writer to come in to hone and polish the third act. It becomes muddled, characters seem to be expelling exposition in a matter of a fact way to make up for the lack of explanation elsewhere. I still enjoyed the film overall, but the individual moments of brilliance do not make a classic, consistent piece. The 3D is very good,as it was filmed with this in mind. Whatever Ridley Scott was intending to create is given a nasty dose of the comical with Guy Pearce's old man prosthetics and undermines the realism and attention to detail gone before it. The last act has its moments but leaves behind a muddled batch of half baked ideas which the two script writers seem to want to just offload. I saw the origins and motives of the Space Jockey engineers long before the writers drop them haphazardly into the film. The few new ideas introduced-aside from a broader explanation of the space jockeys-are left unanswered.am being very critical but as you can see my mark is not too harse. Visually it is stunning to look at- Its more a case of I had to hold this up for comparison with the first two classic movies- which it owes its origins too.

From watching the trailers I was really looking forward to seeing Prometheus and now feel very disappointed - to the extent that I felt compelled to add my first ever review on here just to cathartically share my disappointment with others.The plot, scripting and dialogue is incredibly poor. The acting isn't great, with only Michael Fassbender coming out well from this, though to be fair to the rest of the cast they were given precious little to work with. The story lacked coherence, the action lacked tension, the science lacked rigour, reason and plausibility, the characters lacked.. well character and again plausibility... etc.In it's favour there were some pretty visuals at the beginning... and that's about it I was actually relieved when something "scary" happened as I couldn't have cared less for the characters and there was no tension or sense of dread so the overall effect was to give some respite from the creeping boredom and hopefully kill off one of the annoying characters.Seriously Ridley, if this is all you've got then please just retire and stop screwing with my memories of the good films you made. Still not sure how the guy who gave us Alien trample over that great film and give us this tepid tripe.

So I saw the long awaited "Prometheus" tonight. Overall, rather good, but the characters annoyingly and jarringly flaunted so many basic health and safety regulations regarding potential contamination, infection, quarantine and exposure to physical injury from not wearing adequate safety equipment in an unfamiliar extra-terrestrial environment etc. Maybe we're just supposed to be careless or stupid in about 80 years' time. Tsk! Also, while not being pro-god or creationist as such, it did kind of take a dump on Darwinism and the role of evolution in our existence.Being in 3D was fairly pointless. I even had to check that it was by taking the glasses off. It was, but barely noticeable.Gorgeous sets and imagery, but I wasn't too happy about what the Engineers or "Space Jockeys" look like under their bio-mechanical suits.It was plagued by thoroughly unbelievable and rather unprofessional characters as well. Dumb scientists and ship crew lacking the professional integrity you'd expect from a trillion dollar mission. Oh, and the old Weyland guy was a bit rubbish. Just Guy Pearce with lame prosthetic wrinkles. How about using an actual old man actor with an actual old bone structure? He stuck out like a sore thumb. Anyway, I have to pick fault, but it's very much worth a watch and most people aren't as picky as me I guess.I still wish they'd stop making films as if we're all dumb 15 yr old kids without any real intelligence though. And it should have been purposely made to be an 18 certificate (in the UK at least).

I keep flipping my opinion on it, I mean there were huge flaws in it but the fact its stuck in my mind shows it was pretty good. It also had a scene in it that literally made me physically squirm in my seat, during which I think I may have also mouthed oh god. Which is something that hasn't happened before.Overall it was a disappointment though, billed as "not" an Alien film, but it was and is, so you go in expecting the famous creatures and you don't (99% of the film) get them. I came out of the cinema saying to my friend there weren't any scares, but that isn't true, there obviously are, but if you know Alien as a franchise then you know the scares so its a case of same old ticked boxes rather than scare moments. Fair enough they did come up with some twists, one of which being the squirm scene, but I wasn't scared, just grossed out.I can't really comment on the 3D as I say it was my first 3D film. I enjoyed it but it was a distraction mostly, the moments it is at its best break the illusion because you think 'damn I got conned by the 3D, I'm watching a 3D film'. There was one moment I was thinking who the hell is in the way of the shot, get out the way, but it was a character in the foreground. And I'm thinking 'man how dozy are you' and then I'm not paying attention to the film. Everyone is banging on about Fassbender, and yes he was good, but his performance was entirely guided by two fantastic examples from the previous Ash and Bishop. Without them as a reference I doubt he would have come up with the same method of playing David. He was good but obvious, you know without 5 seconds of his presence that he was the android. And the dodgy android at that. The film lacked characters as far as I was concerned; I wouldn't be able to tell you any names other than Fassbender, Theron, and the Tom Hardy look-a-like (and only him because his girl said it about 20 times). Most of them were in the films as furniture, as alive as the flamethrowers. I didn't care about any of them other than Idris Elba, and maybe Charlize Theron. Who I'll talk about now, What the hell happened? You get Charlize Theron in your film, and you give her flip all. I saw her in Monster and she was insane, this almost inhuman killing machine, so she is in Prometheus and you think here we go she gets out of stasis sleep and does some push ups, looking angry, we've got some sort of evil fit Vasquez type on our hands. But no, she spends the entire film watching what is going on. The flame thrower scene doesn't count because his was such a nothing death/character. Then she has the most pointless death scene I've seen in ages. Wasted. (literally)The lead, Noomi, was pretty good. Not believable as a survival machine like Sigourney though. Her last third of the film just had me going oh god I bet that is killing when you do that. Or HOW THE HELL IS SHE STILL GOING. And would you really believe in god after all that? Just because your dad said? AND would you really forgive someone from murdering your husband(?) THE ENGINEERS. This really annoyed me, the whole aesthetic of the "space jockey" was conveniently bi-passed by saying it was a space suit. Jesus. So instead we had these giant naked albino muscle men running around trying to kill anything/looking close to tears. And the intro???? what was going on. NOTHING MADE SENSE.IDRIS ELBA. Not much of a role but he did it well, impossible not to love him. His character was a bit annoying at times, like suddenly becoming all philosophical about it or just accepting the constant death like it was nothing.ALIENS(?) the film did my head in here, there were so many variations it was impossible to fear anything because nothing really came out you twice. The original Giger characterisation of the monster is an absolute classic, but here we had snakes and a giant squid. and mad muscle men. and ink. and a baby squid starfish. I'm thinking at the end when she gets in the pod, behind the door is the beginnings of a queen alien here we go! but the giant vagina squid comes out. damn.TOM HARDLY LOOK-A-LIKE. This guy was really good looking. but totally none-dimensional even in 3D. He kept putting his feet up on everything, WE GET IT YOU'RE FREE SPIRITED. then he starts looking like Nathan Hale at the end of Resistance 2. Then the most I don't want to get involved character in the film kills him. He is that nothing.QUOTES. There were none. Alien films are great for famous one liners, especially Aliens which may have the highest count of killer lines in film history. But the dialogue was fairly straightforward, the best bits being quotes from other films "There is nothing in the desert, and no man needs nothing" a Lawrence of Arabia quote from David. and "If you can't be with the one you love, then love the one you're with" lyrics from Idris' characterSo yeah I didn't like it that much. It was a good enough film to be worth seeing, If none of the other Alien films existed I'm sure it would have semi-blown my mind. AND I'm again sure it will grow on me in time, just as Alien 3 did. AND AND Maybe there is a directors cut on the DVD that sorts it all out...

There are a lot of positive and admirable things about Ang Lee's latest Life of Pi. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda captures the most uproarious and glorious shots captured this year thus far. The 3D effects are some of the best ever seen and feels absolutely necessary in a film so heavy handed with religious tones. What Mychael Danna achieves in Lee's film has just placed him in the forefront of great film composers working today. He continues to impress with his musical range, envelopes the film's message and thematic narrative in somber and beautiful melodic notes. On Visual Effects alone, Life of Pi will likely land a nomination for Best Picture. What Lee invents with the ocean and the integration of the tiger and the other animals is spectacular. He allows the mood of the film and the imagery to marry each other in a ceremonial experience that stands next to Sci-Fi epics like Avatar (2009) and Hugo (2011).Newcomer Suraj Sharma puts a valiant effort in the role of "Pi," a performance that may land him more critical and impressive roles in the future. The work is reminiscent of great breakthrough performers like Rudy Youngblood (Apocalypto, 2006) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire, 2008); both were impressive turns but sadly will not catch any awards attention. Irrfan Kahn, who has delivered in great supporting turns like The Namesake (2006) and A Mighty Heart (2007), could have his best chance ever for serious awards attention. His hurdle will be a minimal screen presence and a supporting actor race that's crowded with "movie stars." Lee directs the film with a firm hand. He knows what he wants to say and for the most part gets his message across. Unfortunately an unfocused and at times jumbled screenplay by the great David Magee creates an atmosphere that relies more on the visuals then the narrative. Also, I'm unfamiliar with the book by Yann Martel, never read it before, so I have nothing to compare it to but much of the story's elements of surprise feel rather cheap and ill-fitting. Not sure how it will play with others but the film remains pretty consistent on the entertainment sector. Lee explains his preparation for the film at the New York Film Festival with such passion and delight. He speaks about getting Sharma properly prepared by placing him on a boat in the middle of the ocean and meeting a real life shipwreck survivor; Lee's love for the project comes through, all four years in the making. It's a directorial achievement that the Director's branch of the Academy could easily get behind. The film lands solidly on the front door of awards season with ease and could rally a loyal legion of followers. Look out for the National Board of Review to kick it offI can almost put money on it.Read more reviews @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)

Saw this the other night at the NYFF. Wow. It's an incredible film, a true cinematic achievement, possibly a classic and maybe will be the first 3D movie to break through and win the Best Picture Oscar. Some of the images were so beautiful that the audience gasped at many of them. I felt transported and like I was seeing a movie for the very first time. I haven't felt that sort of magic in a movie theater in a long, long time.I read the book and liked it and the film may even improve upon it which is kind of a miracle considering it's kids, animals and water just about all the time. The spiritual themes are simple and deep and raise more questions about faith and belief than answer anything. No preaching going on here and there could be. Without giving anything away, it's a wonderful story about storytelling and how telling our stories can get us through the most horrible life experiences and to help deal with the aftermath of them.It's an incredible film experience. Go see it!

I was lucky enough to see Pi in full 3D Imax at a pre-viewing in San Diego last night, and as a huge fan of the book, I was intensely satisfied.Believe it or not, I was more impressed with the the casting choices and performances of the players than by the effects. Granted, the movie was very beautiful, but in the end, Life Of Pi was more character driven than anything. Suraj Sharma as the young Pi was charming, funny, and incredibly engaging, while Irrfan Khan as the older Pi was fantastically genuine and warm. Adil Hussain as Pi's father was also a joy to watch. The characters are so rich and full of life that you really can't help but fall in love with them. I would also like to add, as someone who spends time with tigers on a daily basis, the animators did a wonderful and accurate job of bringing Richard Parker to life and making him the active and vital character that is so incredibly essential to the success of this story. I would recommend seeing Pi in 3D, but I don't think that's it's essential to your viewing enjoyment. The 3D just takes a beautiful film and makes it a little bit nicer. Also, if you've read the book and are concerned that the story you loved may have been compromised in anyway, worry no longer. This is easily, one of the best book to film adaptations I have ever seen.Happy viewing folks. I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did. I'll be seeing it again in theaters very soon.

Few movies will leave a lasting impression on you..Life of Pi is one of those. Not even a single moment is dull, in fact the story is woven so tightly that you never realize that the script is so simple. It is beautifully directed and kudos to Ang Lee, not only was he able to capture the beauty of India, he was also able to get the best of the actors. Though it does not rank too high on 3D, its just visually mesmerizing. My trust and faith in Ang Lee has gone up to the highest level after watching this movie..Luckily I was able to catch the premiere show and will continue to relish the after effects of the movie for the next few days!

We were able to see this at an early screening but per that paper, not to say anything until after other screenings. So, now it's screened elsewhere I can pitch in my thoughts.Life of Pi is a film that absolutely surprised me. I had not read the book, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I knew that a film from Ang Lee would be exceptionally well done, and I wasn't wrong. This is an incredibly strong work, on par with "Crouching Tiger" .. Not through action or events but in the way the cinematography, camera movements and beautiful settings help draw a viewer in and really sell the story.The Life of Pi is so well crafted that it moves effortlessly between a story of youth to a story of adulthood. If you have not read the book, the ending is the kind of twist that while completely understandable redefines your entire film experience in a way I hadn't been a part of since "The Sixth Sense". You immediately think back over the entirety of the film and see it in a drastically different way and it works.No matter the perspective you chose, this is an amazingly well acted, well directed film that goes into my list of some of the best films I've seen this year.I watched in 3D, but this is a film full of so many bright colors and scenes that I will seek out a chance to see it in 2D just for the beauty of the scenes. Strongly recommended.

i just watched the 3D IMAX in Taiwan. Due to i'm big fan of Ang Lee, i look forward to this movie for a long time. I'd like to say this movie totally meet my anticipation. The animation was real and beautiful, so the scene was amazing. Some scene and action taking from different views was also impressive. This movie was pretty hot and being discussed much in my country now. Some scenes are taking in Taiwan. I did not watch the book so i can't compare between book and movie. I recommend 3D caused some view will really touch you. For kids it is alright cause some bloody scene was adjusted. I think it is more than a story, there are many points worthy of thinking. Nice try and nice working of Ang Lee!

Just finished watching the Midnight Premiere. Did not disappoint one bit. The Acting is incredibly believable, and the ending ties it all together. The story sorta drags in the beginning, but Ang Lee did a good job keeping my attention to the film. The Animation is incredibly realistic. I couldn't tell the difference between what was real and what wasn't. Not one moment did I doze off. Definitely worth 127 minutes of your life. Ang Lee, you did an outstanding job. To the Cast, you all did excellent. I am very satisfied! Although there were a lot of pros, there were some cons. At one point the Format of the Film switched from 16:9 to 4:3, but that might have been the projector at the Cinemark I attended. I also noticed some of the animations of animals started to go off screen and you could see the animated objects in the black area of the Wide Screen part (I'm assuming that was for the 3D, but I watched it in 2D so it looked sketchy). But it's minor. An average viewer won't even notice it, I'm an aspiring filmmaker, and I notice the little things!! I enjoyed the film, and you will too. 9/10. Worth it.

The movie narrates an incredible story using the most beautiful special effects and great actors.It is more that a survival story and it is not about friendship. This story is about faith. Director Ang Lee use all the tools he have to make this movie about a solitary young man not a boring one. It is narrated by both, young Pi and the Adult Pi, it uses music all the time so there is not space for uncomfortable silents and the rhythm of the scenes is fast. The result a very entertained film.The most important thing of this film is it character. It is obvious because we are seeing for almost 2 hours just one character. So it is not only important to have a great character that appeals to the audience feelings, but to have an actor that portray this person the right way. Suraj Sharma was brilliant as Pi. He can make happy scenes as equal as sad, desperate, hopelessness, exhaustion and anger ones. Very few movies allow an actor represent so many emotions.But if Pi is a good character, Richard Parker can only be describe as unique. The tiger as personality of it's own. Not many films can make an animal with so many human features and yet never stop being a wild animal. This tiger is computed animated but the audience will barely notice, because the way it walks, eats, its factions, the eyes. It doesn't matter if it is computer animation, Richard Parker is alive and is his own character just as important as Pi is.If you think that "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" have good animal effects, you have to see how this people make a zebra, a hyena and a orangutan. All this, combine with a photography created by the same guy that make "Tron: Legacy" looks so cool and "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" so beautiful, Claudio Miranda, makes it an incredible experience to see.This movie is definitely an Oscar runner for Special Effects, Cinematography, Director and Movie of the year.

Ang Lee makes good looking movies. Here again, he is meticulous in his craft and it shows on the screen.The problem with the Life of Pi is it starts too soon and ends too late. Because it is a story in flash back you know PI survives. If you have seen a trailer you know the movie should start with a great ship wreck scene. It takes to long to get there. End after the rescue. That interesting shaggy dog story from the hospital bed that was heard, not seen, was not needed and not cinematic. The movie looks and sounds good but it is redundant. How many storms at sea are enough? The movie might have trouble finding an audience. It looks like a family movie, but it is too violent and intense for younger children. If you go to see it, take your lead from the tiger. When the tiger leaves, you should too.

''I had to tame him,'' (Pi) realizes. ''It was not a question of him or me, but of him and me. We were, literally and figuratively, in the same boat." From Life of Pi by Yann Martel.You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century.The film begs interpretation from the multiplicity of religions to the place of mankind in a hostile, Darwinian world. Ultimately the benign brotherhood of beasts and humans is affirmed not so much by lofty philosophy but by the necessity of man and beast working together to survive.The digital rendering of animals, especially the Bengal Tiger, is beautiful to behold. The opening scene in Pi's family zoo could be right out of Terence Malick's visionary camera, a montage of nature gorgeous in its simplicity. The several formalistic shots of the boat at night are worthy of the best lighting in the best aquariums in the world. Together with the impressive use of 3D, director Ang Lee has visually taken us from the opulence of Crouching Tiger and the minimalism of Brokeback Mountain into a fusion world of fancy and reality. The images are stunning.In the end, Lee is interested in the individual's place in the universe as he struggles to harness nature and yet live in harmony with these elements. The conflict with the gross cook aboard the Japanese cargo ship taking Pi's family and animals to Canada is emblematic of the challenges facing the gifted with the groundlings. Pi's relationship with tiger "Richard Parker" represents all mankind's struggle to live in harmony with the forces it cannot control."Believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing," says Pi's father because Pi samples religions from Hinduism and Buddhism to Catholicism and Judaism and wants them all. Although it is not given to us to have them all, Pi's piety practically makes us believers in the universal brotherhood.The Life of Pi is everyone's life; the film is one of the best of the year and, even remembering the greatness of The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick, and Billy Budd, the best you will ever see about a boy, a tiger, and a boat.

I've had a positive opinion of Ang Lee in the past. But having seen this movie, I think his stature and the state of the financial world is ruining him. The best movie of his I've seen was Eat, Drink, Man,Woman. I found that truly original and accessible. This movie seems more influenced by things like Thor and The Avengers. Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much use of special effects. Plus, the storyline is way too much like The Namesake. Both movies have Irrfan Khan telling a story, including an explanation of the name. Gogol or Pi. Tabu was the main female character in both. Both protagonists end up in North America. Mira Nair told the story of The Namesake in the same way that Ang Lee told the story of Eat, Drink, Man, Woman, very personally and with some subtlety. I really prefer Mira Nair to tell Indian stories. I even prefer Danny Boyle. Ang Lee is, at best, third. He approaches it with the awkwardness of a foreigner.Slumdog Millionaire and The Namesake didn't burst like sensations on the movie scene. But once word of mouth got around, they ran for months and months. I am skeptical that Life of Pi has that kind of legs.

I gave this film 10/10 because it is really touching and lets people think about things around us. I didn't expect it that good since I haven't read the book. Probably Ang Lee's directing made me want to see how it works, but it turned out very amazing. The film is not perfect, you can see some goofs in it. It is a sight feast in terms of pictures. The whole story and journey that Pi had been through is well told, and at last Pi told a different story, which really made me think about things around us. Many times what we believed is perhaps not the truth...but when we find something that is worth to believe, we shouldn't let it go even if we may lose everything we cared about, they will come back eventually...Anyway, it is really a good movie, worth to watch!

It is very hard to give this masterful creation of Ang Lee a tangible rating and critic, because much of the takeaway of the film, is for the moviegoers and readers of the original novel to contemplate. It is also very hard to rate because it has been such a hard movie to make, out of a novel that addresses both the strength of faith and weakness of humanity in a rhetoric way.Ang Lee did it, although painstakingly. I was amazing by the soul of the film, thru the eyes of the Bengal tiger (amazingly) and the maiden acting of 17-year-old non-professional actor. The conversation about the journey of life that Ang Lee has succeeded in engaging us into is a special kind that few artists like him is able to deliver.The opening music is magic.The one point I deducted is my faith in Ang Lee. I will save that for his next film.Happy Thanksgiving, movie lovers.

Next up on my Thanksgiving weekend reviews is the newest novel based movie called Life of Pi. This past summer I was captivated by the wonderful trailer that was visually stunning and had a killer soundtrack that matched the flow of the trailer. When I found out Ang Lee was directing it I got even more excited that this film was going to be an artistic wonder. Since I hadn't read the book though, I had no idea what else I was in store for other than a modern version of the Cast Away movie. So what did this movie have to offer? Read on to find out.For those who haven't seen the trailer or read the book, Life of Pi is the tale of a man named Piscine Patel, known by most as Pi, an Indian boy who likes to question many rules and discover new lessons. On the voyage to a new home in Canada, the boat Pi and his family are riding capsizes leaving him stranded with a few animals and some rations on a small lifeboat. The teenage boy will discover a world he never imagined, while struggling to maintain his life in the lonely world of the ocean.That's pretty much the plot, so you might wonder what makes this movie different from Cast Away, other than the main character is Indian and there is a tiger. I'll start with talking about the visuals of this move, which for me and a couple of my buddies was the best element of the movie. From the get go, the cinematography is amazing capturing the natural beauty of the Indian continent. As the opening credits start, the audience is treated to some well angled shots of the various zoo creatures, each doing their own thing as if nothing is happening. Once the movie officially starts though, the camera work continues to get better, with every angle being selected to get the most out of the scene. Even the chaotic scenes aboard the sinking ship were well captured, skipping the chaotic camera angles for the use of CGI and visuals to create the feelings of uncontrolled fear. When calm eventually returns the desolate world of the vast ocean is impressively recreated on the screen. Many of its inhabitants are well polished and designed to have you thinking they are real, that is until you get a closer look. Upon focusing on the actual creatures, you can see where the realism starts to blur a bit, as the animals become a little too polished and clean. Despite this though, the animation for the animals is still impressive, capturing their movements to the finite detail and adapting them to the interaction with Pi and the tiger. Thus the artistic aspects of this movie are definitely prevailing in this movie. A second big quality of this movie is the spirituality built into this feature film. Before even pushing out on the boat, Pi begins experimenting with multiple religions, each being explained in their connection to the deities. Those interested in religion will get a nice refresher course in theology; though will appreciate more of the practice in this movie. Scenes where Pi prays or talks to God are sure to strike up some feelings in fans, whether good or bad really depends on the person. For this reviewer, it did make me thankful for many things, and helping strengthen my spiritual connection. There are even a few other scenes that seem like a trippy experience into the spiritual realm that is visually beautiful, but still a little weird. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film. What else is there to mention about this movie? Well I can warn you now that there are some graphic scenes of life that may disturb some people. I admit that some of the animal hostility in this film made me very sad, and could make little kids cry their eyes out. Despite this sadness though, I have to admit it is very realistic as when fighting for survival animals can turn into savage monsters. Those looking for a story with lots of twists and turns are also advised to skip this movie as well, since it is little more than an Indian boy fighting for survival and documenting his adventure. However, those who like movies that dive into the mind and character are going to be up for this film. Another thing about this film is the pace of the movie keeps things a little slow. Again this is a life adventure, but did we really need over two hours of film to see this? For this reviewer not really, as half an hour less could have helped with the long dragging feeling of this film. The acting by Suraj Sharma was very passionate at many points in the movie and well representative of the emotions. Unfortunately some of the scenes forced him to be a little too passionate in his yelling, leading to a little over-dramatic tension.To wrap this review up, Ang Lee and company have created a visually stunning masterpiece that makes you think about your spiritual beliefs. With award winning animation, polished creature design, beautiful settings and cinematography, and some well done editing, it's no doubt this movie will be a candidate for best visual effects. What could have made it even better though was adding a soundtrack like the trailer to further bring out the magic, instead of just using it for the sad scenes. Regardless this movie is best seen in the theater with the visuals, yet if you go for plot wait until it releases on Netflix. My scores for this movie are the following: Adventure/Drama: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0 please email rkarim11@su.edu for constructive criticism

This movie is very good. Not life changing, but very good. Pi's adventures are very inspiring. You can catch yourself mentally cheering for Pi and the tiger.***Spoiler Alert***I say this only for the sake of advising people about content*** Don't be fooled when the parental guidelines say that there is no fighting and intense scenes. My nine-year-old sister who usually is perfectly fine in movies was very upset and disturbed by this one. There are some sad scenes including the following: It shows Pi as a young boy trying to feed a tiger at his father's zoo. His father comes in and witnesses him doing this, and not only does he harshly scold him, but he decides to teach him a "lesson". A man brings in a live goat and ties it to the tiger cage. Pi's Mom is shown covering Pi's eyes and we later see the tiger with a bloody goat in his mouth.Pi is on a boat with lots of animals. There is an intense storm that may be frightening to younger kids.During the storm, the boat sinks, killing Pi's family. Pi is the only one who makes it out alive.Pi is on a lifeboat with a zebra, hyena, orangutans, and a tiger. Things quickly get out of hand. The hyena kills the zebra, and Pi is on the verge of killing the hyena when the orangutans and the hyena start a fight. The hyena ends up killing the orangutans. The tiger swoops in and kills the hyena, but Pi is now in danger. This is all shown very graphically, and it's the most intense part of the film.Sharks are shown as a threatening thing in the water throughout the film.Pi and the tiger are on an island with lots of meerkats, and the tiger eats some of the meerkats.It looks at one point that the tiger will die.Pi has to make up a story in the end of the film which is very disturbing.That is about all of the intense scenes in the movie, but another point is that the movie is very religious, and some young kids may be bored by that. For a PG movie, this is fairly intense. I would advise not taking a child younger than nine or ten to this movie unless the child is 100% always okay with all movies.

The symbolism of PI a mathematical annotation to irrational numbers has perhaps not been captured so beautifully ever in cinema !! Those who know India and have had the experience of spending even a few days in this enigma of a country know how confusing yet subtly philosophic this country is ...and this is exactly what the cinematic masterpiece from Ang Lee portrays ......To discover who you really are , you need to be thrown in a situation which tests your limits and then "wisdom" will be given to thee. I have not read the novel so i did not actually know what its all about when I walked into the theater and was pleasantly surprised at so many insinuations & portrayals of the Indian way of thinking of universal brotherhood. Ang Lee keeps the things in a different realm of reality which we all acknowledge does exist but perhaps are afraid to "test the waters" since we as human beings are conformists by nature and can not leave our "comfort zone" to think things in a way they should be thought of .......this is exactly why the director succeeds in drawing our attention to small but significant things which need to be understood to make the path more worthy of further discovery......Truly world class cinema with great acting and I will not hesitate in adding that the "tiger" who plays Richard Parker does deserve an Oscar this season .........

Ang lee's life of pi is an adaptation of a 'Man booker prize winner' novel by the same name, written by Yann Martel. It's a story set in the late seventies of an Indian teenager (Pi Patel) who is stranded on a life boat in the pacific. What distinguishes this tale of survival from the rest is that the author dishes out a delicious slice of creativity in giving the castaway, a tiger for a companion. Yes, like the posters and trailers have you believe, there is a boat on which a man and a tiger have to live! This makes 'life of pi' not only a story of human struggle against nature but also a profound tale that questions 'what separates man from beast?'. More interestingly, 'when does man become a beast'? But worry not, Ang Lee's movie does not force you think on these lines , instead it's a film that lets you enjoy it on so many levels. If you are just looking for a beautiful 3D movie to feast your eyes , Life of pi can be it. If you are in a mood for a thrilling adventure epic on weekend, this is the right ticket. If indeed, you want to experience something thoughtful, Life of pi never forces you on a particular thought, instead it whispers ever so slightly to think about matters of human disposition and finding comfort in convention while caressing your senses with fabulous visuals and background score. Suraj Sharma debuts as pi with utter sincerity while Irfan Khan(as adult pi) and Tabu(as mother) do justice to their parts. The rest of the supporting cast blend in perfectly too. Ang lee helms the film with difficult source material with absolute grace and expertise. However there are two true heroes that make Life of Pi work. Firstly the studio and creative director behind the magnificent CGI. The Bengal tiger is perhaps the best animated animal ever created! The angry green eyes, richly textured orange –white striped skin and every hair on its fur look rich and full of life in 3D.And then when your hear the thunderous roar for the first time, you will realize this is as real as it can get! The rest of the animals (a Zebra, an orangutan) look great too. The lovely blue ocean and its resident creatures are the jewel in the crown. The other hero is the writer David Magee(screenplay) who adapts the novel with near perfection. One gripe the fans of the novel might have is the lack of all the gore descriptions and a particular chapter that deals with the surviving 'French cook'. The addition of these might have pleased the audience who sought for the philosophical undertones from the story but the film would have lost out on the large PG-13 crowd (a fair deal considering the enormous budget). Life of Pi, is a rare masterpiece that stands as a prototype not only for a perfect book adaptation and a 3D movie( sorry avatar, you have just been replaced), but also for a movie based on intricacies of human nature . Now that is simply an impressive triumph of film-making!

According to mythology the journey of life is splayed with different forms of hurdles, the path to salvation lies in standing tall against such hurdles even if the Gods are callous to your understanding. By maintaining hope we try to live up to their expectation, knowing that God will guide us if we keep fighting on our endeavor for greater good. That's pretty much the whole and soul of the movie. Opened first time in India at IFFI 2012 Goa, I was in the mix of lucky few who got to watch the repeat show of this 3D movie adapted from Yann Martel's book of same title.Piscine Molitor(Pi) Patel as he was named after a swimming pool by his dear uncle apparent by his ardent love for the same. Piscine is born Hindu in Pondicherry India, but as he levels a understanding he begins to peek into other religion and sooner he starts endorsing Christianity and Islam also. His father, a zoo owner pounces upon a chance of relocating the zoo to Canada. On their way to far west with animals on a Japanese ship, tragedy struck on a murderous stormy night capsizing the ship with Pi and a Royal Bengal Tiger left to see the remains. And so the adventures journey of innocent young boy with life threatening feline animal begins.There was the thunderous applause from the audiences when the tiger gives his first appearance in the safety boat. Spending months to produce the Tiger didn't go waste too, he looked inch perfect and the way he has been handled in the movie is exquisite. The first few scenes are reminiscent of old India with bullock carts, later the landscape changes and so do the people. The characters of hot blooded modern day father, the supporting mother and the story involving the tender love between the protagonist and the girl are delightful however short they may be. The innocence of young Pi through his school years and his introduction to motley of faiths sets up the foundation to his uncanny characterization. But the real fun starts when they are both lost at sea and Pi tries assortment of ideas to keep him as well as the Tiger alive. The movie is never complete without the mention of adequately yet delicately used VFX. It would really be a shame to put into words those magnificently shot sequences and the scale on which the art work is done. This movie epitomizes the correct com-mixture of story with special effects. I could gather so many 'wows' while I was myself devouring on the same scenes. The humor is well prevalent and does lighten up the few still scenes between the two.Suraj Sharma plays the most significant role in the movie with all his efforts and he wins it in the end. The guy is awesome handling some tough intense scenes in the movie. Irfan Khan playing the narrator as well as the older Pi shows his maturity in the business, patient with the small parts he never misses his character and his narration and dialog's delivery is to die for. Adil Hussain as Pi's father is superb with his character and does contribute a hell lot. Other actors contribute evenly including the computer generated zoo animals. Real salute to the art directors of the movie for putting up such beautiful pictures on screen. Ang Lee is as always incomparable with his cinema, he has definitely reached shore with this movie and a more versatile director in my book.The older promises the character he is narrating that he will prove him that God exists, well did he or not? For that you have to wait for that amazing climax scene. This is art, storytelling and VFX at his best in a single movie. Who would want to miss that??

Well, one of most expected movie of 2012 by me. It was not a colorful visual movie like 'Avatar' which was bluish Or 'Hugo' which was orangish except in few scenes that too come in night shot though IMO you should not compare it with above two. Many part of 3D sequences were just awesome.It could have been more violent and sentimental story that ever told on this theme but not, the director cleverly blended the humor with character emotions very nicely, thats why it was just ratted PG where children are allowed with their parents approval, but it is common for them to see an animal to kill another in Animal Planet, so its not a big deal i think. The CGI animal(s) were looked so clean and good.I must say the movie don't offer what you expect from its trailer, in movie it was totally different than any movie in the world except Waterworld + Cast Away + Castle in the Sky = Life Of Pi, i am not comparing it to other 3 but saying got similarity in some parts.I did not like the end much, I mean the way it ended was not proper, I thought it still had something to go far away then realized it happen only in commercial movies.My question is can this movie do good business which got no big names and cast!? Indian cast, Taiwan's talent, American product and a great effort of various technicians from around the world is equal to LIFE OF PI in Pacific ocean over 227 days. Hoping it gonna grab couple of awards in Academy award. Worth watching it in 3D, Someday in future you can say that i was in there when it came out when it called epic like what we call some of classical movies today.You could see better and beautiful India in beginning few Minutes than any Hollywood movie which deal on Indian subject. people from in and around Pondicherry can feel proud, why not whole Indians can. The images from the movie will remain in our eyes for some time even after you left the cinema hall specially may be you won't forget the name Richard Parker.And now i go for 9 outa 10 saying must see specially we Indian coz we cant make movie like this at least for right now in our own but we can watch this western piece of Indian art carved Ang Lee.There is a chance it gonna replace 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' as his (Ang Lee's) best, i said may be so lets see. Might be i am little excited for seeing it in preview show lets see what happens later days and what others say.9½/10

Unlike most of the movies adapted from books that don't live up to their source, this movie has done more than justice to Yann Martel's book. The introduction to India, the music, typical school life etc have been very well portrayed. The music interluded with Indian classical tunes on Tampura and flute was wonderful. The emotions and feelings that go to and forth between Pi and Tiger while abandoned in the sea are remarkable (although Pi should have a been more emotional when he loses his family). Mr Lee has blended 3D computer graphics very well into the main story line without getting the audience bored (though once there was a feeling that CG would have been avoided in some places). The movie had space for a subtle fun too which was acted out very well by Suraj (Pi). Finally you get to really contemplate about the movie once you are out of the theater about questions like Faith and Life! Great movie to watch.

Life of Pi is one of the most marvelous theater experiences I've had all year. Its Oscar for art direction and cinematography should already be locked in. It's a film of incorruptible beauty and deeply satisfying drama which squeezes so much power and emotion out of its audience that they leave feeling riveted at the same time drained. You can bet the film's main character feels the exact same way.Our main character is an adult named Piscine Molitor, who goes by the name "Pi Patel," and we meet him as an adult (played by Irrfan Khan) who begins telling his long life-story to a writer planning to adapt it (Rafe Spall). It's a story that tested him as a person in every possible way, and it all goes back to when his parents made the decision to move from India to Canada, and because Pi's father was a zookeeper, take many animals such as orangutans, zebras, goats, and tigers with them on an enormous ship across the Pacific Ocean. Before this move, Pi was an optimistic soul, who ventured out as a young boy beyond his comfort zone in his Hindu religion to seek out other walks of faith, specifically Christianity and Islam, which he began following all at once.During the move, a wild, violent storm hits the ocean, flooding the ship and sending Pi, a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, an orangutan, and a tiger named "Richard Parker" on a lifeboat, leaving behind the several other animals and Pi's entirely family. This whole sequence, which lasts around five minutes, feels like the entire movie The Perfect Storm shortened from its original two-hour length, only it emphasizes the emotional elements. This is one of the saddest scenes of the year, as we see a teenage Pi (now played by Suraj Sharma) desperately hold onto the lifeboat for dear-life, while being washed away from his mother, father, and siblings and there is absolutely nothing he can do about it. Between you and I, reader, this is one of the most emotionally upsetting scenes (this and the ending of the film) I've ever sat through in a theater.Now, Pi is stranded in the middle of the Pacific, with an open sky, four different animals, until they are picked off with only the tiger remaining, and his own will to live. The remainder of the film forgoes the back-and-forth narrative between adult Pi telling the story to the writer, but remains focused on his own recollection of events on that lifeboat and the acts of bravery he committed to keep him and the tiger alive. While Pi and Richard Parker are sharing the boat, that does not mean they get along. Writer David Magee makes no mistake in illustrating that while they are stranded together, Pi is a human boy and Richard Parker is a Bengal tiger. The beauty of this picture is that it never mistakes that the only common traits between these two souls is that they are stranded together and both are mammals.Life of Pi's visuals are astounding. Long shots that hold on the vast emptiness of the Pacific are invigorating because of their wide range of beauty and clarity, sequences of peril and uncertainty are captured through an equally clear, vivid lens, making them all the more real and enthralling, and atmospherically, the picture shows the dangers and the loneliness of the ocean better than any film I have yet to see.Thematically, the picture focuses on predominately on the idea of survival and spirituality, which gratefully helps Pi keep hope and optimism during these gruelingly unforgiving days. One of the most intense and poignant scenes comes when Pi is faced with the task of killing a large fish. He is starving, and becoming skinnier by the day, so he fiercely grabs a fish out of the water and begins hacking at it with a small axe. When the fish is bloody and long dead, he begins to sob tears of joy and sadness; joy because he finally has a decent portion of food, yet sadness in the idea that he has killed a living creature and is about to abandon his vegetarian vow. It's a scene that, once more, clouded my eyes with tears, just like Pi's, of joy and sadness. This is a picture of sheer power and beauty. A film that clearly tests its lead actor, Sharma, who is inhabiting his first main role, and a film that will hopefully go on to live with a reputation of one of cinema's supreme achievements. It must be said that in Ang Lee's twenty year film career that he has tackled almost every genre in the medium and done so with an extraordinary amount of confidence. His directorial efforts too have not been minor additions to the genre, but true game-changers if anything. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a martial arts film filled with depth and delight. Hulk was a superhero movie that added so much weight to its characters and relationships, you'd think Christopher Nolan's modern-day Dark Knight franchise was taking notes from it. And Brokeback Mountain was, for the most part, a lively portrayal of two men who've kept their orientation silent for so long that they begin to embrace it by meeting each other out of the blue. Life of Pi offers more of the same grandiose ideas from the brilliant visionaire and its shocking smoothness in terms of filming, placement, and writing is beyond fabulous and wildly consuming because of its clarity. This is one of the best films of the year, and on-par with the depth and cinematography in Samsara, making this year one of the most beautiful.

I watched this movie in Imax 3D yesterday! And boy, was I stunned! I haven't read the book so I will not compare the movie with the book. But, the movie in itself is pure pleasure for the senses, both external and internal. Its like a feast being laid out before your eyes, and eyes you wouldn't wanna blink! This is the best 3D movie so far (yes, even better than Avatar). The 3D and effects aside, I think its the story and the direction by Ang Lee that keeps the viewers engaged. And of course, the ferocious Royal Bengal Tiger, named Richard Parker. If only, animals could be awarded for their acting, the tiger would get the best actor award. The best scenes of the movie are the nighttime shots of the vast Pacific ocean and the underwater sequences. I didn't like the ending of the movie though, which made me doubt what I saw from the start. The spirituality aspect is delivered in plenty in the movie. Afterall, its a tale of survival against all odds. The movie is a winner because it delivers a simple tale which would have been so difficult to film in a manner which is not only beautiful but also humbling.

This movie took me by surprise. I thought it was just about a young boy and a Bengal tiger trying to survive on a small boat. But it was much more than that, for it conjured up thoughts, spiritually, visually, and intellectually. The actors were amazing and so, the Director Ang Lee. If you do see it, try and catch the 3D showing featuring the largest BTX screen/ multi-channel surround sound. I'm positive it would still be satisfying without those perks, but you will enjoy it much, much, more because it brings you into the location physically. I almost got seasick watching it because the huge screen was so, all encompassing. This movie features an all-Indian cast with acting skills displayed beyond the norm. Everything was so natural, as if no script was ever written. Spontaneity abounded throughout the film. The only negative: the theater turned up the sound too loud.

Watched "LIFE OF PI" Movie is good. Story is based on a novel by Yann Martel with same name and is unique. Screenplay by David Magee is very good, dialogues are fine and they support movie very well. Screenplay has the typical essence of Hollywood. Everything has been plotted very well. First they shown the hurdle then use it afterward. Very realistic approach. Tiger is after all a tiger. Less of emotions and more of violence. Even they justify it in climax in very touching way. Credit must go to the director Mr. Ang Lee. There is good message beneath the entertainment that never ever lose hope. They touch the religion based God issue in very light but sensible way. VFX is seamless. It is hard to differentiate between the real scene and VFX. Now with the help of VFX it is possible to show the impossible. Performance wise the young PI, played by Suraj Sharma is very good. Irrfan Khan and Tabu are fine. Adil Hussain as PI father is also good. After all watch at least once.

LIFE OF PI is an odyssey that has everything: love, danger, exotic locations, swimming with tigers, and the three major world religions. It is a staggering, nearly all-encompassing metaphor for life. It will strengthen your faith in God. And it is infused with beauty throughout, via director Ang Leeahhh.I think there are two ways you could take the story: first, as a kind of magical tall tale; second, as something quite a bit deeper--i.e., not superficial entertainment, but profound testimony by an overcomer in life. I'm guessing that people who are deep and have been through a lot of difficulties in their lives will probably get much more out of this movie, whereas others might not relate to or perhaps even recognize the subtext in it (and oh, how much they will miss!!!).It isn't necessary to read the book first, although it is marvelously well written. Rarely do I think a movie so good that I see it twice in 2 days, and I will go see it a third time soon--don't miss it on the big screen!!MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

With all the hype of a bestseller novel turning into a 3D movie, Life of Pi would possibly be the highly overrated movie of the year. Of course, it greatly impresses with its verisimilitude of the digital imagery, which is painstakingly constructed with one step on the fantasy and another on reality. I think this is so far the best imagery shot/created for a oceanic film and Richard Parker, the tiger is a marvel. Though, I was initially disappointed with the narrower aspect ratio 1.85:1; would've been more spectacular in 2.35:1But, where the movie (and the Novel) falls in its entirety is the drama, which is said to be constructed in tangence to spiritual overtones which justifies the Indian milieu ; the so called philosophy it offers is so very juvenile and text-bookish, (at-least that's how it would be for an Indian); the characters so flat and sketchy and casting over the top, detailing really bad and the authenticity in the soup (Tamil Talkie parts especially). Wondering if they hired a (right) cultural consultant. And this makes the first 25 minutes terrible to watch. Yes, all this is supposed to be carried from the original content by Yann Martel (which I consider an Yawn inducer).Having read the book and unimpressed, my only reason to watch Life of Pi in cinemas was Ang Lee. The man, in one of his interviews has said, he did have an initial hesitation and did contemplate a lot before taking up this project. I think one has to follow their intuition in creative matters and wish Ang Lee did that.So, if you've read the book, you know what to expect plot wise, and you'd be anticipating Ang Lee's visual interpretation, which is sure to enthrall you. And if you have not read the book, even better, the anticipation of 'where is this leading' might keep you engaged; only that at the end when the destination arrives, you might be left unsatisfied. 5/10 for the visual magnificence.

Astounding movie experience!! Gripping story line that keeps you involved, and at the same time is simple and thought provoking. You start becoming / living the life of Pi as the film progresses and that is the real achievement of the movie. You are not a passive movie audience anymore.Most of you may not be aware, but "Life of Pi" is loosely based on the TRUE STORY of a person who survived a shipwreck along with a Jaguar. Yann Martel's 2001 Book "Life of Pi" on which the movie is based upon was in-turn based on Moacyr Scliar's 1981 novella "Max and the Cats", which in-turn was based on a true story.The quality of the 3D graphics are so real that few scenes may scare the children, but this is too good a movie to skip just because of this fact. Watch it, and then watch it again. This movie may well end up becoming one of your Top10 movies of all time.Simply great!! Two thumbs and two toes up :-)

I saw this movie in Bangalore in an IMAX theatre on a first show. I have watched other famous films from Ang Lee such as Crouching tiger. I had not read the book before but heard a lot about it. It was a very fresh experience for me without much expectations. The Indian setting is very beautifully captured and the storyline is compelling. The IMAX experience in 3D was the best I have seen so far. I usually hate 3D movies, but this one was exceptional. Visual narratives, imagination and the power of ideas with really sensitive photography has made this movie a master piece. I usually do not write reviews, but this movie has made me write one. That's all about it.

Having read the book in sleep mode was very curious to see the adaptation to understand the journey. Well ! Primary interest that drove me to theater was Ang Lee, Tamil, Indian connection specially South Indian and to find God. To talk about the technicalities of the movie which I can't talk cause I know nothing about it then let me talk like a commoner about it "It was Spectacular". Title card goes along with a Tamil melody undoubtedly I was excited to see. There were moments and there were dialogues which evoked me to think it over and made me miss the next scenes some are "Hunger will spoil the opinion you have on yourself or Unceremonial separation or May be life is all about letting it go" all lingered in my mind even after coming out. It all starts with the writer's curiosity, I heard that you have a story that will make me believe in God. Story goes on and emotion transcends and it all ends with Irfan asking the writer which one do you prefer? Writer Says : The Tiger one. Irfan says : Same goes with god. I know you are not understanding what I'm trying to say, may be life is all about letting it go, you can even let this review go if bored but don't let the movie go from your heart cause it'll teach you something. Some say this is going to be the Oscar winner of 2012, it may or mayn't but truly a heart winner. Join the journey !! - Prasanth Baligar

movie is great no doubt but story is not strong. If you watch this movie for special effect than you can give this movie 10 out of 10. Start and end of the movie is boring for the 5- 10 minutes. All over movie with splendid special effect it become great movie.If you are animal channel lover you really like his movie. In whole movie hero try to survive in the sea with tiger all alone. Then there is strange island come with many meerkat nice to see that island totally special in this movie. But most of the special effect are already shown in the promo of the movie. So, great movie must watch movie at least once you must watch.

This is an excellent film, beautifully done,beautiful cinematography and the digital scenes were seamless. I want to see it again for those reasons alone. The movie made you feel as though you were part of the story experiencing all the things Pi did and felt. Suraj Sharma, a 17 year old unknown, was the absolute right choice to play Pi he is wonderful. It made me wish for more young actors like him instead of the same cookie cutter no talents that the movie industry seems to feel the public wants. The decision to go with an international cast of unknowns to most of the world, for the most part(Gérard Depardieu has a small part as does Bollywood star Tabu...theirs were the only faces I recognized...) Go see it - with your kids - it is wonderful!

We just saw this movie yesterday and were amazed to see how it comes up to its hype. Perhaps the first time I have seen a movie based on a book I have read that didn't make me feel the director had left something out or (more often) falsified the story in some way. Remarkable discipline here, remarkable results. Perhaps the most wonderful aspect of this wonderful movie is the way the 3D, that much maligned technology is used to create effects that bolster the emotional weight of the story. There's no sense of having things thrown into your face, just to create the illusion of 3D. The illusion here is that it all looks very real, especially the presence of the ocean. There's sense of depth as well as of dimension. It should open the way for a lot of creative work in this medium.

This movie talks about how a individual, who loses his family in a ship accident, fights with unusual circumstances and survives the challenges posed to him. In this way he learns to see life in a brighter way and gets to know that hope is something that can win you anything. Suraj, the teenage Pi, was well suited for the role and certainly stole many hearts by his performance.The boat shots which were taken in the night were amazingly spectacular. And usage of 3D technology, especially when the ship wreck was sinking, was superbly shown. The screenplay is amazing, the background score is fantastic and the actors are well suited to their roles. All in all a perfectly made movie with excellent graphics embedded. Please don't miss this movie. Ang Lee was at his best!

Life Of Pi gave me very good lessons about Life..... It is film about Life,Friendship,God and Religion.The Film has very nice shots taken,its really a cinematic achievement.The shots taken of the ocean are completely unbelievable.I enjoyed through out the movie.Its not the movie to be enjoyed with popcorn,but a movie to learn something about life.3-D effects r not that good but the shots taken are awesome.The Ocean looks pretty good.Acting was throughout good in the movie,especially the kid Suraj Sharma,he did an amazing job in this movie.He is going to achieve a lot of things in his life.From this movie I a lot about relationship between animal and humans.This movie shows that animals too have souls,they too have a soft corner in their heart.Overall the movie is one the best in 2012.It might be the first 3-d movie to go through and win Oscar.Hats off to Ang Lee.He has given us a film something learn to.It will be another achievement for him,or it might give him the Oscar.But I gotta say its superb directorial achievement.

Ang Lee takes Yann Martel's much acclaimed novel and turns it into a collage full of masterful imagery and dream-like visuals, which remains at the core a profoundly simple tale of spirituality, in a manner which might leave you either with a wry smile and shake of head at what you just experienced or with a euphoric feeling equivalent to the one you get after seeing a magic trick. The thing with this magic however, is that it won't leave you for quite a long while and it might even make you question your most core beliefs. Or the lack of them.I don't believe in God but I do believe in the power of stories, imagery, art in it's most simple yet beautiful form and most of all in the power of words. I believe in the power of cinema, the moving images that can move you in more ways than you can imagine. That can transport you into another space and time, into a World full of possibilities. Of everything. Of nothing.And come to think of it believing in God may not be that much different.'Life Of Pi' is undoubtedly a cinematic achievement in terms of visual effects and images but it's real beauty lies in the story that is so simple in it's depiction yet so profound in it's impact.There are scenes of such wonderful amazement that words fall short often. Right from the beginning credits to the poignant scene when Pi leaves his lifeboat just after the ship-wreck and watches the mammoth ship sink underwater, the heart-pounding introduction of Richard Parker on the lifeboat, the surreal dream sequence of Pi, the many sunsets and nights at sea, the mesmerizing scene with the jellyfishes and blue whale and just so many other scenes that each one can be paused and made into a collection of brilliantly picturesque wallpapers. Such brilliant cinematic quality is very rare and it needs to be experienced on the hugest screen possible. It's why we go to the movies for. Ang Lee's direction is minimalistic and focused. Gentle and caressing. He does not make movies. He nurtures a baby and lets him out to play with us when he deems fit.The end is somewhat abrupt in it's flow but nevertheless compelling in it's effect. Suraj Sharma as Pi is very good. Tabu impresses in her short role and Aadil Hussain is effective. But like it's always in almost every movie that he does, it's the brilliant Irrfan Khan who etches out the older Pi with an absolutely touching performance. 'Life Of Pi' without any overstatement is a landmark achievement. It's a shining crown jewel in this oceanic, gigantic world of cinema. Something to be cherished and admired. And something that doesn't happen very often."I just told you two stories. Which one do you prefer?" "The one with the Tiger." "And so it is with God."I'm a believer. In something not very different from God I think.And yes, always "the one with the Tiger."

As someone who had not read the Life of Pi book, I really did not have any knowledge of this story or what to expect other than what I had seen in the trailer. It seemed like it would be an interesting enough tale and I was curious about what had transpired to bring a young man and a Bengal tiger together in a life boat. This was a spiritual journey that I was so thrilled to have experienced on the big screen. The entire story was filled with opposing ideologies beginning with Pi's discovery of religion. It was interesting that he was able to take a rational look at various religions and apply the teachings to his life that were beneficial, even life saving. The Life of Pi was profoundly engaging, I knew that Pi (Suraj Sharma) would survive the lost at sea ordeal, but none of the intensity of the story was diminished as a result of knowing the outcome. The imagery in this film was spectacular, from the opening scene credits I knew that I was in for a treat when a hummingbird was just inches from my face and literally within my reach. The scenes in which the ocean and the star filled sky seemed to merge into one were breathtaking. I made it a point to view this film in 3-D and it was worth every penny of the premium uplift, and we all know that not all 3-D films are. I'm not sure why anyone would mention Avatar and this film in the same context, although I just did because of the reference in the trailer, but other than the luminescent sea life, the two films have so little in common that it's like someone was reaching to describe the feeling that this story evokes. I love stories that showcase triumph of the human spirit as was the case with this one, but best of all you leave the theater feeling good about life in general, not guilty that your life has been average and happy, not shadowed by some tragedy that makes you evolve into a different person. The two stories told in this film that detailed what happened to Pi (Irrfan Khan) were opposites, I too preferred the one that featured Richard Parker. I was not a fan of the Cowboy story directed by Ang Lee, but am truly enamored by this Indian story, cowboys and Indians still dealing with opposites. This was a good story and I give it a green light.

Life of Pi is one of those films that you would think about leaving the theater and would stick with you for a long while. It has a lasting appeal, and a great ending that is not often seen in films these days as most film endings suck.It didn't start out strong though as we follow an older Pi telling his story to a journalist. He covers the younger years of his life, and if anyone has ever seen The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, you will know that his earlier years is fairly boring. We discover why his name is Pi, and its from a swimming pool. Okay. It isn't until he gets older where we finally see him on that boat and that big tidal wave hits, and the imagery is astounding. Pi is thrust into a lifeboat and this is really where our movie begins. Pi is trapped on a boat with animals: a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a fierce tiger. In fact, most of the movie is spent with Pi surviving hunger and not being eaten by this tiger in the middle of the ocean. What a great concept! It's also narrated by Pi, and its fantastic!If there is one complaint that I think most people would agree on is the use of very heavy CG. You can almost say there is too much CG and what is some beautiful cinematography. The tiger especially as it looks very good, but at times you can tell it was CG. You would notice this on a scene on a beach where the tiger is walking. The movement seems a little off and it ruins some of the realism on what could have been a very emotional scene.I can't recommend Life of Pi enough though. There's so many things I could say about it and it is a fantastic journey that if I saw it as a kid, it would be one of those movies I look back on and love even just for nostalgia sake. I'm seeing it again with my mom. This is one journey I think everyone should experience!

Life of Pi is stunning, beautiful, and philosophical with a tantalizing lack of absolute resolution. The movie is a visual masterpiece. I gasped at many of the images contained within it. (See it on a big screen.) I know the Pi contains a mix of digital artistry and live action, but, for the life of me, I could not see the seams between them.The only problem I had with the film was that I had difficulty understanding the accented English at times. This decreased as the story progresses and I grew more accustomed to the Indian cadence. Speaking of India, Life of Pi gives a vision of an India that I had never pictured.What I believed would be the ending of a bittersweet story was turned on end by a late twist artfully introduced to remove any hint of contrivance. It was impossible to have dry eyes by the end of Life of Pi, and the last few minutes of the film will have me thinking about it for months or years or maybe the rest of my life.This movie has my vote for best picture of the year as well as a half-dozen other awards.

First and foremost, I'd like to set the record straight. If you're one of those people who think "Life of Pi" is pretty much just a movie about a dude in a boat with a tiger, well, I have news for you......you're right.Ang Lee's latest feature, an adaptation of the book by Yann Martel which, after numerous attempts by other directors including M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Curon and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, was deemed "unfilmable," is indeed the story of a shipwrecked boy who survives for weeks on a lifeboat he shares with a Bengali tiger. As told to a reporter (Rafe Spall) by an adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) from his Montreal home (Canada REPRESENT!), the story starts off with Pi's childhood and religious awakening before spending much time at sea...on a boat...with a big cat.Religion is the overpowering theme of the film, there is no doubt, but not in a preachy sort of way. Rather than being some sort of moralistic tale, the point I believe the narrative is trying to make is that personal spirituality is important, no matter what you may believe, and we should all just respect each other's points of view. And although I am a non-believer, that is something I cannot fault. If only, right? When a young Pi finds an interest in Christianity after having been raised Hindu and discovering the Muslim religion, his father brilliantly exclaims "I'd rather you believe in something I do not agree with than accept all religions blindly." Excuse me if I am paraphrasing slightly there, but the line was very powerful and one I can respect a great deal.However, despite the lovely religious equilibrium and the cute ferocious animal, "Life of Pi" never quite managed to enrapture me. The filming style, with its cuts and edits, came across almost amateurish and TV_movie-like while I found the script slightly underwhelming and the performances merely acceptable. Nothing more.But who am I kidding...I did not see the movie for the story. What intrigued me about the film was the talk of the visual effects. THAT is what I went for. Having been heralded as the most visually captivating film since "Avatar," I was full of anticipation for this film for that reason and that reason only.And it is indeed a beautiful movie to watch on the largest screen possible. Definitely in 3D. The scenes are so incredibly drawn and meticulously brought to 3D life, you will almost forget what is going on in the film at times because you're busy staring too long at the CGI tiger going "wow, how did they do that?" Don't worry, it's not like you'll miss an important plot point. And you will find yourself asking that exact question many times during this film. However, it is no "Avatar," which remains the most visually magnificent film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing (although I am sure many of you will see elements which have been borrowed from it at certain moments). To be honest, I didn't even find it as visually captivating as "Cloud Atlas," as the beauty of the images hinder rather than help the audience personally connect with a story which seems a tad bit far-fetched as it is.No doubt Lee, a two-time Oscar nominee for "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Brokeback Mountain," for which he won, will undoubtedly get an invitation back to the ceremonies this year for his visual epic, but it's best chances at gold will be strictly technical, as the film itself leaves one a little underwhelmed. That time you spent the night with someone astonishingly beautiful but not terribly interesting? Yeah, kinda like that.

We have always been told that value of Pi is best calculated as 22/7 but you wouldn't know that 355/113 give a more accurate value of Pi than 22/7. However, using 22/7 makes it easier for to do calculations and that's the reason why it is used often.Done with beating around the bush... time to criticize!From the time movie start you can't help but notice the "beautiful" picturization and cinematography throughout. Add to that the life-like sound affects make you experience the movie almost in real time. This movie shows the wrath of ocean on its survivors and its destructive powers. There have been several movies made about survivors in wild or islands or the sea. This movie makes the survival journey even harder by making the human survive on a small rescue boat with a Royal Bengal Tiger. In my opinion, the presentation of this movie on the big screen was flawless. Plot revealed below.But you can never have a good movie experience until the actors "live the movie" and convince their audience that it all happened for real. Pi's role is taken by two people, Suraj Sharma when he was younger and Irfan Khan, the older Pi who narrates his life experience to a novel writer. Both have acted very well for their roles, but the role of honest looking younger-Pi seemed to make older Pi's role look a little weaker. During Pi's struggle to survive on a small boat with the fierce tiger, he realises a lot of things, most of it is self realization, the way he loses hope and regains it and the mysterious things he sees in his voyage makes the fictional story intriguing. What I liked about the movie was how Pi starts enjoying the little things he was left with in the rescue boat and how important it becomes for him. But, the most interesting part of the movie is how the boy and tiger learn to survive together and realize that each of them played a big part in keeping them alive.What makes a movie more unrealistic is a big negative for me. I didn't like extra affects that make the ocean look beautifully clear and magical. Another flaw in the story is the way it starts and the way it ends seem to have no connection. In the beginning Pi, as a younger kid seems to be furiously looking see the meaning of life, religion and God. By the end of it, I would have expected that the story would come with a clearer answer. The story makers somehow didn't make the ends meet.My suggestion: Pi is a good movie to experience. Watching it in 3D makes the movie experience even better.

Hands down one of the best visual films of, hell all time! I was pleasantly pleased with Skyfall and went to watch Life of Pi with modest expectations. The 3D itself was something inspiring but that wasn't the best part. The capturing of the sea, the perfection of each shot and the acting of both the boy and the tiger, all perfected what was indeed an unfilm-able fairy tale. But the best part was the ending. No not that ending. the very last one. I shall not divulge the secret because that would be a criminal offense. And no it isn't a twist of Himalayan proportions. Just a minute detail out of place and there you have it. Perfection and simplicity. In a deeply complicated theme. In one word, Brilliant.

For those who do not know, Life of Pi is a famous novel written by Yann Martel.As a person who has read the book, I have to say I am incredibly amazed at how accurate the movie was and how every little detail was incorporated in the novel. The 3d animations were extraordinary and it was just as I had imagined when I read the book. It was very realistic and the scenes were calming to the mind.The actors, where do I begin? Amazing just like how I remember them acting like in the book. I never really cry in films, but I did in this one. Very touching, very realistic and very exciting.I don't remember blinking or breathing at times threw the film. It's an exciting adventure that takes you threw the journey in the eyes of Pi Patel. Enjoy it!

Yesterday I took " A Journey of a Life Time " in theater to watch Life Of Pi. The movie is mind blowing, stunning and it includes many scenes portraying incredible and amazing and first-time- seen- in-your-life environments! The 3D just goes with it. The actors from the young to the eldest who portrayed Pi just did an outstanding job. The other actors including Adil Hussain, Tabu, etc. The Storyline is fabulous and makes you watch the movie without turning your neck! And of course a Fantastic directory from Ang Lee which makes the movie more special. I recommend Life of Pi to all of you reading this, STRONGLY! It's a MUST WATCH! 127 Epic minutes of your life! <3 My score 8/10

The trailers I saw for Life of Pi did nothing to explain what the movie was at all and I had not read the book nor heard of it. But I decided to give it a try. I don't like 3D, never have, it's always unimpressive. Well guess what? Ang Lee did it. I saw this in 3D and it literally is the first 3D film that made me go WOW!! The visuals are just absolutely amazing, some of the best effects I have ever seen. Fortunately this is not where the films ends it impressive streak. The story is just lovely, riveting, and so emotionally and spiritually deep. A philosophy class could talk about this movie for an entire year and still have more to say. The film doesn't even begin to try to give you a philosophy or way of life but rather is all about exploring the world and exploring the philosophies of life. As a lover of animals you will look for how all the animals in the film play a role but there are truly just animals and important lessons are learned through them. It was perhaps one of the most symbolic and deeply philosophical films I have ever seen and because of that it was incredibly entertaining and beautifully shot.While a few actors play Pi throughout various stages of his life, only one leaves an indelible and brilliant impression. Suraj Sharma at least deserves an Oscar nomination for making you feel so connected to him and displaying a brilliant display of courage and depth to his character. While he doesn't get as much screen time Irrfan Khan puts incredible emotion into his performance as adult Pi. Both Sharma and Khan bring to life a great adventurer and philosopher in the form of Pi. The supporting cast performs their parts perfectly. No one person really stands out because their goal it to get Pi into his adventure but they are still great. Adil Hussain and and Tabu are particularly good as Pi's parents.Ang Lee without a doubt must receive an Oscar nod for this film. The cinematography, the special effects, and most importantly the use of those special effects are nothing short of revolutionary. The animals are so brilliantly done and the character of the tiger (Richard Parker...love how he got his name too) is so vital to the entire story and by the time the film ends you will ache for the tiger as much as Pi does so you will feel his emotions. The film won't be for everyone. Certainly its just too intense for children with a lot of animal deaths and I can see the mainstream movie goers accusing it of being "slow" or "boring" but for anyone looking for something unique and outstanding, Life of Pi is it. I hope the critics feel the same way because this one is a home run in my books!! 9/10

LIFE OF PI - Directed by Ang Lee - 7/10This movie adaptation of the book gives an amazing visual treat. I preferred to watch it in 3D and I would recommend the same to everyone.Life of Pi is one of the movies that shows more promise than the book. Though the book gives exquisite details, the movie gives a more visual experience of those details.The direction is top notch. You can't expect any less from an Oscar winning director. Steady hands. Perfect angles. And the close up shots of our only Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger. You surely wouldn't want to miss that. Cinematography is perfect.Suraj Sharma as Pi Patel is a suitable find for the character. He surely can act. Perfect kick-start for his career. His rendezvous with Richard Parker and the chemistry between them is the factor that holds you to the movie.Irrfan Khan has a brief and supporting role. He couldn't have done any better that this.The background score is scene-oriented. Though the ambient sounds are incredible. Every detail of the sound has been looked out for.In the end, a satisfying experience of picture and sound. Its a story of belief. Its a story of faith.If you have read the book, don't miss out the movie. If you haven't, and the movie trailer interests you, then go for it.Go splash in the Pacific for an amazing adventure.

A silly dumb adventure that sails on sea for most part and left me with seasickness.At the end of the movie, I was hearing claps in the theatre and I was wondering what have they liked so much in the film because I did not like anything. Yes, the visual effects were good, but nowhere near a movie like JURASSIC PARK. Don't even compare with AVATAR please. The plot, oh, where is the plot, a boy gets lost in a sea because of a thunderstorm and he takes a trip with a tiger and for the good part of it, both are struck together in sea. The episode was too long for me and just made me feel like it's giving me seasickness. Now, where did it go wrong? If I may say so, then in the writing itself that does not involve audience much. That is, it did not do anything to me. It neither thrilled me nor moved me nor made me laugh out loud. It went on and on and got me drowsy by the end. The only good thing is special effects that are good, but I am sure many movies in recent past have come with better effects and better ideas. Hailed by many as one of the best films of this year, I would rather say, it's a boring adventure. It is good for the first half hour or even an hour I would say, but after that it goes on and on and the sad part is it has inevitable end. It's not a kind of movie that could have ended anyway, the adventure has to end and the boy has to grow and the big Pi (Irrfan Khan) is going to tell this to his friend. Hey, now there is a twist, he tells this adventure and he tells a believable story while normal people stick to his believable story, his writer friend likes the adventure. So I as audience, had to give in to something and I was rather interested in the story he told than this adventure. The best moments are done in the first half an hour itself with Pi and his family in Pondicherry, once he gets on a ship, and gets lost, it stays for sometime, but man, those jelly fish, those whales, even that royal Bengal tiger that was made in CGI did not help me liking it. So I disliked it to the core. Once, he said Richard Parker (Tiger) was gone at the end, I fell into sleep, I just couldn't take that. Damn, we had been there at the very night of a day (Night 11 PM show) and with all the pains taken, we see an adventure end just like that. It meant nothing for me, and I am going with a 1/5. This 1 rating is for the special effects and the gorgeous titles that were good but not great. Ang Lee, you squeezed me in to this film and you gave me a bad film so this is what I give you back, a negative review. I suppose I among the very few who are going to criticize this movie as most others are going gaga over this. It's okay; I have my own mind anyways.

Life of Pi 2012 | Rating: 4/5 | Genre: Adventure, DramaLife of Pi is filled with surprise, adventure, love and the nature of survival, along with the aesthetic narration of 'Ang Lee' who have Directed the film (sorry) Illustrated the film into a Paradise!.

Life of PI should be counted as a visual treat more than an emotional experience. Yet it should be considered as one the very good movies Hollywood has shown to the world in the past few years; where visual effects are dominating the screens.This entire story is about Faith and Hope. PI as a child was fascinated towards God, Rather restrict himself to one religion, He understood that ways of God might be different but destination in one. He accepts every thing good in every religion. He understood the concept of Faith in Hinduism and When He was introduced to Christianity; PI does not say Hinduism is wrong, He thanked Hindu God for introducing him with Jesus. The same positive approach was maintained throughout the movie in this character. When He was left alone in the ocean with Tiger, He says to God that he surrenders himself to him. That was truth. He surrenders himself to God and whatever comes in his way he went through it and took his life and way as God is taking him forward and his action is only to pass through the stages but not complaining or loosing hope. At one moment we believe in this where PI tries to survive, God tests him more in the form of Richard Parker (Bengal Tiger), Second Storm where he looses his total food supply, Prepared to be taken away by God (Death). Then God gives hope as a floating Carnivorous Island and again making him move forward without loosing hope.Richard Parker is a character rarely seen in movies. A silent villain character who makes the Hero survive. Imagine without Richard Parker, PI would have died in loneliness. As said in the movie, The terror of death from the Tiger kept PI alive. If Parker is another test by God, PI passed it by taming him. The relation between these two went very well through out the story when it started as predator and prey it transforms in to Master and Animal and finally hunger makes them both good friends in their own emotional levels. Though PI wanted Parker to look back and get his final greetings, Parker accepted them by stopping for a moment and leaving him alone without hunting down.Movie is visually astounding but visual beauty dominated the story? Certainly for an extent where there was not much story happening in the Ocean. It was lagging and on slow pace. Then comes the magical Island for rescue. But an immediate climax was a disaster for the movie. The way PI concluded the story before Japanese Cargo employees is good. But due to visual domination and partial drawbacks Life of PI just missed to be a Classic but almost there but worth watching once or twice. This movie cannot leave you in a trance where you go home and spend some hours thinking about it. Once you walk out of the theater the movie is over.

Life of Pi- a must watch It's quite apparent going by the trailers and the buzz generated by this movie that its all about a young man's survival from a terrible ship wreck and a certain Bengal Tiger ( named Richard Parker for mildly amusing reasons) during a storm in the Pacific Ocean. A middle aged Pi ( with a generous mop of curly hair , played by the subtle and extremely engaging Irrfan Khan) recounting his tale to a wide eyed Canadian novelist.The older Pi takes the novelist down memory lane and in the process paints a picture postcard of Puducherry, the zoo owned by his rational and strict father and his innate faith in godliness, religion whetted by his curiosity during the adolescent years. The parents had a different perspective on religion and spirituality – the father an atheist and the mother – mildly encouraging and endearing do not impede the young boy's religious intentions giving him the wherewithal to choose his own path.His life is not devoid of love as Pi in an understated manner states " We both had just enough time to break each other's heart" In due course of time due to the unstable financial and business climate post emergency, the father takes the stellar decision of migrating to Canada for a better future aided by the sale of zoo animals. Aboard the ship, nature plays spoilsport in form of a terrible thunderstorm leaving Pi the only human survivor with a ferocious tiger for company Picture this – it's just the boy and the Bengal tiger out there in the dark deep sea along with the forces of nature playing against him ( rain or shine plays true here) The Bengal tiger aka Richard Parker is an offshoot of digital imagery – the eyes, majestic walk, fur and the famous roar makes it all the more believable. This story is appealing as it deals with the problems Pi must solve which forms the most dramatic center piece of the film and you start identifying with Pi and the leap of faith he sorely needs. How in the middle of the ocean would he find food and water, avoid turning into Mr Parker's meal of the day, guts and gumption required to sale through this ordeal. The relationship he shares with Parker shows shades of fear, competition, predatory instincts, compassion and love with the director showing remarkable restraint and control in not following the predictable path.LOP's background score does not distract you, rather it plays a supporting role (the Tamil ditty at the beginning of the movie sung in a very soft and mellifluous voice) . The 3d visuals speak a language of their own (turquoise blue water, flying fish, dancing dolphins) aided by engaging story telling make it a visual spectacle Sooraj Sharma who plays the teen age Pi, is utterly believable as the character and you live and identify his trials and tribulations, while Irrfan Khan underplays the ordeal he has survived with an uncanny blend of normalcy. Adil and Tabu as Pi's parents in their own sublime way add a lot to the character of the boy who transforms into a man with a life changing experience The movie is one of a kind which is a visual marvel aided by wonderful storytelling , has profound lines , goose bump inducing moments and makes you believe in all the wondrous things and the avalanche of emotions the director has used to play with the human psyche be it Pi or us.It may also make you ponder and ramificate in the end whether you have seen anything at all :)p Love,Life,Luck and Laughter, Shekhar Vijayan.

I believe I have never seen a movie as picturesque and visually delightful as this one. It' a treat for the eyes, but that is just the tip of the iceberg, since this combined with the amazing coming of age story and good acting, dialogues makes this a great watch for everyone.The plot is nicely paced, maybe a little slow for some, but I feel that is necessary to hook one in and make the emotions portrayed feel true. However thanks to 'Richard Parker' there is also an element of thrill that keeps you on the edge time and again. These is a certain kind of purity to the story, but without compromising on subtlety and elegance. The scenes portrayed i.e. nighttime, sunsets, the lightning and storms, the exquisite variety of animals, underwater scenes; the rare but amazing quips and the beautiful analogy used as a 'proof of god' all on the whole left me strangely content when the movie ended, i.e. without the nagging need for 'more' that some good stories often leave behind.

If I could give "0" stars for this movie, I would. If you think you are going to a movie about a kid who survives a shipwreck and then makes friends with a tiger at sea, you will be very disappointed. If you love animals and it breaks your heart to see them hurt, then you will be sick to your stomach. There is not one single thing regarding the animals in this movie that is good to animals. I was horrified at what happens to animals in this movie. So, if you are not sensitive to the pain of animals, go see it. If you are, then this is your warning.The sad part of this is that the "regular guy" on the street, like me, will go to this movie. I cried through half of the movie because it made me sad. Movie critics go on about how great it is. They must be looking at it through eyes of the process, not the heart.In closing, some of the visual effects are amazing, but for how it made me feel when I left the theater, well,it's the worst movie I've ever seen.

LIFE OF PI (2012) **** Suraj Sharma, Irrfan Khan, Adil Hussain, Tabu, Rafe Spall, Gerard Depardieu, Sames Saito, Jun Naito. Ang Lee's masterful adaptation of the best selling novel by Yann Martel about a young man's survival of an ocean liner sinking castaway with only its other sole survivor, his family's zoo's Bengal tiger. Told in flashback with a few digressions about faith, religion, the human spirit and ultimately the meaning of life, this journey into one's soul is remarkably captured with impressive CGI (Richard Parker, the aforementioned fierce companion), gorgeously stunning cinematography by Claudio Miranda and a stripped down screenplay by David Magee propels the story with some amazing set pieces of nature unleashed as well as the inner voice we all share: what is my life REALLY about? Poignant, funny and ultimately life- affirming; a must see and the 3D is truly amazingly captured at full force.

This film is so beautiful to see, and the director's production so enthralling, that it rather grieves me to criticize the work, but that I'm compelled to do.The problem with this is that the adult Pi's interpretation of his adventures both confuses and undermines the narrative. He (and writer) are so committed to making this interpretation as vague and general as possible that it leaves one in limbo.Likewise such things as the "canivorous island" sequence dips into the fantasy idiom, which conflicts with its realistic content, making for muddled genre.Finally, in an effort to be inclusive regarding Pi's religious background, the writer chose to specify particular religions, thereby muddling the narrative's purity. It would have been better to dramatize the spirituality rather than specify it by naming names. This later limits the story's universality and further complicates the narrative's purpose.By keeping things as vague as possible, I'm sure many viewers think there's something deep here . . . something mystical and of a high plane. Actually I see it as a smoke screen for appearance sake and special effect.Still, the director's production is at such a high technical level that the film must be correctly be called "good."

When I read the book, I understood why Life of Pi was pronounced unfilmable. Most of the plot revolves around a boy and a tiger on a boat. This is one of those cases where most would say "nothing happens". This story which isn't blatantly cinematic didn't exactly have a formula for a great film. Its production was also jinxed as it changed directors from M. Night Shyamalan to Jean Pierre-Jeunet, an Indian-American and a Frenchman. These choices made sense since the book was written by a French-Canadian but set in the Indian backdrop. Finally, the job was handed over to Ang Lee who is neither French nor Indian. This told me how judgments could really throw you off sometimes and prevent you from discovering beauty. Lee takes on this crouching tiger and truly gives us a hidden dragon. He has always been expert at subtle drama and handling unspoken/ unfulfilled relationships with poignancy. It all ultimately fits. I would even go as far as saying the book was waiting to be filmed by him. Nobody else could have made it.Visually, the film is unlike anything your eyes have seen before. It is just utterly magnificent. Avatar, Hugo, Tintin and now Life of Pi. Few films have exhibited actual use 3D and not thanklessly indulge in shoddy gimmickry. The images composed are so strikingly rich and alive that it would work even without 3D. There would be at least 10 instances where my mouth opened and I couldn't bring myself to let out a gasp since I was choked with amazement.As most fables do, they transport you into a fantastical world while being an allegory on life. I personally love the character of Pi. He is relentless, a child of god who never ceases to give up hope. There is another character you take home with you: Richard Parker, the Royal Bengal Tiger. He isn't a cute dog that everybody in the audience falls for but a fearsome presence like King Kong. There are other wondrous creatures like a bioluminescent whale, an island swarming with meerkats and flying dorados. Magic realism on film has never been this good.Suraj Sharma is soulful as Pi. I wouldn't be surprised if he goes onto become a Hollywood movie star like Freida Pinto. Although, the performance that blew me away was that of Irrfan Khan as the older Pi. In the scene where he talks about Richard Parker, two teardrops from his eyes moved me ever so deeply. The film will be getting several nominations at the Oscars, including the big ones. But if there is any justice in Hollywood (which there isn't, as we know), Irrfan Khan should be on his way to getting an Oscar nomination for supporting actor.Mychael Danna's music is simply unbelievable. He uses Indian flutes, French accordions along with classical western violins. Pi's Lullaby (in Tamil) is achingly beautiful and it is accompanied with a gorgeous credits sequence that will make A. R. Rahman sit up with envy.I was a bit concerned about a few sub-plots in the novel and especially the preface which deals with Yann Martel talking about how he came to write this story. This preface is now a sub-plot in the film as Pi gives the story to the writer and tells him to do whatever he wants with it. That writer is Ang Lee who has taken Martel's story and improved upon it. He squeezes out certain moments from the source material and gives it a new life. The ending of the film is classic Ang Lee and stands tall as one of his best closing moments alongside Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Lust, Caution (2007). It is safe to say he is one of those few filmmakers who can film any story of any genre and still make it better than the genre's luminaries. He is one of cinema's modern masters.The question everybody will come out with after watching the film is whether it was real or not? I don't wish to go into this at all as I wholeheartedly believe Pi's tale without a single speck of doubt (I find it easier to believe than many films based on true stories). It isn't exactly believable how Sense and Sensibility, a Jane Austen novel that was fundamentally British was also perfectly filmed, not by a Briton, but by a Taiwanese filmmaker. It may seem far-fetched but it's the truth. Truth cannot be truth if it only comes out of knowledge and not experience. Life of Pi is that transcendental experience. There are many who will have issues with the film's thematic elements. Believe in god or not, but if you believe in cinema, you will surely be blessed with a gift. The word I would use to concisely describe Life of Pi is: "beautiful". This is most definitely one of my most favorite films of the year.

*Minor Spoilers*Advertised and rumored as the most spectacularly visually stunning & galling film till date, Ang Lee's film set right in the center of Pacific is a technically avant-grade production. Some of the visuals enraptured me so badly. And no doubt the film's towering accomplishments have been praised by none other than James Cameron.Technical excellence if flaunted throughout, but that's just not it; It's more. In the underbelly of the film lies an emotionally captivating story that is felt and experienced rather than viewed. The sense of being left alone in the world, with a boat and only a boat at stake, among wild animals that fight and outlive each other, these feelings come alive on the screen. One cannot stop feeling as stuck in the middle of nowhere as the protagonist does. We make the happenings our own.The impact is only exalted by the engaging cinematography and the very diverse background score. Mychael Danna was introduced to India on a wide scale with the Golden Lion winning "Monsoon Wedding" and has hence reaffirmed himself with the brilliant "Water", a score that make perfect use of western and Indian instruments. It is hard to believe it was composed by someone who lived outside India all through. "Life of Pi" is equally superb with the flute interludes standing out.Ang Lee's direction needs no introduction and praise. It is glorious, marvelous, matchlessput any synonym or even a hyponym in its place and it fits sound. Although he might not be as lucky as he was during Brokeback Mountain to win the Oscar. I love the way he doesn't compromise with the scenes and their treatment; He squeezes everything out of them on screen. The scenes are endless at times that one wonders why he pays such critical attention to every detail. It is overwhelming. Is the film self-indulgent? Yes I would say but in a good sense.Yann Martel's story is exquisite (though I haven't read the novel which I am keen to read soon) but it is the screenplay that is haphazard at places. It must have been problems with adapting a book. Lee can of course not always get a screenplay as good as the one by Emma Thompson for "Sense and Sensibility". But that doesn't hamper the experience much as the other wonderful aspects make up for it and it could be by far the best adaptation of a highly visionary and whimsical novel.Tabu has a strong screen presence and given the small role, yet she makes a long lasting impression. In her second international project after "The Namesake", Tabu makes the best out of the limited opportunity she gets. Adil Hussain is competent aside a dominating actor. Irfan Khan as the narrator & the older Pi is also refreshing. Suraj Sharma is an inexperienced actor but that never shows. Lee has made a perfect casting decision and the last scene in the hospital proves exactly why. Suraj Sharma looks at the camera that never cuts telling his "story" and we mostly experience the scene through his eyes that he expresses most of the story through.I also loved the way India was depicted in the film. Pondicherry was an intelligent choice in the first place. It gets rid of clichés and instead shows some of the beautiful things of India. Two particular scenes I enjoyed the most were the dance scene where the teacher sings the classical dance notes and the second where Tabu narrates the story of Yashoda seeing the universe in Krishna's mouth in Tamil. Life of Pi questions ideologies towards the end. It talks of reality that is difficult to assimilate, imagination that doesn't go beyond knowledge, a story that is seemingly imaginary yet claimed real. It tries to convince a character about the existence of God, structures a character as God-like and affirms faith and hope as the driving forces of human existence. The story has dark, ambiguous tones towards the end with which it questions what was 'right' and what was 'real'. It uses imagination as an escape medium for the protagonist.Despite all this, the treatment and the film as a whole is light, gives a typical happy end to the protagonist, hilarious at times, triumphs in the end unlike Lee's two previous films "Brokeback Mountain" and "Lust, Caution". Now that's what Lee's known for – directing films of diverse range and genre.

If you liked torturing animals as a kid then this movie is for you. For the rest of us that do not have sadistic tendencies, I did not care for this movie. I hunt and fish, and I have had to put down some of my own horses. If I don't get a clean shot when hunting I put the animal out of its misery. I found the advertising for this movie totally misleading. It is not about a boy on a lifeboat with a tiger. That is what all of the pictures show. I can't imagine spending time reading the novel that this film is based on. The $10.50 and 2.5 hours i spent viewing this movie were not worth it. The movie is rated PG, but it is not something you would want to take your younger children to.

Beautifully made movie about the complex relationship between Good and Evil, Man and God. The only negative is that the movie is so visually stunning that it may lead the viewer to appreciate it only on the physical concrete plane. The real point to the movie is to show us that the tiger is not in the boat trying to kill the boy, rather that there is a metaphorical tiger living in each of us, and it is through the mythology of religions that each of us may discover for ourselves how we deal with our own tiger. In this way, I think that the medium of film cannot match the impact of the written text for a film of such metaphoric import. It is through the imagery created in each individual's mind through the living life experiences of each person reading the passages of the book that give it deeper personal meaning and sense to the metaphor. This movie, as every movie, must impart the visions and experiences of essentially one person, the director. But it is such a beautiful vision after all.Thumbs up!

I could write several pages about this movie, but I decided to give the reader a short take. A breathtaking and well acted, well directed masterpieceMr . Lee takes us beyond a world only imagined in a dream. The execution of the 3D was the best.Oscar night will have a few nominations, but this one, by far, will be a winner in many categories...The night scenes were the most beautiful.The Tiger's realism was out of this world.The story unfolded many spiritual layers for me.

Life of Pi...The Best ever 3D graphics seen by me in any movie. awesome!! You will be mesmerize by the beauty and cruelty of Sea and storms.. Once again 'Ang Lee' proves that he he is a master story teller... More than the actor 'Life of Pi' belongs to its director Ang Lee. He has used the locations as well as technology to his best advantage. It is hard to imagine such a difficult storyline is being conceptualized and materialized into a full fledged movie with such precision and success. Full credit goes to the cast and crew of the movie. Irrfan Khan is very classy in his short role. The lead actor has done a commendable job. He is surely a young talent to look forward to. Tabbu is effervescent as always. Everybody has contributed their part in making 'Life of Pi' a must watch for everyone.The story itself leaves you with a question..What was Real??????????????????????????

Kudos to Ang Lee ! Must watch movie Life of Pi.3D was mesmerizing and cinematography was too good. Certainly a change in 3D movie industry.Suraj Sharma was brilliant as Pi. He can make happy scenes as equal as sad, desperate, hopelessness, exhaustion and anger ones. Very few movies allow an actor represent so many emotions.Irrfan Khan as the older Pi contributes largely in making the film emotionally compelling. American accent is a bit noticeable but overall good enough.Better watch it only in 3D theater, will blow you up. Animated character of tiger doesn't allow you to feel that it is animated, it was so real.

Director Ang Lee has done a great job in the ancient art of storytelling. This story of survival of the fittest at sea is visually beautiful although there are scenes that can be a bit disturbing. The story is being told by the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) to a down and out writer (Rafe Spall) who is looking for material for a new book. The film does an excellent job of explaining how Pi got his name and how the lessons of his father helps him to cope with the difficulties that he is about to encounter. I think that the incorporation of religion also added some depth to this film by surmising that religion is not as important as spirituality. Pi (Suraj Sharma), a zebra, hyena, orangutan and a Bengal Tiger (affectionately named Richard Parker) are the survivors of an unexplained shipwreck. From that point on Pi has to figure out a way to stay alive, not just from the animals, but also from Mother Nature herself. I can tell you right now that if it was me on the boat I probably wouldn't have lasted a day. But I guess you never know what you might do when presented with extenuating circumstances. I was not really familiar with any of the actors in this film except Gerard Depardieu who played the cook. Now that I think about it, he was a cook in the last film that I saw him in (Last Holiday with Queen Latifah). Apparently this film was based on a book that no one thought could possibly be made into a film; I guess they were wrong. The mere idea of moving a zoo from one continent to another is pretty mind boggling in itself. I do have to say that the CGI in this film was amazing and took computer imagery to a whole new level, but I would not expect anything less from Lee. I especially liked the scenes in the ocean and the events on the mysterious island. Although this film had a "G" rating, I am not sure if it would be appropriate for very small children but I enjoyed this film very much. I do want to add that the minor plot twist at the end kind of makes you wonder what to believe. There is no need for a life jacket for this one. I am giving the film a green light.

Warning: Don't take your children to see this movie! The cute and beautiful trailer is very deceiving!The true story is gruesome and horrible even for adults. After a shipwreck, a religious boy had to eat the flesh of crews and even his own mother. The pragmatic teachings from his father urged him to survive at anything, while the religious teachings from his mother helped him to imagine an alter ego (the Tiger) to deceive and pacify himself.Adult Pi suffers from Post-traumatic syndrome. His face shows little emotional expression, typical of PTSD. He can only numb himself and come to peace with the help of religion and family.Pi is religious because otherwise he would die or go crazy. The teaching of this movie is: Religion is the opium for the masses (Karl Marx). When President Obama wrote to Ang Lee saying: 'an elegant proof of God', he did not understand this movie...... So did so many moviegoers......

this story will make you believe in God, is the tall claim made early in this movie. does it go on and do that is another question. The film contains stunning and beautiful visuals as well as good performances by the actors. The movie as a whole fails to be a more than the sum of its parts. I liked it for its visual imagery and only its visual imagery. The story fails to grip, inspire, force you to think etc. Even the adventure in itself does not really look like and adventure but a boring ordeal. At the end of it we are left with a fantastic but a boring story which while presented in a visually appealing way, leaves you questioning, what the fuss was all about.

Visually, this movie is a knockout. Scene after scene produces audible gasps as we see images we never thought possible. The colors just pop off the screen, the various animals shown are incredibly realistic, and the views of sky and sea are just phenomenal. Even if there was no plot whatsoever, you should see it just for the visuals.There is a plot, of course. A boy/young man is stranded on a lifeboat and is forced to survive for endless days through unbelievable hardships. And if that alone were the plot, I'd be content, but the framework around the shipwreck story claims something more, that this story says something about the human condition, about God and man, about sin and salvation, about how we should live our lives. My problem quite frankly is that I just did not see the connection. Maybe I need it told more directly, I certainly have a low tolerance for ambiguity. So if you can live with agonizingly uncertain outcomes, where you question everything you have just seen, then you will love this. But if you like things told to you clearly, you may walk away a bit puzzled, as I did.But regardless, this movie redefines the word "beautiful." I was just amazed to see the many, many moods of the ocean as it is portrayed, in fact it becomes one of the primary characters as it is sometimes benevolent, sometimes treacherous; calm or stormy; gray or overflowing with color; etc.

Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' begins with a delightful opening scene in a zoo with various animals and a melodious song playing the background. The rest of the film is also replete with fascinating scenes, but somewhere the connect is missing.Narrated in flashback mode, it's the story of Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma when young and Irrfan when grown up), a man who is a Hindu, a Muslim, a Christian and who also teaches other religions. He is the lone survivor of a sea disaster in which he also loses his family. Now on a small boat in a vast ocean, he has to survive. And to give him company is none other than a deadly Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.'Life of Pi' is a visual treat. There are no two ways about it. There are many scenes which will mesmerize you like the scene in which blue lights are lit in the ocean and when the ship is hit by a storm. Alas, beautiful scenes alone don't make a wonderful film.It has the right intentions but lacks the soul to be a great film. There are many things the film wants to say (like not losing hope), but they aren't narrated meritoriously. You feel underwhelmed as you don't really relate with the main character. And it also drags in portions.Suraj Sharma delivers an inspiring performance. He handles his character with great poise. Irrfan is perfect. Watch out for the scene in which he breaks down. Tabu is good in her small role. But perhaps the biggest star of the film is the tiger. The relationship which he shares with Suraj Sharma is endearing. The cinematography is spotless and the editing of the film is swift with some wonderful transitions.'Life of Pi' isn't full of life. Watch it for the visual experience, if you must.

This is not just a movie. Its a superlative piece of art moving on the screen. From the start credits to the end credits everything is just purely stunning. I have read the book few months ago and was eagerly waiting for this movie as the novel was a stupendous work in itself. But I was also nervous that the movie might not actually be as upto the mark as the novel, as the story is totally one of its kind. But MY MY..The movie without diverting a bit from the novel(except the lightning whale scene) has captured every bit of the book and by creating a visual masterpiece Mr Ang Lee has even surpassed the effect the novel had on myself. I watched it last night and even after a long night of sleep the movie still is not out of me yet. Watch it if you haven't already, and if you have then watch it again, as most of you from the later category would agree that it's worth a second watch in the theater. Also please watch it in 3D only. I haven't seen a better 3D movie except Avatar and Kung-Fu-Panda-2. Watch it otherwise you won't even know what you missed and that will be a real pity...

For me,The very aspect of an good cinema is its emotional quotient,the story,cinematography,and last but not least ,the direction..very few films reach a certain level but this film completely surpass it..every aspect of this film is outstanding. the film is intriguing and has lot of substance.i loved the other aspect,that the movie"S background is Indian but the director worked hard for making its global appeal visible and no doubt he succeeded in it. completely forgot myself in that process and enjoyed the journey of this young boy..haven't read the book but i hope the film is on par levels of the print medium.Thanking the screenplay writer,novelist and the director of this epic.

I am not completely sure what to think of Life of Pi. Certainly, the majority of my thoughts equal a thumbs up. But when all said and done, it seemed...hard to pin down.Pros: Almost everything; Directing, writing, casting, acting, music, cinematography, and most especially incredible, unique visual imagery and artistically gratifying use of 3D.Cons: There is long one shot scene near the end that felt like it scrubbed a lot of the story's momentum, and put more questions in my mind as to what was really supposed to have been going on. That may be the intended effect, but I found it more confusing than intriguing or thought-provoking. Also, like several other films that I have seen this year, the "main idea" is not nearly as well fleshed-out as it aims to be. What is this story really about?Overall: Life of Pi contains some of the most gorgeous, overwhelmingly magical, otherworldy visuals that I have ever seen, and it is the first time that I have enjoyed watching a film with 3D glasses on. (All others that I have seen in 3D, which granted did not include Avatar, struck me as cheap, artistically bankrupt gimmicks - but not this one.) It is worth the price of admission for that alone. And there are plenty of other reasons to see it, which I will not spoil. Ang Lee is, for my money, one of the best directors out there, and this film most definitely does not fall into any "lowest common denominator" category. It is something special.Is it a masterpiece as a whole? I am not willing to go quite that far. Avatar has a more concise story, and that counts a great deal to me. However, Life of Pi is arguably the more genuinely intriguing of the two. I would recommend it.

Its hard to believe that a novel as complicated and widely regarded as "unfilmable" has finally been brought to screen and that too by none other than Ang lee. Saw this movie last evening and the vfx couldn't leave my mind even after coming out of theatre. The movie is beautifully picturised and storytelling is magnificent. The actors are brilliant, irrfan is as soothing to eyes as ever and creates the calmness which he often brings to screen. Suraj sharma's vulnerability creates relativity with the viewer and emotional connect becomes apparent. The most brilliant thing in the movie is Richard parker( for people who haven't seen the movie yet or read the novel, its the Bengal tiger!!). The tiger creates a connect which strikes the chord more than even pi does himself which is strange yet true. The movie was a delight to eyes and quite moving too... I strongly recommend to see this fine piece of art visualized on screen.

I often try to use the movie name or something about it as part of my blog title. However, nothing short of 'spell-binding' does justice to this one. Ang Lee brings to life practically the impossible – a supposedly unfilmable book is presented in a manner that is a treat for the senses making Life of Pi a must-watch all the way!! Life of Pi starts off slow and after a time you begin wondering where's all the water, animals and action you saw in the trailer - but patience bears fruit. Once the adventure begins you are completely swept away and by the time the film reaches its abrupt intermission (since there's really no intermission in a Hollywood movie) you are well entrenched in the adventure and in no mood for a break. There's a lot of talk about the 3D of Life of Pi being better than Avatar. I'd just say that Life of Pi is presented in 3D in an Avatar of its own, the kind that perfectly suits the story that is told. The 3D isn't as extravagant, but peaks up at exactly the right moments and some scenes are sure to give you the thrills you would seek from a 3D movie. Clearly some lessons for all and sundry on how to use 3D in a movie However, while its a visual spectacle, Life of Pi is a real winner more because of the kind of depth its storyline offers. On the face of it, its an adventure, a tale of courage, hope and survival all very well but peel the layers and you find profound depth and meaning to everything you've witnessed in an entirely different light. I myself believe that I have only scratched the surface of what Life of Pi has to offer apart from its visual treat and best of all the director doesn't push you to think in any given direction. Its for you to think, explore and ponder or not The performances are top notch too, Suraj Sharma the protagonist does a decent job and pulls off a difficult role. The treatment to his character and his visual appearance is thoughtful and consistent, making his unbelievable story come to life. Irrfan Khan delivers yet again and though his initial accent is a little unbecoming, his emotional delivery later in the movie takes the cake. So does Adil Hussain impress with his impeccable accent and delivery in the earlier part of the movie. The only one wasted, is Tabu who given her range of performance is given a rather simple and short role The real star of the show is however, Ang Lee – first for believing that such a movie was possible and secondly for presenting it so wondrously - with scenes shot under and over water, at close quarters with a royal Bengal tiger and a host of other superb sequences. After one has almost given up here comes a real winner. One should never lose hope..so is the case with God, and Hollywood too I guess ;)To read my reviews on other movies check out my blog at http://www.anitalks.blogspot.com

There are a lot of positive and admirable things about Ang Lee's latest Life of Pi. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda captures the most uproarious and glorious shots captured this year thus far. The 3D effects are some of the best ever seen and feels absolutely necessary in a film so heavy handed with religious tones. What Mychael Danna achieves in Lee's film has just placed him in the forefront of great film composers working today. He continues to impress with his musical range, envelopes the film's message and thematic narrative in somber and beautiful melodic notes. On Visual Effects alone, Life of Pi will likely land a nomination for Best Picture. What Lee invents with the ocean and the integration of the tiger and the other animals is spectacular. He allows the mood of the film and the imagery to marry each other in a ceremonial experience that stands next to Sci-Fi epics like Avatar (2009) and Hugo (2011).Newcomer Suraj Sharma puts a valiant effort in the role of "Pi," a performance that may land him more critical and impressive roles in the future. The work is reminiscent of great breakthrough performers like Rudy Youngblood (Apocalypto, 2006) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire, 2008); both were impressive turns but sadly will not catch any awards attention. Irrfan Kahn, who has delivered in great supporting turns like The Namesake (2006) and A Mighty Heart (2007), could have his best chance ever for serious awards attention. His hurdle will be a minimal screen presence and a supporting actor race that's crowded with "movie stars."

Hi, Today, I watched 3D movie and theater was house , you will get fresh look with first half the movie but second half seems very slow as compare to first. Second half was so boring, sometime i felt movie should stop but its continues, i was expecting some kind of message at the end of movie but it end without any message .I was expecting more than director lee delivered but sometime expectation kills your expectation ;) I liked role which played by young boy pi it was amazing. So all and all don't keep higher expectation from movie, just go and watch you will really enjoyed.Thanks Amber

An Indian Teenager named Pi is lost at sea, on a life boat, with a man hungry tiger named Richard Parker. Pi does what it takes to survive, while trying not to be eaten. Will Pi keep his faith, and make it through this ordeal? Ang Lees direction is brilliant, so was the teenager playing Pi. The movie makes you feel that your lost at sea with the character. And the tiger is also good, I'm wondering what parts CGI. Although it does drag in spots, too the point where I was dozing a little, but it then it picks up. I think this is the best film of 2012, I hope it won't be missed by the Oscars. If they do miss it, well it's there loss.

*When: 7:20, 25th Nov. 2012 *Where: Maichilai, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.*How: Driving to theater. After exercising.*Why: Ann Lee create a film which is echoed well from the critics. although I didn't successfully join the Taiwan Mobile VIP due to seats too much near screen for my Mom, I decided to go to see it and share with Janet.*Whom: Myself.*What: Despite of the confusion about which one of the stories is true eventually, there are some deep meanings inside of the film. The father next to me was yawning in some quiet scene. Maybe he's still figure out the essence of it. The great things I enjoy are the artistic design and natural arrangement of 3D. The core idea delivered from this film is not only the will of survival but also a philosophy of life in an unknown adventure.*Conclusion: a great one for refreshing.

Life of Pi is an amazing allegory, that attempts to explain a very abstract concept. This will no doubt confuse many, because it touches on the heart of how we perceive our own spiritual beliefs, it challenges our ideas of religion, the things we have held onto since childhood to give us hope and inspiration. Many people will leave the theater thrilled by a story of a boy who is trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger and how they formed a bond that saved them both. The film is vividly colorful, exciting and haunting, masterfully directed by Ang Lee. But, just as we think we've had a rollicking good time with a fantastical story, the last part of the film comes at us, and shakes us up. This is the crucial part of the film, and if audiences choose to ignore this, they miss the entire message of the film. As Jung said "Man must have his myths". So it is with God, so it is with Life of Pi.

"Life of Pi is a movie with some stunning images but it fails to reach the spiritual entente it is trying to tell the audience" Based on the Yann Martel novel of the same name Life of Pi tells the story of two characters who have to learn to get along in order to live. Adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) tells the story of his younger self (Suraj Sharma) when his family sold their zoo in India causing them to move. During the boar journey in sinks leaving Pi alone losing his family. He does not end up alone because a couple of animals join him and most promptly is a tiger called Richard Parker. The two start off conflicting but go through a horrible ordeal that brings the two closer together as they must work close in order to live and return to some sort of home.Ang Lee is probably the most versatile director working today because he can direct a film about Karate fighters, Gay Cowboys and Hulk. This new film is mainly set in the ocean after spending some time in India introducing us to Pi and how he ended up where he is. Since most of the film is set on a boat and life raft not much dialogue is spoken except for a voice-over from Pi as he explains how he survives and deals with this viscous animal. Lee has made this simple boring story more interesting by providing some thrilling images as the characters go through there adventure. An example of this is the use of bright luminous colours which can either be seen as too distracting or fitting to the story and some of the images shown to me worked while others were to jarring and took away some of the enjoyment. The way this tiger was filmed is very sharp CGI because i was not thinking about whether the tiger was real or not and that shows the talent Lee has to make reality and fantasy blend into one great visual.First time actor Suraj Sharma plays the main character Pi and this is his first screen performance and acting overall. He brings life to Pi but his performance seems to forced at times and I blame that on his lack of experience acting in general. He can be great at times but for most of the film I was not into his acting. Irrfan Khan plays the older Pi is few scenes as he sets up this story he went through as a young boy. He is just OK because he is not really emotive compared to Suraj and for most of his film is used as a link back to the journey story as he tells it to the writer who will be writing this story Pi went through.The film's story is the main problem because it is mostly placed in the middle of the ocean and taking the risk gives you the disadvantage of sometimes not presenting the best story you can give all the time. The bright colours and fascinating scenes Lee filmed kept my interest throughout but overall the film fails mostly because of the lack of talents it's main actor has as he acts opposite this mostly CGI tiger.MOVIE GRADE: C+ (Irrfan Khan)

This is a movie full of inspiration and human survival instincts along with ample dose of emotions and Pi's affection for the beautiful Bengal tiger.Although you want to believe that animals do have feelings but this movie correctly portrays that animals only have instincts not feelings.It also makes us sad to think that they may not feel the love we want them to feel and also do not reciprocate it.That is the saddest part of the movie for me...when Pi's expect some kind of gesture from the tiger but the tiger just disappears into the jungle.But then again we must also be happy since the true home of the tiger is the jungle and he is happiest there.Also this movie shows the amazing human brains and how Pi's uses different skills to survive.I do not want to reveal the entire story but this is A must watch for every person of every age.

I was lucky enough to see this Incredibly Visual Treat movie in 3D.Life of Pi is surprised me a lot though i had some expectation before but trust me i witnessed One of the Best Experience in My Life.Story is more about a Survival of life and its more about faith in god.Why it is highly Recommended to Watch: Truly an Amazing Story with great adventures - Well Crafted movie - Hats off to Ang Lee - No Confusion from the Start to the End. If You know about cinema well or if you are a film maker you would notice many things in this movie which is just brilliant. Performance of Suraj Sharma (Pi) is was equally good with the Visuals. His body language towards the end was unbelievable. Special Effects of this movie is the Best of the lot. Some of the Scenes literally took my breath away. Richard Parker(Tiger) was terrific. Its introduction in the boat was the highlight of the movie. Undoubtedly My Favourite Character.It looked like a Real Tiger has shown its emotions throughout the movie. Great work by CG Life of Pie is an Honest Attempt and it is a World Class Cinema. Don't miss it !!! Happy To Share with You All !!!

The Angular tales are back with another Ang Lee feature. Director Lee is never timid in taking on a wide array of genres when tackling on a movie. And in his latest "Life of Pi" he might have just discovered a new genre for motion pictures because Pi serves such themes as adventure, love, courage, man vs. beast, family, religion, regret, friendship, survival, and a few others all in one just movie. "Life of Pi" is the most beautiful looking picture of the year, and it will have its Pi I mean eye on the Oscar prize of many technical categories including Best cinematography, sound effects, editing, special effects, and art direction. By the way, the 3-D in this picture is used to its apex. The movie features our protagonist Pi Patel first as an adult telling his incredible teen tale to a journalist, and then it rewinds to flashback in the telling of his unforgettable adventure at sea. Pi's real name is Piscine, so you could imagine how much he was bullied at school due to his name. His father named him Piscine because of his love of pools; but come on bro, out of all the pool of names you could have named your son, why that one? To avoid future name harassment, Pi during his teens, decided to shorten out his name to Pi; an incredible scene in the movie shows Pi in a 3.14 craze demonstrating to his classmates how the Pi equation is calculated in order for them to comprehend that he is now a Pi not a Piscine. Pi's parents live in India and own a farm. When economic problems arise, Pi's father decides to move teen Pi and the family from India to Canada. His plan is to sell the farm (literally) in Canada. To do this, he must first take the family and the animals on a freight ship at sea to Canada. And that is when "Life of Pi" transposes itself to a mystical "survival-at-sea" flick. A brutal storm causes a shipwreck which Pi bravely survives. Consequently, he is stranded on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. Yea, that happened to me also. Anyways, Director Lee carries the picture into a thrilling state of "young man vs. beast" for survival. And he brilliantly depicts the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker as the forefront on many of the film's messages about the aforementioned themes. Wait, I must take a break. My cat Douglas Simpson is hungry and I must feed him. OK, that's enough. David Magee's endearing screenplay also deserves an Oscar nod for its relative verbose within Lee's direction. And Ang is a shoe-in for a Best Director Oscar nomination, I must say. Another what should be a sure Oscar nomination is Newcomer Suri Sharma's mesmeric performance as the teen Pi. And Surily I can be serious! Veteran Indian actor Irrfan Khan was solid as the adult Pi, but the young Pi Sharma had the more tasty scenes for a thespian showcase. So without a doubt, on a scale from 1 to 4 (4 being excellent), "Life of Pi" is not a 4 but much better than a 3.14. ***** Excellent

Through a movie with minimum human interaction.. Ang Lee shows humanity in its purest form.Through the incredible co-survival of a man and a Bengal tiger, Life of Pi shows us how both hopes and fears keep us going.The visual is simply groundbreaking. For moments I almost thought I was hallucinating. Many of the scenes were shot Planet Earth (the most expensive nature documentary) style, but only more stunning, in 3D, and woven together by a strong character and a beautiful story.But visual effects is far from being the only thing that makes Life of Pi extraordinary. Life of Pi is such an all-round hit. Authentic and not over-the-top acting, smooth storytelling, engrossing score.. all in all it struck me as a masterpiece not only made by masters, but also with a heart.I couldn't be more glad to celebrate this as my 700th movie on IMDb. Hope, as is Life of Pi's tagline, is what it gives me. Can't wait for Ang Lee's next movie.

Before giving any review about the movie i must request everyone to watch this movie only in a 3D format because i feel it is one of the very few of the 3d movies which retains its soul despite being in 3d format and not being a mere sales technique. Life of Pi is not a story about survival as many of viewers who have and have not read the book mentioned it already. It is not a story about a cast away. It is much more than that. It is about faith, religion, endurance and most important of all relationships. I have not read the novel on which the movie is based but yet i can be pretty sure that the movie has done almost or complete justice to it. With no intentions of watching this movie i went in expecting nothing but came out thanking the ones who took me for this movie. Ang Lee has always had an incredible ability to depict human emotions in various ways and various characters which we have seen in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. But in this one he goes a step beyond and creates an emotion between a human and an animal. But it just doesn't end there, he adds the flavor of perfection to the movie by giving incredible visuals. Now being stranded on a sea can be a boring script especially when you have a run time of 145 minutes but Ang Lee shows us so much in that time that you end up craving for more. With exceptional visuals and incredible performance by the lead, Life of Pi is an unforgettable movie for me and it does make me believe in God. I am sure it will succeed in making a lot of other people believe. There are unforgettable moments in the movie and it is going to be extremely difficult for anyone to pick just one. But i am sure everyone will like the last ten minute of the movie which make you think and go through the movie again. I salute Ang Lee for such a beautiful depiction of the book and portraying so many beautiful things and putting the CGI and Animation to the right use. The movie is a pure piece of Art and must not be missed under any circumstances. I would really wish to see this movie in the IMDb top 250 list

How does one narrate a story like Life of Pi? And then, how does one make a movie out of it? Assuming you manage to pull it off somehow, how on earth do you find any scope for use of 3D in a movie that has no alien attacks, warring robots or swinging superheroes?Ang Lee delivers the answers to all these questions in spectacular fashion. I have read reviews comparing this movie with Avatar, and i feel it is an unfair comparison. Avatar was nothing more than a three- hour advertisement for 3D, whereas in Life of Pi, 3D becomes a part of the story itself, almost like a character in itself.The movie opens with debates on religion and spirituality, which might feel a little dull for Indian audiences, for whom these concepts are part and parcel of everyday life, but would fascinate Western audiences. Once the family of the protagonist, Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) sets sail for Canada, along with all the animals in their zoo which they plan to sell in Canada, it turns into a gripping drama. The ship sinks, and Pi finds himself adrift on a lifeboat, which he has to share with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan - and the star of the show, a Royal Bengal tiger called Richard Parker.The storm scenes are so realistic, and so superbly enhanced by 3D, that it would not be a bad idea to carry along seasickness bags into the movie hall. As we breeze through storms, shoals of bioluminescent fish, flying fish, exotic islands and so on - the technical prowess of the movie grips you with its brilliance. The screenplay and the camera-work, and above all, the CGI - the tiger is apparently a product of CGI - are all strong contenders for Academy awards. But the stronger point of the movie is not its technical details, but the emotional quotient. The entire drama is about the relationship between the tiger and Pi, which is among the most unusual relationships ever seen on the screen. Suraj Sharma delivers a memorable performance reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away. He showcases his remarkable ability to have you in splits with his comic timing, and at the same time moves you to tears. It's an extremely challenging role - of having to carry the entire movie on his shoulders - and Sharma does a stellar job.Towards the end, however, the movie sags down inexplicably, as if the director suddenly ran out of creative ideas and asked one of his understudies to complete the movie. Indeed, it is the last 20-odd minutes which caused me to rate it 7 rather than 9, but despite its shortcomings, Life of Pi remains a must-watch, and one of the favourites for Best Movie and Best Director awards.

Life of Pi – don't miss it! It's not just another 3D movie for kids and by the way, calling it a children's movie will be Life of Pi's biggest insult. Unlike other 3D movies, the director Ang Lee has used digital effects not only to entertain but also to explore the finer thread that binds together the human understanding of fate, faith, religion, and god. To that effect, he seems to have done an awesome job, which might as well win him a third Oscar nomination for the best achievement in directing. The 58 year old Taiwan borne director has won the award once before for the 2006 flick Brokeback Mountain. Acting is another strong point of the movie. Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan look profound and amazing. Their acting may ensure them more such fine performances in international cinema. All and all, a wonderful journey into the unknown and hence the unexpected!CAVEAT: In the last five minutes of the movie, Ang Lee tries to give a cerebral twist, which may make you yawn especially since it entirely lacks 3D special effects which until then drive the whole movie at breakneck pace.

I've used IMDb for 2 years and I created an account just now mainly to write a review about how disappointingly bad it was. It starts out quite promising, as though to deliver an insightful message about life, but the conclusion is absurdly ignorant about the nature of life, and especially human nature. OK, so IMDb tells me that I cannot submit my review unless its at least ten lines. Well, to tell you just how bad this movie was I am willing to keep writing. ...But I might even say positive things, because I think I've been negative enough already. The 3D visuals were pretty cool, though not comparable to the awesomeness of Avatar. OK, more negative. I have a feeling animals were harmed for the making of this movie, which is a deal-breaker for me. Oh, but the idea of the floating carnivorous island was pretty cool. In conclusion, I wish I could get my money back, and time

I watched this movie in Lucknow, Wave cinema at 10 40 PM show.It was 3D show and was priced at 150 , I would say it was my highest ROI film ever watched .And it was one of the most beautifully picturesqueness movie I have ever Seen.The movie was in 3D, the scenes were awesome, an angle of emotion,philosophy I would say it is must watch movie for everyone.It will lead to into entirely different world altogether.I am giving 8 , not 10 on 10 it lost somewhere, where in the end it doesn't do justice to the overall film.And somewhere in the film also the speed is lost somewhere.Otherwise some of the scenes are just out of the world. And it can show you real power of 3D cinemas in near future.I would say this is another landmark movie after Avatar for 3D cinema, though I haven't seen Avatar in 3D.So guys Don't miss this movie.

I remember when the novel Life of Pi came out and how popular it was. I have never read the book, but have read Beatrice and Virgil, which is also by Pi author Yann Martel and was very impressed with it. The movie version of Life of Pi, was nothing short of amazing. This is a film where everything seems to be done right. As readers of my reviews know, I am not a fan of 3D, or basically even in seeing films in 3D, but to me, Life of Pi was different. The 3D was not used in a self indulgent way to showcase today's technology, or to brag about it later on like so much of Peter Jackson's later films have been. Instead the 3D in this film is done to further enhance emotions and to affect us while watching certain scenes. We often see scenes of absolute beauty and some that are frightening, or perhaps ugly, but the 3D here is put to good use and is not done in an overly flashy way. The story itself I found to be incredibly moving and also inspiring. I do not want to go into too many details about the plot, so I do not spoil it for other viewers, but this is at times a deeply spiritual film that most viewers should walk away with feeling moved and grasping things that they might not have before. That is unless they are totally hard of heart. Through the journey of the main character, Pi, he learns so many important life lessons and things he can use later on in life. The film shows that while he does go through some very difficult and challenging times, that he does not quit, or give up and has the willpower and the faith to persevere even if at times everything looks absolutely hopeless. By relying not only on himself, but a higher power he is giving this endurance and strength to keep going and even during the most agonizing and stressful of times, he still has that perseverance and does not give up. It shows us that through life's trials often something very good comes out of it. In life none of us like going through challenging, or difficult times, but I think all of us can say that through difficult situations that we have gone through that we have learned more about ourselves and have become better equipped for future situations as well. Trials often bring us closer to the things that are actually important and crucial to our lives, but on the same thought, I realize that others do not always respond to them as well and lean to things that could be detrimental to one's health such as drugs, alcohol, or sex, but what if we relied on a higher power like Pi does in the film? Being a Christian myself I know all about that. Through my life I have gone through numerous trails in my life and I know that there will be more coming, but through all of those trials, I have been able to rely on God, and while often in those situations I felt anxious, or like giving up myself, I learned that he was with me through those trials and he was not going to abandon me. Every rough, or difficult situation in life I have gotten through. No, going through it was not always easy, or fun, but at the end my relationship with God improved and it often allowed me to trust and rely on Him more. Often these trials seem to be pointing out something in our lives that we need to change about ourselves. It could be something like an addiction, or some type of sin that while it may not seem so, is actually harming us rather than bringing us joy, or pleasure and do we really need those things in our life? What if we could live doing what is good for us and to keep our bodies healthy. Wouldn't that make us both happier, healthier and more appreciative that we gave up our old ways of sin, addiction and the things that caused us to stumble. Pi grows in this film as he goes through these trials. They mature him, give him a stronger and more trusting relationship and understanding of God and helps prepare and shape him for what may come in days, weeks, or even years ahead. This was such a revelation to me seeing all this on screen. I knew all this beforehand, but who doesn't need a reminder from time to time and a little encouragement never fails to help. What was often called an unfilmable book has turned into a motion picture experience that is something that I found beautiful for the eyes, ears, senses and my soul. I felt uplifted and encouraged as I left this film. It gave me so much to think about, but also so much to be thankful for in my own life. Director Ang Lee and screenwriter David Magee have given us a beautiful film here that works as a technical achievement, but on so many other levels as well. I hope that what I have said will not have turned off people from seeing it, but rather given them a curiosity to go and see it for themselves and see what they discover, or take away from it. This is a groundbreaking achievement in cinema and for our own selves as well. Be sure to see it on the big screen while you can. One of 2012's best films.

On its face, this is a ripping yarn about survival at sea, based on a novel by Canadian Yann Martel. The book version is astonishing, and the film version is literally jaw-dropping both because of its visual effects and because of its faithfulness to the source material.The novel blurs the line between "fact" and fiction, beginning with the author's note describing his pursuit of a good story, a pursuit that lands him in Pondicherry, India. There he hears of a tale that, he is told, is God-affirming. The protagonist and narrator of the story, a native Pondicherrian by the name of Piscine Molitor Patel, now lives in Martel's homeland. Martel returns to find him in Toronto. This is where the film begins, and pretty much continues in lockstep with the book.The story supposedly told to Martel by Pi Patel unfolds intriguingly from his childhood in India to his voyage at sea with his family, through tragedy and finally, to salvation. The story is infused with humor, horror, beauty, and seamanship, all aided by stunningly vivid images. At the end, the viewer and the author face a choice that may affirm theism in some, and yet allow nonbelievers to reject it.What is hard to reject is the unutterable beauty and flash of the story, and the skillful way director Ang Lee has captured it on film. Convincing performances by Suraj Sharma as the teenage Pi and Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi are stellar. No less convincing is the rendition of leading feline Richard Parker, a creation that may make you wonder where digital technology is leading us.Most movies, and fiction in general, require suspension of disbelief. In that sense, "Life of Pi" can be a challenge. That said, this film breaks new ground as terrific entertainment.

This is a three hour movie but you'll swear you were in the theater for at least 12. I don't normally mind long movies but this one was pretty slow and boring. My sister fell asleep for half of it but my brother and I were not as fortunate. There were some sporadic entertaining parts and the 3D had it's moments but that's no reason to torture yourself for the other 2 1/2 hours. Just when you think the movie is about to wrap up, the guy starts telling another story! I almost walked out right then and actually wish I did because the ending is what really made me feel cheated. *Spoiler* So you're telling me the entire story you just wasted my time with was a complete lie? I felt bad for the guy that was following him around all over the place listening to his BS for hours and hours. I think I would've probably punched him in the face. I have a history of missing the point of these artistic movies but I don't understand how lying about what happened when you got shipwrecked makes anyone closer to God.I'm going to use this technique on my girlfriend. Honey, I went to the store to buy you a gift when I was kidnapped by a unicorn that flew me to a magical island with perfume flowers and lipstick bushes. Then I killed the unicorn and escaped on a giant pterodactyl that scratched up my back and dropped me off just in time for breakfast.Oh, you don't like that story? How about, I went to the bar, got wasted and went home with some other chick last night?I've told you two stories that both result in me not coming home last night. Both stories end with me having a scratched back, lipstick on my face and neck, and smelling of perfume. Which story would you prefer? Do you believe in god now?

Acclaimed director Ang Lee has taken the supposedly unfilmable book and turned it into an overlong, technically brilliant mixed bag. Centering on a young boy who finds himself stranded on a boat with a Bengal tiger after a ferocious storm sinks the ship he was on. There is about 40 minutes before leading up to those vents where we meet the main character and his family. I got the themes of truth vs. fiction, coming of age in the face of tragedy and the symbolism of an animalistic nature, but i can't say that I got anything to deep or profound from this film. And there are many reasons I believe I didn't but here let's start with the good. The movie is technically brilliant. The effects are truly sensational especially the animal design. it's truly captivating to say the least and the movie also has some inspired whimsical cinematography. Now for the not so good I found myself unimpressed with the films human performances especially the central one. It's not that he was bad but he failed to engage especially in the face of such incredible events it just didn't feel emotionally resonant and engaging like it should have and part of that lies in the direction which I'd like to say was solid for the most par. But here's the thing once you discover what this film is about it kind of is unfilmable. It's something that works much better on the page. Because as a film it just doesn't mesh well. I don't want to ruin it for anyone thinking of seeing it. but if you're expecting to be inspired and feel as though there is a strong profound message that will mirror something in your life, you're going to be disappointed. The film is just what it is and nothing more in my opinion at least. It moves along ploddingly and although it has genuine moments of cinematic inspiration it fails to really connect on a level that counts and after a while it all feels like you are the one barely surviving.

Life of Pi is a triumph visually - one of the most magical experiences I've ever had at the movies. Even more importantly, it's a triumph of a story.I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist. When I heard the words "I was told you have a story that would make me believe in God", I was suitably skeptical.The movie did not succeed in getting me to believe in God. However, the pivotal but ever-so-subtle dialog near the end really cemented why so many people the world over choose the target of their faith.Piscene asks "Which story do you prefer?" Not "which story do you believe?" or "Which story do you think is true?", just "Which story do you prefer?" I've seen other reviews of this move that refer to the "twist" ending. There is no twist here, just an incredibly well-presented allegory. There's also many reviews talking about the triumph of endurance and human spirit. Those indeed are present in the story, but not so important as the central point - the crux of the matter."Which story do you prefer?" The answer of course is a perfect allegory of religion. The fundamental stories are similar no matter which characters are in the pivotal roles."Which story do you prefer?" As Pi answers, "And so it is with God." A faith-shaking thought indeed.Depending on how you see the world and religion's place in it, the question may affirm or cause questions of your own faith. Is your religion's story true? Or just preferred? And more importantly, does it matter? What this movie drove home for me was that religions all have the same benefits and by extension, they all have the same flaws.Which story do you prefer? To Ang Lee, Yann Martel, David Magee and all involved in bringing this story to the screen, thank you! It is so refreshing to be viscerally, philosophically and intellectually entertained all at the same time.

First all, everything is only my personal point of view and I just try to interpret this movie in my way because it really fascinated me during the 127 minutes and afterward. I am from the Orient and I think I can understand what Ang Lee, one of the greatest directors, is indicating behind those spectacular scenes.From the very beginning until almost the end, we were watching the first story. The only survivor of a shipwreck, Pi, made it after more than 200 days floating on sea, with the accompany of a tiger, Richard Parker. They fought and cooperated. It was a unbelievable journey and Pi went through a lot changes and transformation. Being a vegetarian, he had to catch and kill fish to feed both Richard Parker and himself. He was both sorry and thankful. He was on a no-one-know-it island where daytime was a heaven but nighttime was the hell. Shining whale brought away his food and another storm almost killed him. Anyway, he made it and survived and was saved finally. Almost everyone has focused on the first story, especially the amazing and mind-blowing special effects and visualizations. And some even complained about the story line and long opening before they boarded the ship. I was one of them until the very end, when in face of Japanese investigators, Pi told the second story. In this, the chef, the sailor, Pi's mother and himself. The chef ate the sailor and killed Pi's mother, which stimulated Pi and led to Pi killing the chef. Every animal has its meaning in the second story. The Zebra is the sailor, being eaten by the jackal representative of the chef, who also killed the ape symbolizing Pi's mother. The tiger, actually is Pi himself. It was what is inside Pi, also every human being, that without reasoning we are nothing but beasts. In the storm, Pi put himself against it while Richard was so scared. Storm is kind of like test from God or God himself. Our inside breasts are afraid of such tests and failed to confront it. What makes us human being diff from beasts is our belief in God and more generally human reasoning. In the end, both the writer and the Japaneses investigators chose the first story with the tiger. But what is your choice?

Oh! And what a life it is! What a visual masterwork that Ang Lee has brought to the screen. Here is a story brimming with excitement, adventure, poetry, and the strange whims of drifting destiny. Here is the story of one life, one extraordinary man and his adventure to find himself and his way back home. It is based on a best-seller by Yann Martel, but it reminds you of the kinds of stories by Rudyard Kipling. It's that good.Life of Pi tells the life story of an Indian boy named Pi (Suraj Sharma) whose father owns a zoo in Pondicherry, India. We meet him in a series of opening passages that have a tone all of their own. He was born with the name Piscine, a word which, when translated from French to English means "swimming pool", but his parents overlook how the word looks on paper and so everyone calls him by an unflattering euphemism for urination. He silences their mockery one day in the classroom by demonstrating his wizardry at mathematics by showing them the constant of 3.14. From this, he shortens his name to Pi. We follow his upbringing as he comes to questions the nature of religion, settling on theories of Muslims, Hindus and Christians, trying to get a grasp on his purpose in life. His mother wants him to explore, but his father wants him to be more practical and real. These are lessons he will take with him all through life.The zoo starts losing money, so Pi's father informs the family that they have to sell the zoo and move to Canada. They pack up their belongings and a few of the animals and board a Japanese freighter bound for their new home. Then one night a storm hits that is so ferocious that it could have come from the Bible. Pi falls into a 25-foot lifeboat and the freighter sinks. All on board are apparently killed but Pi finds himself briefly sharing the lifeboat with a zebra with a broken leg; a seasick orangutan; a hyena; and an ill-tempered Bengal tiger that turns the other animals into lunch (not to worry, it happens off-screen). Pi builds himself a raft out of oars and life-preservers and sits tethered to the boat until he can figure out how to deal with the tiger who has taken up residence in his boat.Much like Robert Zemekis' Cast Away much of this movie deals with one man's fight for survival. The two are similar in their observations of trying to deal with survival under limited conditions, but this one takes place almost completely at sea. Pi tries to keep himself hydrated with rainwater and freshwater that was stored aboard the lifeboat, and with the few rations that he has. He also tries to keep the tiger – named Richard Parker – nourished with fish that he catches with his bare hands. He knows that the beast will eventually get hungry enough to turn on him if he doesn't keep its belly full.The relationship with the tiger is not what we expect. Pi has several chances to let the beast drown or starve to death but he refuses. He admits, in his journal (which makes the excuse for voice-over narration), that the tiger is giving him instincts that he never felt before, like a new sense of alertness. What is so brilliant about the relationship is that Ang Lee never makes the mistake of making the tiger sentimental. This isn't one of those bond-with-animal movies from Disney. Lee never takes away the tiger's savage nature and that brings the story tension and a sense of grounded reality. A bond does form but it is more out of respect for the situation. Their final moments together are as real as they are touching.That reality is necessary because the film occasionally breaks away from the real world and allows us some moments that are surreal, like a visit to a living, breathing island that seems prepared to have Pi and Richard Parker for lunch. Visually the movie is breathtaking. There are shots here that are not just computer effects but are shown just to allow us some moments of pure beauty. One shot in particular takes place underwater as we are looking up at the boat with the sky behind it. There doesn't seem to be any water there and Pi seems to just be floating on air. The CG effects here are miraculous, especially in giving life to the tiger. He is a savage beast, yes, but eventually we see him as Pi sees him, and we come to like him without finding him cuddly. This is a movie that respects animals by not making the mistake of trying to humanize them.What happens in the film's final act is a question left to the viewer over the validity of what we have just seen. There are many questions to be raised about those moments and many that are difficult to discuss without giving away spoilers. The ending will illicit many deep discussions afterwards.To watch Life of Pi is to observe how few films really consider their characters, how few consider the spiritual journey of the adventure they are undertaking. A lot of films are about journeys of violence or revenge but can hardly be bothered to deal with what the characters have learned. This movie is so much more than that.

Based on Yann Martel's 2001 novel of the same name, Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' is a Stunning motion-picture, that delivers in high regard. Not only is it visually stunning, but its also solidly written, fabulously directed & beautifully acted. A Big Winner! 'Life of Pi' Synopsis: A young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor ... a fearsome Bengal tiger.David Magee's Adapted Screenplay is solid & offers nail-biting moments all through the adventure. Ang Lee's is a master at his craft & he directs this adventure fabulously. The Special Effects are outstanding, among the finest I've ever seen. The use of 3D is remarkable. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are marvelous.Performance-Wise: Suraj Sharma as Pi, delivers a compelling performance. He takes us through this unbelievable adventure & delivers at every step. Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi, is splendid, as usual. The Ever Terrific Tabu is a pleasure to watch. Adil Hussain is perfect. Gérard Depardieu barely has any role.On the whole, 'Life of Pi' is a must watch.

Life of Pi flows like an ocean, calm and subtle in the beginning and with lots of emotion later. The movie can be considered one of the greatest films released this year and Ang Lee shows his directorial genius once again. The 3D effects, the music and cinematography enhance the director's vision, and the film pays full justice to the book and this is the beauty of the film.The images created by the film stay with you even after leaving the film. As the movie moves, the viewer becomes engaged more in Pi's story and the acting done by Suraj Sharma gives Pi a new dimension. Irrfan Khan does a good job and the movie progress through his narration of the story of Pi. The graphics department mentions a great appreciation for they makes the directors vision a reality and makes the audience glue to their seat,especially the tiger. Do watch the film if you don't want to miss one of the greatest films released this year..Thumbs up for the movie

A survival story of a young boy along with a Tiger, alone in the middle Pacific Ocean Ang Lee takes on the arduous task of translating Yann Martel's 'Life of Pi' into a beautiful film. He showed how a young boy survives at ocean for 227 days with a Bengal tiger. The movie is visually enchanting.The movie keeps you guessing about whats going to happen next and it makes you indulge in it with amazing 3D effect.The story line is slow but gripping.Put your 3D glasses on and join the adventurous cruise along with a Royal Bengal Tiger.It is Highley recommended for everyone because while watching you just feel that it should continue... Amazing direction.

I would consider this movie to be the best movie of this year.The storytelling is great , The characters development is superb and the cinematography is breathtaking.The movie conveys a lot without directly stating it . Richard parker, for example could never be seen as not being a wild animal, managed to be someone due to whom Pi was able to survive.The development of Pi's personality as the movie went along was really natural, I did not just watch this movie ,But experienced it.The part which really moved me was the end. The insurance people, who were not ready to believe in Pi's first story ended up using it for their report because the story with people in it was too uncomfortable for them.That gives us a insight into how human society works.This movie is really a masterpiece.Hats off to the director and everyone involved in the making

This movie is very different than I expected. Knowing about all that was shown on trailers (a bunch of animals swimming and a kid on a boat with a tiger) I went into this movie with no solid expectations. I thought it would be more whimsical and magical, but for the most part the story stays on par with realism. The CG was fantastic, it was often hard to distinguish between the CG tiger and a real one. It was a pretty grand movie but what seemed on a smaller scale. No real big name US actors. I wanted to see it in 2D, but went to the 3D one instead. If you see this, I definitely recommend 3D. It was amazing having a tiger jump out at you or have the boys spear pointing at you when he is training the tiger.This movie was a treat and I recommend seeing it. I really enjoyed the ride. Let me know what you think, ryanhartford86@yahoo.com, If you hated it, loved it, either way I'd love to hear from you!

Nice visual effects, but sorry, the movie was boring. There were so many elements introduced that could have played out as being relevant to the story, but in the end didn't connect together at all. We learn how Pi got his name. That is amusing, but so what? He could have been named Paul or Peter. Being named Pi had nothing to do with the story, and so was a waste of screen time. Similarly, other elements introduced early on carried no meaning in the story. The book was the same way. It's like the author "felt" there had to be some meaning there, and so he threw a spaghetti mess of ideas on the wall, hoping some strands would stick. Shoddy story telling. I will say the visual effects were nice. But... visual effects these days do not a movie make. Very disappointing effort over all.

A group of varied personalities form a paranormal company in order to catch ghosts and save New York City.Based on Ivan Reitman "Ghost Busters" written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis without drawing any comparisons to the 1984 classic, Ghostbusters 2016 is 116m 28s of stylish sleek fun. Ghostbusters writers Katie Dippold and Paul Feig interestingly bring the team together with clean cut modern cinematic swagger. Feig, director of 2015's Spy, turns his hand effortlessly to an effects driven comedy friendship rework.With a Disney Haunted Mansion-like opening with a genuine jump scare, to animated mannequins and joy riding ghosts (including Slimer), there's plenty of ectoplasm on display (that appears to follow) the excellent cast, especially Kristen Wiig's Gilbert. Haunted by a paranormal encounter as a child, Gilbert who's co- written ghost book loses her job when a ghost encounter video goes viral. Wiig along with kooky hot engineer Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon light up the screen (no pun intended) and soup loving Melissa McCarthy's Abby Yates and Leslie Jones' subway worker Tolan provide the comedy backbone.While the scripted comedy doesn't go for subtle wit, with some physical gags its mostly more on the nose comedy, infused with pop culture references, including Ghost and The Exorcist to name a few, it genuinely has its laugh out loud moments, Feig even throws in a fart joke for good measure. There's lots of chuckles to be had, many come from Gilbert's and Yates former, later rekindled friendship. Feig offers excellent set-ups and set pieces as proton packed armed they go about busting spooks in a rock concert (where Ozzy Osbourne cameos), the city street and subway at one point using some new toys. There are many memorable moments, a scene where they run some tests like Peter Parker trying out his web, along with a moment where Holtzmann goes all Clint Eastwood western to name a few. McCarthy and Jones' comedy timing is impeccable, with smart Wiig and wacky genius McKinnon bouncing off wonderfully - firmly stamping their mark. But overtly focal Chris Hemsworth sends his persona up somewhat as dim witted eye candy Kevin and steals many of the best moments.As the team discover there's a disturbed bell boy Rowan North (Neil Casey) amplifying paranormal activity in New York, during a carnival of phantoms we get to see the Marshmallow Man in balloon form and a pilgrim ghost take on the team. If anything the excellent CGI spirits on occasion are more spectral beings rather than the departed traditional dead, there's a giant Gremlin-like flying creature and holographic like ghouls trapped in mirrors. Ghostbusters moves along at breakneck speed, and while the main bad guy may lack weight and grit thankfully this is counteracted by the genuine likable and watchable main cast.While the CGI may lack that Indiana Jones/Poltergeist 80's optical feel. The colourful ghost effects on display - reminiscent of Beetle Juice and akin to the original second outing, along with the Ghostbuster (universe) cartoons, comics etc. have a charm of their own. At one time their Ghostbuster logo literally appears animated when Rowan mocks the team prior to him trying to destroy the city in a vortex, which lucky for the insurance company leaves little, if any mess. There are some fridge logic moments, why build a containment unit instead of zapping them into slimy gloop, unless it's to study, either way I'm sure Ghostbusters aficionados will be able to explain.There's an array of welcomed cameos for series fans from the likes of Ernie Hudson, as the undertaker Bill and uncle of Tolan, to Bill Murray, in a surprising extended cameo as Martin Heiss, who accuses the Ghostbusters of being fraudsters. Dan Aykroyd, has an excellent brief appearance as the all knowing cab driver. Even Annie Potts appears as a hotel desk clerk, snapping the crowning, "What do you want?" Andy Garcia shows up as the Teflon Mayor and humorously loses it when he is compared to the Mayor in Jaws. While Charles Dance's small role is fittingly cast as Gilbert's uptight University Dean.Feig offers along with the familiar theme tune supernatural hijinks and enough jump scare frights to give the youngsters the heebie jeebies. Dedicated to Harold Ramis, stick around for some end credit antics plus a post credit scene where Sigourney Weaver briefly appears as Holtzmann's mentor Rebecca Gorin and the team discovers the name Zuul for the fist time, setting it up for a sequel.Overall, with the controversial backlash and odd marketing now in the grave, as with any kind of rework comparisons will be made, taking my nostalgia glasses off, as a film in its own right, it's spectre- tacular fun and comes recommend.

As far as the end result... ...the film completely fell flat across the board. I have nothing against the four leads. I more or less blame the writers, director and the studios choice of direction for the new Ghostbusters.The acting is some of the most stiff and cookie cutter I have ever seen. There were times when it really sounded like they were reading their lines. The actors did NOT mesh well at all and their interaction with all of the blue and green screen effects was lifeless and clueless.I was just lost with the approach on their attempted humor. I mean, it's bad. I don't know what panel sat around the table reading the script and laughed at it, but I hope they never do again.The effects were horrible. Every time, which was A LOT, they used a green screen, I found myself taken away from the movie.The film constantly contradicts it's own established continuity. One minute they can't kill the ghosts, only contain them, the next, they can. Just ridiculous.They even added a segment to the movie early on that shows the four girls poking fun at all of the hate for the film. I just don't think the studio gets it. More mocking of the very people they expect to pay top dollar for their product.Despite all of the sexist remarks towards the movie, the movie itself is EXTREMELY sexist against men and borderline racist. All men are portrayed as fools in the movie and in order to kill the final villain they have to shoot him in the crotch. It almost seems the team behind the film knew how stereotypical and sexist their movie was, so they capitalized on the sexism against the film in order to hide that.I honestly recommend wearing a padded glove when you watch this, IF you watch this. I have never face-palmed so many times during a movie in my life. I would not suggest this film to anyone except maybe children under ten years old and even then, it would simply be for a cartooned 3D experience.I wish I could find positives because I dislike being so negative about a film. I understand completely the amount of work that goes into something like this. Chris Hemsworth was probably the best part of this believe or not. I could see him leading a team of his own Ghostbusters in another version if written correctly.But I can't help but quote Jurassic Park concerning the very idea of this film.The filmmakers "were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should."I really did try to give this film a chance despite all of the negative hype. But, the film was not funny and does not stand on it's own. Honestly, the only thing that intrigued me was seeing the cameos from some of the original cast.I will add that if you were thinking you had seen the majority of the movie throughout all of the trailers, various clips, TV spots, etc., you would have been thinking correctly. Sony used all of what they considered to be the best material in all of the promotional releases. Let that be your red flag considering how poor the trailers were.If someone were to ask me if they should go see it, I would say, "No, but if you are curious, just wait for it to become available for Internet streaming."I don't think people will walk away from this movie afraid of ghosts. I imagine they walk away afraid of the movie and more so, the people who thought it was wise to make it in the first place.There is some irony here. Ghostbusters 2016 has literally become a ghost. It was dead on arrival.

I went to the cinema with mixed feelings about this movie. I have never been a big Ghostbusters fan, but i really enjoyed the Feig/McCarthy movie Spy, and i hoped that this one would be in the same alley.In some few nuggets of comedy there are moments where you laugh good,but it is a little bit oxymoron that it is Hemsworth that actually provides these moments of comedy gold. Because it is obvious that there is a a political statement in this movies, to the jokes about how stupid men to the end battle where the bad guy gets castrated.This would not bug me so much if the comedy was quality. Unfortunately its not. McKinnon and Jones are good, talentful comedians, but this movie is not right for them. Mainly because they need some more movie-experience to get the timing and body-language that is required by a top-movie, SNL can not provide that before tackling a Blockbuster-production like Ghostbusters. Especially McKinnon suffers here, as she has trouble with finding her own identity in a role that is more than a 5 min sketch on SNL, and her body language is trying to be a Jim Carrey light, without succeeding. In scenes where she is supposed to be in the background, she does strange things that draws the attention from the dialogue of the rest of the crew.McCarthy is comfortable with Feig and they perform much of the same routine as they did in Spy, while Wiig manages to balance her role good enough. However, the big star of this movie is Hemsworth that is the pillar of comedy in this movie. His line and "dumbwitted" acting is perfect for the role.Now, the biggest problem is the lack of a good foundament for the franchise. Feig unfortunately does not dare to go his own way, and the story feel forced to appeal to everyone. Some of the dialogue is also cringe-worthy (the power of patty) and made go into fetal position on the cinema-chair.There is no clear picture of what Ghostbusters want to be, and if a sequel comes, i hope Feig dares to make his own vision clearer in the movie.So to end this review, not good, Hemsworth steals the show and makes it worthwhile.

Let me lay the ground clear: I really enjoyed the first two Ghostbusters films and hated all the marketing for this film, and dreaded its existence for some time. I confess I only saw this film because I received free tickets to the premiere. I went in with zero expectations and came out very pleasantly surprised. The new Ghostbusters is pretty damn good. It's (fairly) consistently funny, in unique and inventive ways, and showcases a host of impressive effects. What's great about the film is the writing. Paul Feig is a real natural at comedy, and once more he directs a script layered with witty dialogue. Of course, these are matched by excellent comedic performances. McCarthy does her usual shtick well enough, Kate McKinnon is slightly underused, but is absolutely hilarious, and even Leslie Jones, while a tad one note, proves nonetheless endearing. Kristen Wiig is probably the blandest of the four, yet plays a good straight (wo)man. The real surprise is Chris Hemsworth, who I honestly thought would be terrible in this, from marketing and trailers, but stole all of the best lines as an incredibly daft receptionist. Aside from providing a bit of kibble for gender role reversal, his performance reminded me of Brad Pitt in Burn After Reading, an attractive leading man who totally mocks himself in a comedy role, and it's similarly hilarious. In all, these characters and performances ensure the movie passes it's run time enjoyably. The negatives revolve around a plot that seems to short change a villain to only a few scenes, and culminate in a climax that seemed overlong, albeit capped off by an incredible vortex scene, you'll know it when you see it. Yet even if the plot is lacking in its mechanics somewhat, the movie never takes itself seriously enough (a la Tarzan or Batman vs Superman) for you to really mind. It knows its ridiculous. Another plus is the 3D, which was legitimately well done, a rarity for the medium. To be honest, misogyny debates aside, the marketing for this film was abnormally lacking, it's baffling to me how they reduced a film packed with funny gags to a trailer that was so cringe, but I implore you, if you love the first films, give this flick a chance, I'm sure it'll surprise a lot of people as it did me. Don't hate this movie for the sake of it, especially as I see this thing has a rating of 4.2, that's just plain unfair. If you go looking for fun, undemanding entertainment, that's exactly what you'll get, made with intelligence, wit and verve.

Okay,let's begin,Is Ghostbusters a good film? No. Is Ghostbusters a bad film? Kind of. The first 40 minutes or so I considered to be pretty strong, especially the opening 10 minutes which had me wondering if this was actually going to be good!? So the 'first act' I really enjoyed. Not all the characters pop, but those that do really shine. Chris Helmsworth and Kate McKinnon Im looking at you.Sadly, its all down hill from there. There's more horrible cameos than I care to mention and some terrible cringe moments especially when it comes to music choice for the films soundtrack. DMX "Up in in here", the the terrible band in the concert scene and the butchering of the original theme tune would leave me wincing in my seat.I reckon this film will have a fairly average take when it opens in the US this weekend and then disappear in to the bad remake/reboot garbage pile.Ghostbusters 2? I don't think we'll need to worry about this happening.

I was unfortunate enough to see an early screening with a friend and... man, this movie isn't bad; it's TERRIBLE. BEYOND TERRIBLE. It's getting mixed to positive reviews, but the people liking this movie are the same people who jumped on-board the feminist "everyone who hates this film is a misogynist" train and they don't even mention anything beyond the parts they cherry-picked to like in the movie. Throughout the hour and a half + movie, the movie made a desperate attempt to be good to the point where it just appeared like they were trying too hard. Much of the humor is forced and most of the jokes are basic and can be seen/guessed even before the scene rolls. At times, it felt cheap and lazy. I thought I was watching a failing SNL parody rather than a good movie.Leslie Jones is another problem; she portrays a stereotypical black woman with an attitude. Yelling? Check. Bitch slapping? Check. Every single stereotype about black woman? Check. Remember Winston Zeddemore from the original film? Was he a stereotypical black man at the time in the 1980s? Nope. Instead, he was an Average Joe who wanted a job and took it at Ghostbusters. Here, Leslie portrays her character in an almost-offensive manner when it comes to playing a stereotypical black woman. It's borderline inappropriate and, had she been a man, this film would've been TRASHED by critics for this portrayal of a character. Also, it's Reverse Sexism in a film. Instead of treating both genders equally, Paul Feig displays men as idiots or assholes. This is true with Hemsworth's character, Kevin, who is the team's secretary. He's completely stupid, clueless and innocent; but mostly stupid. Janine in the original film was a smart, capable woman who had a lot of memorable moments and wasn't portrayed in a sexist, if not really unattractive manner. I almost walked out of the early screening because of how poorly men were portrayed in the film. And, probably, by now, everyone has heard of the atrocious final resolution to the final battle. SPOILER ALERT: SKIP IF YOU WANNA ACTUALLY SEE THIS BURNING DUMPSTER FIRE.The final battle is resolved by shooting Rowan in the dick. That's right; four chicks shoot Rowan in the dick with their proton packs. -.- You probably already know this because of the GIF floating around the inter-webs, but, yeah. That's how the final battle ends; a really sexist approach to finishing the film. It sounds mild, but combine this with the portrayal of Kevin, Bill Murray's cameo and a few other male characters who interact with the main characters and you have a feminist film ready to go.Along with these criticisms come with the really bad script that just acts like imitation crab in the food world; it's just an imitation. In fact, half the plot imitates the original in a distasteful manner that just really turns off Ghostbusters fans. It's unoriginal and it pays little homage to the films. When it does, it does it in lackluster fashion. Like, for example, Stay Puft's official sighting in this film is in parade balloon form, not true marshmallow form. If you were expecting at least one showdown with the destructive Puft himself, think again. He has been replaced by the logo ghost. XD There's so much wrong with this movie, but these things are just a few of them. Thanks Paul Feig for messing Ghosbusters up. I guess Paul's been Busted and it felt good busting' this travesty of a film that will haunt GB fans for generations.PROS: -Chris Hemsworth (For the most part) -Complete relief when the film endedCONS: -Terrible acting -Abismal writing -Huge gaping plot holes (Like the inability to buy the firehouse but the ability to create advanced ghost busting technology and obtain parts and equipment.) -Poor CGI effects -Disrespectful cameos and treatment of original material -Reverse sexist message -A stereotypical caricature of a black woman (Leslie Jones as Patty) -Useless inclusion of Patty into the GB team -Non-existent character chemistry -Disappointing final battle which breaks all GB rules first established in the film -Unmemorable soundtrack -Poor editing -Inappropriate responses to constructive criticism hidden in film -Dull, ineffective, dry forced-humor -Identity crisis (Reboot or Sequel. Choose one, Feig.) -Laughable film effort in generalThis film is BUSTED and busting this travesty of a film makes me feel good; better than good... GREAT.1/10 10/100 1/5 F

This movie isn't that good. Granted it does have some good legit funny scenes, but it's pretty terrible. The stupid man trope isn't dying anytime soon and the fact that they killed off Bill Murray and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, oh god. Most of the "humor" is references and the CGI looks REALLY terrible. The weapons and action are cute, but the villain is so obvious, you could just have a arrow saying "he's the villain" So to round up, it has some good scenes and I won't mind buying it on DVD, but the fact that it's got bad comedy, CGI, an obvious villain AND the stupid male character trope, that's it's best to not see this movie.Just go watch the original, it's SO much better.

Likes : Right first of all this review is not a reflection of the female casting for the film , it an honest & fair review on the film itself..Judge by the trailer i knew something was off about this film, so i went in to watch this film with low expectation so not to be disappointed , i really wanted this film to higher my expectation & come out the cinema impressed with it to say it was good sadly this doesn't i will explain in dislikes.Its so easy to compare the original Ghostbuster film with this film as a few thing in the film pay homage to certain thing from the original, they didn't do a bad job with the cameos of the original cast , two scene with ghost weren't that bad they were kind of creepy just by the nature of their reaction & manor.As for cast Melissa McCarthy & Kristen Wiig really were the only two to stands out with performance , Leslie Jones & Kate McKinnon do there best to bring comedy to the film with the script they are give but too many flaws in this film that complete drags this film down.The only two to really stood out was Chris Hemsworth play the geek dumb guy & Neil Casey who playing the villain in the film, he stood out as the villain creepy off hinge person hell bent of open a portal to destroy the world which if done better would have been a great film but sadly this was poorly done, there is a end credit scene if your will to stay after the credits roll.Dislikes : Where do i start , i was hoping this film would prove me wrong & actually turn out to be a good film instead it was the most pain film I've ever sat through that i almost walked out on. In all honesty this did not feel like a Ghostbusters film due to it lack of story , there were long scene where they just aren't doing anything & testing equipment instead of having scene like they did with the original film going out & capturing ghosts.Where the comedy? ..........Seriously i mean this is meant to be a comedy the joke were just awful this is the major problem this film had, with the original it was funny because the cast bounce off each other with banter, sadly with this casting just didn't work on screen. This casting might be funny on SNL show with short scene but trying to be funny through a whole film just wasn't the right casting , Kristen Wiig is a good actress but she just hasn't got that comedy in her because she more of a serious role actress & Kate McKinnon was seriously uncomfortable to watch it was like she was trying to force the comedy which made it even worst.(spoiler alert) There is a scene where the villain freezes everyone in what look like a dance scene like the mask but never happened thank god but this scene just felt so out of place wasn't necessary for the film, don't get me start on the scene after with the main villain , the film already lost me attention half way through but that scene just killed the film straight way , because it was like something out of a bad who framed roger rabbit scene.Although some scene with the C.G.I were pretty well done, there are moments with seriously bad green scene effects that just look awful on the screen making seriously obvious that it was green scene that complete lost the shoot of the scene realism. The film as whole felt more like a bad cartoon turn to a poorly made film , because the villain at the end as a seriously rip off of the original stay puff just a more creeper version , it just poorly written with a poor concept story that could have been done better, because i mean the film is meant to be about capturing ghost yet the scene in the new York square contradicts everything the film is meant to be portraying which a bad mistake for the film.All i can say to Sony is don't allow Paul Feig to direct another Ghostbusters film ever again, because this was a very lazy poor attempt at revamp the franchise.4 out of 10

I am actually amazed at how many people see the 1984 original as one of the best movies of all-time. It's a good fun film with a few laughs, nothing more. In fact, the sequel is probably as the good as its predecessor in my opinion.As for this re-make, many of you know that the build-up and marketing for this film has gone pretty bad to say the least. With every trailer and TV spot not showing much promise and new theme song being ripped to shreds. A lot of people are giving this film so much hate, that they are not even going to see it and give it a chance.I will have to agree that I have not liked what I have seen either. The main things is the comedy, the gags did not make me laugh at all and had me shaking my head. Some of the casting did not give me much promise. When I say casting, I do not mean because they are female. That being said, I went into the screening with an open mind like I do with all my films. And you know what, it was all right.The opening scene brings in you in nicely and gives the film some promise. The early character development is pretty solid and I was found the characters believable in their aims and what they wanting out of this. It moves a long nicely, even with some bits not quite working. I remained keen to see how the film would end and it was a pleasant final act.The main thing going into what is a comedy, is to see whether it will make you laugh. For me, I laughed I would say fairly steadily throughout the film. Yes, some gags did not work, but some did. Thankfully the ones that didn't, did not make me shake my head in disgust. It just did not work for me. The good stuff did make me chuckle, and I was surprised at the amount of movie references it made which pleased me.The writing is probably its strongest positive. It is sharp, it's witty at times and there is a lot of nice science tech talk like I remember the original Ghostbusters having, which I was not expecting.The performances were pretty solid from every department and the chemistry worked fairly well. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig might not have been stand-outs, but they were certainly solid leads. McCarthy toned down the McCarthy most people associate with her, and we get a good team leader. Kate McKinnon might not have totally fulfilled my hopes from what I saw of her in the trailer. But I still was entertained by her character. She does get a bit over-the-top. But it was a pretty transition from her works on TV. From what I can tell, it is a pretty hard skill to move from TV into film. Everything about Leslie Jones in the trailer was all one note and very annoying, and I did not think she would go anywhere. Amazingly, she is not annoying. Yes, there are moments that would have liked to get rid of. But I thought she felt like a valuable part of the team. I never thought I would actually type that about Leslie Jones.Chris Hemsworth was really funny in it. He definitely has the best gags. They were so silly and random and yet very clever and well delivered. Some are just silly, went too far and did not work. But the majority of them were great. I must mention that there is a lot of cameos in this, and in more ways than one. There are cameos of actors/characters from the original, references to quotes from the film. Some worked well, some didn't, and some were just truly awful. Even at times, they looked forced and it made the film's pace slow down. It is almost as if the studio told them to put one in every 15 minutes. I don't mind there being cameos. However, if they had toned that down a bit, they might have made the film stand alone by itself.But thankfully, it is by far not the worst thing I have seen this year. The story was perfectly fine and felt like a Ghostbusters film. It was well developed, you knew exactly what was going on and it made me interested to see how it would conclude. To those many haters that are boycotting it. Go and see it as it is a solid film, and with it being released in a summer where the big budget films have not lived up to anything, it is certainly one of the more memorable ones.One thing that I certainly was not expecting was how they constructed the end credits. In fact, this could be a landmark moment for how big budget films conduct their credits. Most do fancy graphics for the first portion of the credits, and then the rest is just a black background and rolling text. Ghostbusters managed to make the whole credits segment worth watching. From a visual standpoint, it did something really interesting with the credits, that I hope a lot of future blockbuster films take on board.Speaking of credits, there is a post-credits scene. It is certainly interesting. But I think it is gone down the route of many re-makes, which was a shame. However, I will be intrigued to see where they go with it.Rating: 7/10

So this film has been talked about allot recently but I have now seen the new Ghostbusters film and yeah this film isn't very good. The premise sees four women attempt to stop new York from being taken over by ghosts. Melissa McCarthy, Kristen wigg, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones are the Ghostbusters and there all alright in this film. I thought they had decent chemistry together and were sometimes funny. Its just I didn't really care about them as individual characters and I didn't think anyone stood out enough to truly care. Chris hemsworth plays Kevin there assistant and he does a good job as the funny bumbling idiot that works well with the girls. Unfortunately, though the villain is just very cliché and over the top making him completely useless and pointless to the plot of this film. The story in the film is incredibly simple and messy. It just has nothing to it, the characters don't develop at all and the main villain plot doesn't make entire sense. The script has some funny dialogue in it, it just never got me truly laughing too much. Also the dramatic moments all feel forced in the film. The style has some cool action scenes with some decent cgi ghosts involved. However, the film is overly long and the pacing of this film is a bit all over the place. Overall I don't think this film is as bad as everyone expected but it isn't worth seeing especially if you are a fan of the material.

I'm delighted to say that I loved this film. I may not have the same nostalgic adoration for the original Ghostbusters as so many people, but I was so glad that I could enjoy this as an individual movie, one that proves that Paul Feig and his crew can do almost no wrong, thanks to a hilarious script and great performances throughout.That's the one thing that I want to emphasise about this film: it's more a Paul Feig comedy than a Ghostbusters remake. For over an hour, this film diverts hugely from the 1984 movie, focusing far more on its own characters than simply copying the original beat- for-beat. Also, as a Paul Feig movie, it's absolutely hilarious from start to finish.It might not have the same raunchy humour as Spy and Bridesmaids, but there are still so many laughs throughout Ghostbusters. Given the poor trailers ahead of the film, I expected the impressively funny start to wear off, but I was hugely surprised to find that I was laughing a good few times every minute for about three quarters of this movie, and so was everyone else in the cinema.The comedy in this film is absolutely excellent, without a doubt, and the writers did a fantastic job to make a PG-13 blockbuster so consistently funny. However, the biggest reason why I found this film so hilarious was definitely the performances.Living up to their predecessors fantastically, the lead actresses Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones were all very entertaining. However, the real stand-outs from this movie are Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon.Hemsworth, in a relatively small and simple role, is absolutely hilarious every time he's on screen. It's a performance that goes way beyond the bounds of anything he's done before, but he makes what would normally be a pretty repetitive role, playing the brain- dead receptionist, hugely funny, adding an extra level of humour to the film beyond the four leading ladies.But the person who was even funnier than Hemsworth was Kate McKinnon. Throughout the film, I'm certain that she accounted for 90% of the biggest laughs, even having me in tears laughing so hard at one moment. She plays Holtzmann, the bizarre but brilliant scientist, to absolute perfection, with an on-point balance between purely bizarre humour and side-splitting physical comedy, making her the brightest spot at the centre of this hugely funny movie.However, I do have one clear flaw with Ghostbusters: its story. Whilst the comedy was consistently hilarious from start to finish, when the film strays more into action/blockbuster territory, it feels a little two-dimensional and predictable. The action and sci- fi is certainly something the original did far better, and when this film tries to emulate it, it's too much like a retreading of the original, which was disappointing to see.Overall, however, I couldn't help loving this film. Yes, its story may be too similar to the original, but the rest of this film is an example of how to remake a movie. It introduces new characters that take the film in a different direction, and give it its own identity, as a fantastically funny movie with some of the best comedic performances in recent years.

Awful but not necessarily for the reason you would expect.Despite some early reviews I've read or watched I didn't find the movie to be anti-male. There was nothing offensively anti-man in it that wasn't something I've already seen before and laughed off a million times. Unfortunately that's part of the problem this movie has with humor creativity. There was nothing there to laugh about.Thankfully Patty Tolan isn't a walking/talking stereotype. They made her a New York City historian instead of a caricature with "street smarts". Sadly, they didn't do her any other favors. Nor were the other characters flushed out at all.Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy play a pair of old friends who re-unite but I never get much of a sense they were anything but aware they were in a movie. They try to riff and play off each other but it kind of falls flat.Kate McKinnon's character stands out the most in this movie. The character just seemed too weird in an unrealistic way. She seemed to try chewing up scenery any time she was on a call sheet, even if she didn't have much to say. She didn't feel like she fit into what was happening.One actress that stood out to me was Cecily Strong. Cecily Strong stood out to me the same way Kristen Wiig first stood out to me in Knocked Up. She only has a very small role in the movie but she's able to be convincing and funny without making it seem like she's in on the joke.The performances weren't bad per se, they were just very underwhelming all-around. As a result, the film itself does not succeed.I did like how the ghosts look in the movie. I also like the choice the filmmakers make at the end regarding the classic logo. However I have to be harsh on this movie because it's a reboot that ultimately did not need to be made.Not only did they attempt to reboot a comedy (tell the same joke twice in a row and see how well it works the second time - comedy is a very very delicate thing and you need to respect the audience) but they went for a movie that originally caught lightning in a bottle. I don't even think Ghostbusters II did enough to justify existing. Maybe the lessons we didn't learn back when the sequel was made are the same lessons we won't learn from the reboot.

This movie is flawed and utterly biased towards sexism. And example of one the flaws is that they describe the proton packs on this movie (and the previous) as a weapon made to contain ghosts, so they can be trapped. So, in no shape or form, it has the ability to kill them. As you can see, they throw that canon piece of logic out the window as soon as you get to the "big fight scene". That utterly looks like four people fighting with a green screen behind them.And biased. All male characters are depicted as inept, dumb, aggressive and very poor at their jobs. Every single one of them. Sure, you can sprinkle it here and there for comedic effect, but that was not the director choice on this movie. It makes it look like a man bashing film, because it "kinda" is. The only exception they made was the villain, and even so... let's just say he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. It is so man hating, the final scene, who was already spoiled on the trailers, so no spoiler warning here, the way they defeat him is a proton pack to the crotch. Yeh, let's talk about emasculating moves.About the characters. They are four fine actresses, and I love their work on previous gigs (SNL, for instance). So much so, the movie itself almost looks like a hour long skit. They didn't mesh well, and it showed, time and time again. Maybe because they were made so cartooney, all suspension or disbelief of reality were just impossible to reach. I have to point out the work of Leslie Jones, tho. She played the role of the token black women, and all they said to her was "be the loud, in your face, cliché, over the top black woman you can be"... and she delivered. Is that funny? For the first 30 seconds. After that? No. And the "male Janine". Yep, Thor. That was introduced as eye candy for women. And they empathize that. He was hilarious, almost the saving grace of this movie. But, if the roles were reversed, feminists would cry foul, and they'd be right. That's your logic right there. Regardless, we always knew Chris Hemsworth was capable of a comedic role in his bag of tricks, he just proved he was capable of that with a very poor written script.The cameos were also almost the saving grace of the movie... until you realize they were there to pull the heart strings of fans to go see it. But, the way they were written in, they could have been done by anyone else. It's almost like the ex you were terribly in love with, wanted to spend the rest of your life with, but things ended, and badly. And now you fail to acknowledge them when you walk pass them on the street. Yeh, a smile, a nod, two or three words, but nothing to remember in the end of the day.But i'll give 5 stars on this movie on one aspect. The cringe factor. I wont say details, I'll save the surprise for when you see it (or don't see it), but they went the extra mile by not going the mile, so the cringe is there, and it's real.I could really go on and nitpick on everything that is wrong on this movie, on screen, and out of it. The list, sadly, is long, and the reasons are well based. It's a shame what the movie is and ended up as being, and for the longest time I hoped that all the bad publicity they were festering were just a publicity stunt. You know, a big joke and the punchline was actually a watchable, fun, blockbuster movie. What they presented... was a ghost shaped turd with a bow.

It's hard not to review the Ghostbusters reboot without commenting on the animosity that the marketing for the movie has received before its release. I totally accept that it's a tough job to effectively remake a classic film that's beloved by so many people (including myself) but I went into the cinema on opening night with an open mind and reasonably neutral expectations.The film is essentially a modern remake/reboot of the original 1980's comedy classic, only this time the lead cast are all female. It's really refreshing to see an almost completely female driven Hollywood blockbuster with varied, interesting, likable and often very funny women. The chemistry between the four leads is palpable but Kate McKinnon steals the show as kooky and ingenious scientist Jillian Holtzmann. I was, however, disappointed to see that the feminism in the film has gone so far as to have all male characters as either completely stupid or evil. Chris Hemsworth plays a male version of the stereotypical blond bimbo. He's actually often very funny and clearly looks like he enjoyed every minute filming his part. However, I would have welcomed at least one intelligent and rounded male character.Technically, the 3D effects are excellent with some clever use of letter-boxing; the visual effects are adequate and the score and soundtrack is lively with perhaps an excessive use of covers of the original Ghostbusters theme song.I had a lot of fun with Ghostbusters, the laughs come fast enough and the cast chemistry holds proceedings together. There's a dip in pace in the middle act due to the thin plot but things pick up again quickly for a rousing finale. I know many of you will have a concern that this movie will destroy a classic. Honestly, it won't. It's not exceptional but it's lots of fun and worthy of your time.7/10

Firstly I have to say.......I was dreading this movie but I thought I would give it the benefit of doubt. The result? WOW, I was really surprised! The trailers really did it no justice whatsoever. They were shocking in fact. Today I walked into the cinema with an open mind. What happened for the next 2 hours? I laughed! MY GOD did I laugh. This was brilliant. The characters were brilliant. Kate McKinnon was beyond quirky. She really made it for me. The rest of the cast (including the cameos) were all great but Kate really knocked the ball out of the court. Okay, so the special effects could have been more dark, more scary but some scenes I felt certainly portrayed a disturbing side which at the same time were visually joyful to watch. This really felt like a ghostbusters movie. All the throwbacks gave me the feeling of nostalgia, not directly connected to the original but it works in its own way. It's a really worthy reboot that deserves all the best reviews it can get. Why? Because you WILL leave the cinema with a HUGE smile on your face. Yes I would have liked to see a continuation of the original but I would rather have this than have nothing at all because none of the cast would get together to make a handover movie that they were all 100% pleased with. It could have worked. It still could. It just wasn't meant to be right now, then this gem came along. Forever Ghostbusters will remain a favourite of mine. This here is something else. It's a new reboot in its own right and it will please a few old and an entirely new audience. Go see this and make up your own mind but I think it deserves its 10 out of 10

I enjoyed Spy.. I also loved The Heat and Bridesmaids. So I am not another one of those men who hates leading women or can't think they are funny.I paid extra to watch it in 3D and the Dbox (the seat that moves with the action). It still wasn't enough to save the movie. I am not a hater. I obviously paid my hard earned money in order to be entertained. Chris Hemsworth saved the movie. I just find it ironic that it took a man, who is not even a comedian to get all the laughs in the movie. But the 4 leading women did not get any laughs from the audience. The effects were top notch and I enjoyed the action sequences and my rumbling D-box and 3D gimmicks made up for the bad movie that it was. If I watched it in 2D, there would be no saving it. Kristen Wiig was genuinely good in this movie and brought some heart and emotion to the character. She was doing her best to do a good job, but the rest of the actresses seemed to be trying so hard to be funny and quirky and it just came off as lame and ultra cringe. The biggest offender of this was Kate McKinnon - she was trying WAY too hard to be funny and quirky. It seemed so forced.Nothing about the movie felt epic or larger than life. Nobody in the theater laughed at any of the ladies trying to be funny, but they laughed at Chris Hemsworth's character, who was genuinely funny. My biggest gripe; Every man in this movie is portrayed in this movie as incompetent, a creep, or dumb. There is not a single male character in here that a young boy can look up to. Yet another disturbing trend on today's culture where people feel a need to make men look bad in order to elevate women. You know its possible to show strong, independent women without having to put men down.

Are you afraid of ghosts? I suppose most people would be, but lately it seems that people are much more afraid of reboots, less like reboots and more like big hobnailed boots stomping over beloved memories. 'Ghostbusters' main mistake was a rather unfunny first trailer that suggested that Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy's team up magic had finally spluttered out. The second trailer was much better, but once the naysayers had grabbed on to the first they were NOT letting go, no siree! So the good news for Feig fans is that 'Ghostbusters' in 2016 is almost as enjoyable as the original. A definite reboot and not a sequel, it nonetheless acknowledges the original with some nice touches and a few well placed cameos that serve to pass the baton. Everyone was well aware that they had some pretty huge shows to fill, and obviously put a lot of work in, with the end result a well acted, well written and technically impressive whole.Our four Ghostbusters are equipped with the scariest things known to misogynist muppets – female genitalia! They also come equipped with four actual personalities that are very well realized by the actresses concerned. Standout is Kate McKinnon, who seems to be channelling Tank Girl (wait for THAT to be offered very soon) as a very quirky genius, her marvellous face lighting up the screen as the characters weirdness is allowed to play around on it. Melissa McCarthy is quite restrained compared to her other roles with Feig but does her usual stand up job, with Kristen Wiig the sensible one who seems to have been possessed by Jennifer Aniston. Leslie Jones plays the only non scientist in the crew, but comes armed with a prodigious knowledge of New York and a bagful of sass. The icing on top is Chris Hemsworth, who plays their thick as a donut receptionist, showing a nice talent for comedy whilst he does it.The special effects are what you'd expect from a big budget film today, and the ghosts all look terrific. There's a return for a couple of non human characters that will delight some, and may even bring smiles from the grumpy gits. Children will certainly have a few scares (as in the original), and the script allows for jumps and laughs equally well. Much like the original it has an action finale that by necessity ramps down the humour but even so gives you plenty to cheer for and chuckle at.So 'Ghostbusters' is a really good film. There: I said it. I'm happy to slate a film if I don't like it (I walked out of the godawful new Ice Age film last week) but for most of this I had a goofy smile on my face and gave a few decent belly laughs. The female switch doesn't matter one jot, it only allows you to see four awesome actresses rather than actors. It's wonderful that once again bustin' makes me feel goooood.

Look, this film isn't replacing or trying to replace the original. If anything, it felt like a tribute. I love the originals (have the merchandise and watch them regularly now) and I loved this. The main cast is funny, the nods to the original bring back the nostalgia and I don't think it was trying to be anything more than it was - a funny, great CGI, fun film.As for those who say it's 'man hating' - get a grip. Women taking the lead in a film is a good thing, stop being to misogynistic. I rarely wrote reviews, but to put this article 3.5/10 is ridiculous. It's a good film.

this effort of bringing Feigs vision of ghostbusters in 3d was excellent the best 3d movie I have ever seen surpasses that dreadful jaws 3d from the 80's plus many others that failed but with this it was exactly that the director pictured it when he said that some of it drops over the bottom black bar on the screen and it did and heroes of the hour went to Kristen Wiig and Kate Mckinnon for their action performances to say this film was contrived by certain fans via the media but on the whole I have watched the hell out of it twice in a week and I still enjoyed it and Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones didn't surprise me and Chris Hemsworth rocked it and Neil Casey had an wild ride playing the main villain but all that bad karma towards the fans by shunting them with hidden jokes and abuse towards the no ghost and stay puft balloon by hitting them in the private areas could have left out but on the whole it was great but a shame to the poor turnout thouFRANKIE HOLTZMANN SMALESSMALES TV UK-HOST

The only good thing is Chris Hemsworth. His performance is hilarious but it feels like you drop a cookie into a bucket of spam, mix it all up and then try to eat it. It will still be bad. Its really a shame because I like all of the people involve. But what is this movie even trying to be? The original was an action-comedy whit a little bit spooky on the side. All this remake consists of are unfunny jokes, bad chemistry between the cast, a boring plain villain and truly and utterly abysmal cgi. How can the special effects look worse than the original? If you are going to film everything in front of green screen anyway why even bother with real actors? And don't even get me started about the token black girl. Why is she the embodiment of every racial stereotype about black women? With all the ''a hell naw''s and ''mmmh-hmmm''s? A truly terrible experience.

This film is fun! The four leads do some amazing work and there is some true emotion behind all the comedy. The creative minds behind this film obviously love and respect the original and this shines through in some of the more 'fan-servicey' moments. The villain is not incredibly developed but he is still highly interesting, especially when you consider the fact that he begins as a human and becomes a ghost (a twist on the other Ghostbuster baddies, who begin as ghosts and posses people/find human followers). Paul Fieg makes sure that all four women shine together, making their friendship a pivotal part of the narrative. In fact, by the end of the movie, they feel more like a family than a group of co- workers. And seeing them fire up the proton packs for the first time, truly made me feel warm inside. This film is nostalgic yet fresh, funny yet heart felt and a true summer flick. I highly recommend it! Also Chris Hemsworth is amazing!

Had to go see this since the film had a press blackout, so I, like everyone else paid out too spare you all the pain and money, this film is not good, in truth, it's bad.I really did want to think this would be good, but 4 out of 10 is the most I can give it, the music score by Theodore Shapiro is good, the sound and visual production design are good too, Chris Hemsworth is the only good person in this film, all the good jokes come from him, so there are none really, and this is a comedy?? It's really sad that good talent in film making is wasted on crap like this, behind the scenes that is, but in front of the camera, there is little, some of the worst characters I have seen in in years, horrible and crude, the costume design is a real let down I have to say, only Kirsten Wigs high heels looked good.Thinking of starting a Kickstarter project to get everyone who paid to see this their money back.Avoid this, sorry, I just can say anything else but the truth on this film.

I went into this movie with an open mind hoping that it would not be as bad as the trailers and TV spots suggest. It is. I really wanted this movie to surprise me, to make me laugh to make me care for the characters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to achieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on a beloved classic which has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances I've seen in a while. The computer generated effects were like something out of a live action Disney picture. The music, in particular the theme tune was uninspiring and added no impact or energy to the movie. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film has. After waiting so long for a new Ghostbusters film this comes as a major disappointment. Some things are just best left alone.

I had high hopes for this movie after seeing the backlash against an all-female cast making headlines. But hopes don't make up for flat jokes, forced acting performances and a movie that ultimately takes a very unflattering view of its own fans.The original Ghostbusters movies were marvels of dry wit in comedy. The actors were portrayed very much as a bunch of blue-collar bums, out of their element, and trying to make the best of situations in awkward, and often-times hilarious ways. Every gag shot, for example the classic scene in the elevator when Ray's proton pack is switched on for the first time only to see Venkman and Igon shuffle eerily into the corner away from him as the pack whistles to life is the stuff that belly-laughs are made of. It was dry humor, witty and sharp, and it just clicked. It was simple but sophisticated, and done to a tee by masterful actors.This movie by comparison has all the subtle intelligence in its humor of a Saturday morning cartoon strip. The jokes fell so flat in most cases that it was painful. If the original movies were Calvin and Hobbes, GB2016 is Gasoline Alley. The plot is poor and fairly predictable, with many nonsensical decisions by the cast, and in particular the villain, being directed, I felt, more as backlash against the film's Internet haters than made to produce a quality product. I gave the film a shot because I wanted to see what a female cast of talented comedians could bring to the Ghostbusters universe, in what I had hoped would be a piece at least comparable to the originals. From the absolutely terrible script and stale humor to the cartoonish and utterly unintimidating CGI, it failed.Ultimately, the film also failed the one true test of a good movie: When I walked out of the theatre at the end and thought back on the last couple hours of my life, I did not feel like like the ticket or my time had been well spent. See something else, folks.

Just got back from an advance screening, and not that anyone cares what I think, but if I had one piece of advice for anyone considering whether or not to go see the new Ghostbusters film, it is that the trailers are extremely indicative of the final film. So if you thought the trailers looked good and were funny, you'll more than likely enjoy the film, so have at it. If, however, you didn't like what you saw, I'd suggest not wasting your money, because what you saw is very much what you get. There's no surprises here, folks, the trailers are the film. For better or for worse, depending on your point of view. And don't believe anyone who tries to tell you otherwise.Now personally, I was never all that invested in either side of any of the various arguments or debates that flared up during production, it was just another reboot to me. Hollywood is going to keep pumping them out, so not much point screaming into the wind about it, at least in my view. Instead I just don't bother going to see most of them, unless they actually do show some definite promise, which, sadly, is all too rare these days. And I'm sure no one needs me to point out how poor most remakes actually are, either. In fact, to be honest, I probably would have skipped this one, too, had I not gotten a free invite courtesy of a theatre manager friend of mine to see it. A free film is a free film, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't at least curious, so off I went.So what did I think? Without going into spoilers, I think it's an underwhelming paint-by-numbers mediocrity that will more than likely be largely forgotten about as soon as it is out of theatres, regardless of how much money it does or doesn't make, or what controversies were drummed up beforehand. Neither terrible enough to create too much of a post release backlash, nor good enough to do a very good job of actually providing much in the way of actual entertainment, mostly I just found it rather flat, terribly uninspired, and exceedingly dull. I didn't care about or connect with any of the characters, the story is an ill-fitting frankensteining of old and new, which often don't sit well together, and the callbacks are mostly done in such a pandering way that they actually start to become irritating distractions. To me, it wasn't quite the train wreck that many predicted (and some even hoped for), it's more like the cinematic equivalent of a flat tire, rapidly losing air, making a lot of noise, but really going nowhere fast.Will it make money? Probably. Will it deserve to, in my opinion, not really. Unfortunately it's just another half-cooked slice of Hollywood laziness. Yet another charmless, aimless, factory remake to add to the pile marked mediocrity. Those in attendance at the screening were mostly pretty muted on the way out, as well, so I don't think my view is too far out on a limb here, and I just can't see word of mouth being very positive or giving this much of a boost in the long run. It was just a bit of a non event, really. Rarely managing to be even moderately amusing, and utterly underwhelming overall. Or it was to these eyes, anyway.I'm sure many other people will have many other views, that's just mine.Oh, and just a heads up, but if you do go see the film, you might want to stick through the end credits as well, as there's an added scene at the end.

I only went to see this film as I had free tickets and even then I wasn't sure about going. I was a fan of the original film, but was not sure this would work with a female cast. I also have never been a fan of Melissa McCarthy. However, I have to say I really enjoyed it. I thought Kate McKinnon was particularly funny, but for me it was Chris Hemsworth who really stole the show. The visual effects were not the greatest I have ever seen, but I don't think this particularly mattered. The cameos from previous actors were a good addition. All in all I was really pleasantly surprised. My tip would be to stay right to the end to see the footage after the trailers.

I was rather interested to see a female lead Ghostbusters... There, I said it. I'll admit I had reservations but thought it could be interesting.That all went down the drain when I heard how Sony's Amy Pascal and Feig were bullying the old cast and driving false ideology into the film, still, I thought the cast seems good, Kate's a pretty funny girl.I saw it earlier today and left pretty depressed, I can't believe Feig took some of the funnier women in the business and pulled them down. The movie just... wasn't... funny! At all!The effects, people have been harsh since the first trailer, whilst they are by no means bad, there aren't good either, like a mid- 2000's TV show.The cameos are also forced and feel really out of place, Bill visibly doesn't want to be there and most of the other men in the film are portrayed as idiots bar Chris's character.The story is a mild rehash of the original and it doesn't help itself that it somehow makes the story awful. I won't spoil it but the ending is complete and utter garbage, showing the world that Kevin Feig and Amy Pasal are nothing but colossal sexists.I'll be flying back to the states tomorrow after spending some... Quality family time, watching this train wreck unfold on the big screen. You can be damn sure I'll let people know just how bad this was. It was an insult to the original cast and crew and damages the reputation of the great new cast and I feel sorry they agreed to help make this film.I think we can all hope this ends Feig's career.

I would have given this film a zero, but it doesn't allow comments unless you give at least one star! Ignore Rotten tomatoes assessment. I tried to post my review of ghostbusters, but for some reason my negative reviewed could not post! Funny how positive reviews are allowed though!The levels of sexism in this film are staggering. All the way through not a single male character is portrayed in a positive light! And don't get me wrong I LOVED bridesmaids, enjoyed Spy, and there are many many films with strong female characters. But somewhere along the way Paul Feig has decided that men are the bad guys and he MUST downplay them / denegrate them at all times. Even the boss is destroyed in a way that makes men feel uncomfortable.Now ALL of this could be forgiven IF it was a half decent movie, however it fails there as well!It has many cameo, but they are there simply for the sake, they add nothing to the film and if anything break the flow. I'm not a massive fanboy of the original - I enjoyed it, but not a massive fan. But this is unmitigated garbage. There is NOTHING to recommend this movie!As the title says - AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.

In the 80's GB was huge! It had subtle humor, great quips and one liners. And even some scary scenes! It was played straight and serious and the guy's weren't in on the joke.This film misses that point entirely! The Ghostbusters are in on the joke. Between Patty screaming most of her lines in an attempt to be funny. Making the males dimwits! (Poor Hemsworth) and the ridiculous dancing number by the cops in the later part of the film, and overall cheesy slapstick humor, with outdated references and blatant sexual jokes. You can't tell who this film is geared too. Not kids. Not the adults who grew up with it. Not current teens? Who?You also have the unoriginal concept of the Ghost Logo being a villain, and false nostalgia draw in of having the original GB's come back as cameo's that are NOT even their characters (Even having Ray be corrected on the Who you gonna call bit?) This was a nightmare!They even hint at Zull for a sequel just to keep pushing forward the lack of original thought in this film. Let's not get into the although brief scene in the film of Slimette. You know so Slimer can have a spin off! Maybe with wife and kids! Wait for Redbox or Netflix IMO!

Decided to go and check ghostbusters out today to see if all the hate is warranted and I think it's safe to say that the hate really is warranted !! Never seen so much sexism and racism in a family friendly movie. Not once did I laugh in the movie and not once did it shock me with its it cartoony CGI ... I paid 4 quid to watch this and I feel like I've been ripped off !! disgrace of a movie. I strongly recommend avoiding this film at all costs !!! The cameos were the best bit only just to see the old crew on screen again ! But other than that this film is a stinker and derseves the hate ...4 quid a ticket. And I feel ripped off. That's how bad this film really was ! Even my son did t like it and he loved the originals and he's only 12 .

Boy was this disappointing. I seriously can't believe they rebooted another classic franchise, and not only that, but it was insulting and terrible. Not to mention the politics behind it.Just couldn't enjoy it. Oh, and the special effects and acting was really poor. Lots of hamfisted and "quirky" jokes too that just weren't funny. Not intelligent humor. Kids might like it, I guess.Even the plot was just a rehash, and they didn't even do the ghosts right.I don't know why they didn't just go with practical effects rather than CGI. The ghost ended up being a pretty big guy, and actually I was discussing this film with someone after and when I brought up the ghost they said "for you" and I didn't really get it. Overall it's just completely lacking the charm of the original and feels like a cheap politically motivated Hollywood cash in.

First off this film comes off like the people involved are trying to prove something to serve some sort of agenda. Like, "look, it worked before and we can do it too."With that being said, that may be the biggest downfall of this movie.If you removed all of the Ghostbusters imagery, no one in their right mind would ever consider this a Ghostbusters movie. This is a generic rehash of the classic formula used as a tool to say "we can do it too."It doesn't work. Instead of being all powerful to the female audience, it ends up falling into the abyss of people saying "I told you so."I actually saw people in the theater shaking their heads during the movie. It was awful.There were a few laughs here and there but most of those came from young children laughing at the fat flops and fall downs.I was a bit insulted with the movie and it's constant ignorant view on men.The special effects were a cartoon mindless mess. I'm guessing they were targeting this towards young children, but PG-13 states otherwise.If their agenda was to empower women, they failed miserably. If you want to empower women, come up with your own idea instead of living in the shadows of a successful franchise created by men. You are just mocking yourselves at this point.The story lacked greatly, in fact, there really wasn't one. This is just a rehash of what we remember from the 80's.The whole movie comes across like a group a fans are "playing" Ghostbuster instead of being one.The cameos were meh. It was cool to see a Ramis statue and Sigourney AFTER the credits rolled, but the cameos played no part in the movie.I walked away learning that Sony used this film as a huge advertising platform. The product placement is just INSANE. The movie plays out like one gigantic commercial for Saturday Night Live. That humor may work well for 3 minutes, but this movie was too long to begin with. Blah.Hemsworth was a saving grace and this is coming from a guy. But even then, he and every other male in the movie were made out to be idiots. God forbid men have feelings too and have every right to call out sexism when we see it.The movie was horrible. This just goes to show you that the powers of the studios and their money can market something intensely in an attempt to make a buck and the product is horrible. It's like they think we are stupid or something.Regret seeing it. Wait for Netflix if you are really that curious, or just check out reviews on YouTube. Those have more humor in them than the movie.

Rebooted with an all female lead cast, Ghostbusters is a remake of the 1984 original and is about a group of scientists who believe in ghosts and use their intellect to stop someone from unleashing the paranormal world upon the human world. Now we all saw the trailers, we all saw that dislike ratio (the most disliked trailer on YouTube) and we all saw the negative comments. I can't lie, I did walk into this film hoping it was going to be bad...but it wasn't. Not only was it good, it was actually the most fun I've had this whole summer season of blockbusters. Straight up this is a great cast, the Ghostbusting team have such great chemistry (especially Kristen Wiig, who I am a massive fan of, and Kate McKinnon), Chris Hemsworth was surprisingly funny and even the many cameos from the original. Speaking of cameos, there are a lot of easter eggs in this film that link to the original which many fans will enjoy. I've now come to realise anything director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids and Spy) does, it's just going to be great. The direction was great, the script was funny and the characters had depth. The visuals for the paranormal entities looked superb and the effects for the proton guns looked very similar to the original, which was a nice touch. The villain in the film was underdeveloped and weak but this is only a minor setback. Overall, this is a solid entertaining reboot with a great cast and a funny script that will delight newcomers and fans alike.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com

You have heard all the...buzz about this movie. Abysmal reactions, much hated trailer, and harsh responses by the studio. Pretty much saying that everyone who hates this movie is misogynist is a great defense for themselves. That way, they can blame all those stupid people and won't have to ask themselves whether they maybe simply messed up, big time. It's not about the female cast! It's the fact that this remake was unnecessary. And I can imagine guys sitting at a meeting going "Guys, we need a summer movie for 2016. Any ideas?" "Yeah! Remember Ghostbusters? 30 years ago, that one was a smash hit, and people still love it" "Cool. So there is our idea" "Uhmmm, should we maybe try something new inste..." "Shut up, dude, we are up to something. So what do we do with GB?" "Uhmmm... well, let's replace the cast with all females. That will be enough of a change so that people will accept this simple remake" "Genius, man! Something else?" "Yeah, well, the people loved the mixture of a bit of scariness with some humor by these former SNL guys..." "Cool. But let's add more jokes. Funny stuff, you know? Slapstick and such! FUnny hats! B*tch-slapping someone! Neurotic big city humor!" "Awesome. Now that we have the plot, let's get going".The point is - it's not about the Ghostbusters suddenly all being female. They could have replaced them with aliens, kids, cats, wrestlers or iguanas. None of that would have been a cool idea, or a refreshing change, or a justification to simply remake a film people loved, but make it worse.It saddens me how Hollywood is so out of ideas that they either make too many unnecessary remakes or too many sequels (which feel tired and out of ideas eventually). This movie is not funny. Those jokes might work in SNL, but feel cliché, old, unfunny and embarrassing in a triple A-budget movie. The jokes are predictable, and totally ancient. The characters are tired clichés. The CGI is nothing special. There are plot-holes so big, the Marshmallow man could walk through them without touching the edges. The final battle and the...tactic is embarrassing. I mean, they call fans misogynistic but the big battle is the four ladies shooting the baddie in the crotch? Seriously? Who fought this was FUNNY? Remakes are hard. You need to have a good reason, a "hookline", other than "let's squeeze more money out of an idea a guy had 30 years ago". Why not let the original movie stand for itself? Why not leave it alone, instead of staining it's legacy with a jerkish, unfunny, badly directed, badly written, bursting at the seams with cliché embarrassing remake, even giving it the same name? Yeah, the guys at the studio can keep defending themselves everyone calling everyone who dislikes it misogynists. That way, they don't have to look at the silly, half-cooked mess they created and ask themselves whether this just wasn't a bad idea from the start, and was badly executed. This is just sad.

I wish the movie had just gone for Sharknado or The Room levels of bad, then it could have been so bad it's good. I wish that Sony didn't pay the original cast to lie about the quality of the movie, instead I wish they had gone the extra mile and used practical effects and clay animation for the ghosts. No. Spoiler, this is a cash-grab reboot, pure and simple. The actresses do their best, but there's no compensating for just bad writing. The comedy comes off as several bad Saturday Night Live skits rather than the circumstantial, organic comedy found in the original. Overall, the movie wasn't that bad. It was something worse. It was mediocre, and that's probably the most unforgivable thing your movie can be.

I've never seen the original Ghostbusters films, so I went into watching this with quite an open mind. It ended up being incredibly disappointing though, the CGI was terrible and reminded me of the early 2000s live action Scooby Doo films, the girls, who I'd imagine are funny in their own right, seemed to have absolutely zero chemistry between them and oddly enough Chris Hemsworth's character Kevin ended up being the most funny aspect of the film. That's just my personal opinion however. My boyfriend who I went to see the film with whispered to me 'this is awful,' half way through and he revealed to me that he had felt ashamed while watching the film. I went because he guaranteed me it was going to be enjoyable and I think it didn't take long until he realised that the movie was a disappointment.

The anti-feminist one star reviews on here BEFORE THE FILM OPENED are just sad and pathetic. I'm 35 and love the original Ghostbusters movies and I loved this reboot too.No it will never match up to the Ackroyd/Murray films but on its own terms its very, very funny, creepy in places, great new characters and it's FUN. You will not see a more fun movie this year.The basic premise is that a sad loner who hates women (sound familiar?) tries to raise ghosts in New York to bring about the apocalypse. Struggling scientist Kristen Wiig gets fired from her prestigious job on the eve of a promotion and finds herself investigating a haunting with her old pal Melissa McCarthy. Tagging along for the ride is genius/nutjob engineer Kate McKinnon and wise- cracking subway worker Leslie Jones. Together they must foil said nerd's plan while trying to train hopeless man-bimbo receptionist Chris Hemsworth (who gets some of the biggest laughs in the movie).The plot is ABC but the real joy comes from the interaction with the characters; some of the funniest stuff since Paul Feig's last movie Spy (and Bridesmaids). There are numerous - though sadly brief - cameos from the old cast and plenty of cool new gadgets. My only real qualm was the overly CGI climax but even that was entertaining as hell. Highly recommended. When that opening Ghostbusters beat kicks in it makes you feel 10 years old again :)

The new Ghostbusters is a troubled movie. It can't possibly hold up to the 80s classic, but at the same time it can't possibly be as bad as many predicted (or indeed wanted) it to be. On the plus side, it's no Fant4stic. On the other hand, it's simply not good enough to be above average. Feig gives it a fair shot but only succeeds in showing that he's really not cut out for directing a big blockbuster. If you are in two minds as to see this movie, don't worry you already have. The Entire Plot of the Movie is revealed in the trailers and TV Spots, from the Library opening to the ball blasting climax. Where the original Ghostbusters was filmed, and works, as an actual horror film, this is more Scooby-Doo, played for laughs rather than chills. And that's its main failing. It's played For laughs. The original cast played their characters totally straight. The new cast almost nods and winks through the fourth wall as if to say "Hey, isn't this funny?"Melissa McCarthy is, once again, Melissa McCarthy, although not as much Melissa McCarthy as her recent disappointing solo outings. Her one joke schtick is already passed its sell by date, and even though she works best under Feig's direction, there's no sign here of her expanding beyond the "I'm fat and obnoxious" level of comedy. Kristen Wiig is actually on paper the central character, but her character is so bland she has very little to make her stand out, and is reduced to the straight man for McCarthy and Jones' shouting and slapstick. Kate McKinnon is a comedian/actor I'm unfamiliar with. In the UK we don't get SNL so this was my first take on her. She plays Zany very well. The problem is once it's established she's "the Zany One" you know exactly what she's going to do. Leslie Jones' character is by no means the "token black", like Ernie Hudson, but her performance is So over the top and cartoony (I almost expected her to scream "A g g g GHOST! ZOIKS!" before running away after pedalling her legs in mid-air with a DL-DL-DL-DL sound effect), so obnoxious and so ridiculously, stereotypical "Shouty Black Woman" that even a racist would say "Steady on". Rounding out the team is Chris Hemsworth, showing once again he can pull off comedy, if in small doses. Although completely over the top, the few genuine laughs I had watching this film was from Thor in Father Dougal mode. However, even this started to wear thin after you realised "He's dumb" was the one joke the character served. There's also a nefarious bad guy played by Neal Casey, but his role is so sidelined it's more or less blink and you miss it. Overall the movie is a disjointed mess, with brief glimpses of a good film trying to get out. The library opening works well and is genuinely fun, but the movie drags after that, with a series of flat joyless comedy sketches, that appear to be largely improvised. The climactic battle in Times Square is where Feig's failings as a director come to the fore. He is well out of his depth in a big FX heavy action movie. The battles with the ghosts and the final conflict at the portal are painfully obviously green screen, and the actors' "Look out! There's nothing there!" reactions kill any believability, and wrench you right out of the movie. The SFX/cgi by itself isn't really all that bad, it just seems over done and already a little out of date, like you're watching a film from 5 or 10 years ago. In the end the movie falls flat because it simply tries too hard. It tries too hard to be funny, so there's no wit or charm of the original. It even tries too hard at being respectful to the original Ghostbusters, as every reference brings everything to a halt, not letting the film just be it's own thing, and makes you wish you could just see Ghostbusters 3. All the males - ALL - are either idiots or insufferably condescending douchebags, or a mixture of both. So much so that I think this is an insult to female heroes. What kind of message does the movie project? That women can only be capable if the men are total F#wits in comparison? Then In the end the team blast the giant Ghostbusters logo In The Dick! Symbolically emasculating the Ghostbusters. I could only take that as a giant "F# You!" to the fans who have criticised this project that Sony studios have beaten to a bloody pulp from the original Ghostbusters 3 concept. As to whether they will be granted this franchise depends on the box office. Personally I can't see this movie being anything other than a moderate success. With a budget of over $140 million it may clear pass this post, but I doubt it will surpass it, justifying a sequel and spin offs. On top of that, the promotion and producers and even some of the cast have already alienated the fans they were relying to flood the cinema seats with nostalgia, and the movie itself does nothing to heal any wounds (one scene even blatantly thumbs its nose at online critics, making this film unique in that it actually acts like a bit of a dick to its intended audience). If you are a 1984 Ghostbusters fan you are going to range from being indifferent to outright hating this movie. If you're an average film goer you'll probably be mildly entertained, a good little laugh, but afterwards totally forget what the fuss was all about with no real outstanding memory, like all of Feig's films.

OK firstly I just want to say that yes I am a massive fan of the original movies, but this is in no way a 'fanboy over reaction' as some critics have shouted,this has nothing to do with the fact that 4 females play the lead and nor am I a 'Troll'. This is MY genuine review of MY experience of ghostbusters 2016, there will be comparisons to GB84 but what do you expect when you remake a movie?The movie actually starts off OK, within the first 10 - 15 minutes I thought that this could have promise, but that sharp fizzled out. I went into the cinema with low expectations after seeing the trailers, however I was open minded and hopeful after reading an early review. Reviews at this stage are mostly favorable, well I can tell you now in my eyes (and most others) they are wrong.Despite a relatively strong cast on paper with the exception of Melissa McCarthy who plays.. well Melissa McCarthy in every movie. The movie was poorly written, no character development with a villain straight out of Scooby Doo /Beethoven the 8th/ Home alone 57 (Yes that bad) and CGI that rivals it. Kristen Wiig who I have found funny in other movies just didn't seem convincing and her ogling over the 'dumb but hot' secretary was funny at first but grew old, Kate McKinnon was OK, but again probably just over done, Leslie Jones served a purpose as the knowledge of the city, and with the exception of a few bad lines wasn't too bad, but i'd say the acting overall was below par and the comedy was well... not that funny, it seemed like a dress rehearsal, there was no chemistry, it was forced,and seemed as though they hopelessly fishing for laughs to distract from such a mediocre script.The beauty of 1984 GB, is that the comedy was subtle, sharp and relevant. You believed in the characters and they clicked, 2016 had no direction, we had no straight character to bring them all together (such as Egon), it was 4 people fighting for screen time to delivery terrible jokes. Que the 'dumb but hot' secretary - Chris Hemsworth - Who raised the odd smile, but this was overdone too.The villain was ridiculous, the kind of Villain that belongs in the Spy Kids world,completely unconvincing, we knew nothing about him other than he 'didn't like people' and wanted to 'cleanse the earth'. I was looking forward to the odd nod towards the original, but that was overdone, the cameo's for me didn't really work and served no other purpose than to try and appease the fans, it took away any originality that it could have had.When I first seen the CGI in the trailers I actually thought that looked like the best part, but in truth again this is something that was overdone (common pattern), I get that Feig doesn't have experience with CGI and was probably a little overzealous with it.The movie just didn't have the feel good factor of the originals, part of the romance with the conclusions of these was the sense of coming together and almost wartime spirit, which I think in this day & age would have been great, they certainly missed a trick. But instead we had Chris Hemsworth dance us out, which my 4 year old enjoyed but in truth was just as cringe-worthy as the rest of the movie. I've read up how people have said that it is 'Sexist' and possibly 'racist' I didn't get that feel to be honest, certainly no more than other movies I have seen, yes it is probably directed more towards the female audience but that wasn't the issue here. It'll be easy for Feig and Co to hide behind the 'you want it to fail because its women' tag. The problem is that it is just a bad movie, badly directed with a bad script. Kids may like it, fans of the original will hate it and anyone who is a fan of cinema will most likely just be disappointed. I give it a 2 and I think that is being kind.

Firstly my comments has nothing to do with cast choices .I'm saying this because I saw the interview with the producer that try to justify the bad feed back the movie gets just because the cast has only woman's.What caught my attention was and enormous quantities of dislike of the previous video release of the movie, so I decide to watch any way since this can't tell with the movie is bad or not.The movie itself was an attempt to do an remake write, but in my opinion he fails. Ghostbusters 2016 movie fail to delivery something simple like "fun" unlike the previous one that did that very well.BoSSi.

Ignoring the vitriolic media coverage and backslash to fans isn't easy in the case of this movie. Those who like the movie are getting called 'paid' for their opinion, and those who dislike it are called 'misogynist' and 'sexist'. It got so bad that one can't seriously write about the movie itself without touching on this issue. I just wish those criticizing the negative comments would realize that many women also hate the movie, just check youtube pre/reviews as proof.Now about the movie:It's a wreckage of bad gags, I don't know if it's the fault of the actors or the script. I assume mainly the script and director.There are better MOMENTS in the movie, but the whole movie is overshadowed by 'product placement' adverts The movie is full of references to other movies, most better jokes are also revolving around them.Just as in case of politicians I don't care what their gender is, as long they do their job right, which isn't the case here. If you've seen the trailers you pretty much already saw it all. The only black female character in the team of 4 is a walking bag of stereotyped black women, a racist insult in 2016. The characters are forgettable, the main villain is forgettable, the cameo appearance of the original cast is forgettable and feels out of place. People walking out on the movie when the theater is just half full also means something. Just to clarify: It doesn't mean people leaving are sexist (especially girls), it means the movie is BAD. The movie is a forced caricature and parody of the original movie, there is no need to see this instead of just watching the original movie. All the male characters are caricatures and targets of jokes, it's like a female mirror version of movie sexism. Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz was not an idiot, why did the male version become one? He is still the best character. There is no character development, only stereotypes and bad jokes, did I mention the racist depiction of the only black woman yet?Pixels was far better at grabbing interest with its nostalgia for old things than this ...thing that is definitely just a cash grab. (especially considering the product advertising everywhere) The actors are not that bad, but the script just makes it all terrible, and drags them down as well.tl;dr - This reboot is a terrible parody and caricature of the original movie with bad jokes(?) and an insult to black women. Actually, an insult to everyone who liked the original movies, or the animated cartoon series, or the Extreme Ghostbusters series (which would've been a far better choice for a real, more inclusive sequel movie). There are scenes in the movie which make it feel the whole fan-insulting campaign in the media over the last few months was actually a planned part of the marketing as the movie mocks the fans and original movies more often than not. It will have fans among first watchers of the franchise, many will support it simply for being 'different', and while it's true that many original fans never support a remake or reboot, this won't become a masterpiece even without them just because of genderswap and bad gags. It won't reach the same good review scores as the original.I don't suggest to stay clear of it, but I do suggest to show only the original movies to your children instead of this mess.

Background before the stormI was born in 1983 I had seen Ghostbusters by the age of 5 at least 50 times and I caught GB2 at the cinema in 1989, I had the plastic proton pack the house with the slime, Egon with the pop-out eyes , I wasn't just a fan I was an actual Ghostbuster, the whole reason I became a VFX artist was because of this franchise. but today I got called a sexist pig with no real foundation for criticizing a film , side note most of these people are social justice warriors born after 1995...So last night I took my daughter to rekindle that feeling, perhaps passing on the mantle one would say, 9:15 viewing , good it's late should be a nice atmosphere "8 people in total" - damn this is not good sign.I'll remove my fan tinted glasses for a moment and look at this as a professional artist. Straight off the bat they lead with logo and production title ,wow not even a 10 minute run up, Cinema sins will be raging already..Poor typography and forced into frame. 10 minutes in, looking alright this could be OK , excellent might shut up the internet fanboys ... then it went tits up.Pacing is horrible the cuts start to miss key changes, CGI is bellow par but I will blame time and budget restraints , i'll let that slip for now.damn I should have clocked the red flag that this was going to be a chick flick just from the trailers before the film, Bridget Jones and two Zac Efron films but sweet baby Jesus this went full throttle all that was missing was a tampon hanging from Melissa McCarthy, was that sexist? "good because for the entire film men are portrayed in the same manner. this film is a perfect example of how to stereotype and create further division between genders, it completely had the reverse effect, how black does an actor have to be? Leslie Jones black apparently, all that was missing was a cameo from Chris Rock. SPOILERS: shooting proton packs over peoples head "what?" sorry missed that meeting Slimer and has Wife " what?" don't even start me on the CGI regarding that Shooting the boss in the dick "seriously ?"I'm not even angry , I am hurt that you can take a franchise and absolutely rape it for every penny it's worth even the original cast they somehow managed to make you hate them.I remember walking out of Ghostbusters 2 as a kid wanting to ride the statue of liberty , wanting to be a Ghostbuster , I spoke to my daughter after the film and none of that buzz was there 5/10

I saw an early screening, ice age is a better movie than this (not a compliment)Awful acting , not chemistry between the cast (ironically hemsworth is the funniest one and steals the show).I have seen ps4 games with better fx than this tripe. (think scooby doo movies green screen mess fx)Editing seems rushed and not organic at all.The cameos are cringe-worthy, I really fell sorry for the old cast that was forced to participate on this.Don't waste your money to "give it a try", wait for it on netflix.

Honestly, as the title says, adding the title of Ghostbusters and adding CGI (not even CGI that is mind-blowing for the time) to this movie does not make it interesting, entertaining, nor even suitable to hold the title Ghostbusters. Whereas the original Ghostusters is a massive hit/cult classic, this movie manages to destroy everything the original stood for. Gone is the witty humor, instead forced pandering based on modern feminism, gone are the down to earth characters, including Winston who was a personal favorite of mine, just a realistic man who was helping out; replaced by a large loud obnoxious woman who completely destroyed the original character. The CGI looks horrible, in comparison to the original which had a measured affect on cinema and on fans alike. I could not name one thing that this movie does better than the original, and along with a director who would not listen to fans, and the atrocious forced acting and script, I wouldn't be surprised if the actors denied the ever took part in this garbage.

Before I begin - anyone who believes that this film is somehow empowering or is buying into the 'sexist' narrative should probably research the sub-sub genre. From the moment this film was announced, it split opinion and caused a sensational backlash from all corners of the globe. People sharpened their keyboards and began to form their schisms, based upon their own agendas. You cannot be so naive to think that this wasn't all a part of the filmmakers agendas. Knowing that they could neither add to the GB universe, they took the unfettered approach to attach an idea to the production. Before they even began filming, the producers decided to cash in on the notion of sexism in Hollywood. It is funny how that, for years gone, Sony hadn't tackled this issue (which is an issue), but then attempted to create a campaign for this film that relied upon such a political issue. On one hand, the producers and attached cast bombarded the media with distracting notions of feminism, whilst the fandom (with females included), blasted this film's approach to producing such a cultural classic. You see, this film is a 'boys with toys' film - true, not a properly refined sub-genre, but no less, a product of its time. Fast forward a couple of decades, and you now have a totally different culture of fan. This is the crux of the trouble - did the filmmakers knowingly create a political artefact to open up the cash cow? Or did they genuinely want to create a piece of entertainment for all? - you be the judge. Anyhow, I was 'treated' to an evening tonight to watch this film and whilst it has a few decent scenes - by enlarge, it is exactly what it looks like; a torrid re-boot of a classic that really didn't need it. The cast do not gel in the same way that the four originals did and the dialogue is hammy as the acting. It is like four people desperately trying to show you a representation of the characters of the original - whilst at the same time, using it as a platform for their own agendas. Overall, however, we are left with a film that doesn't know what it is. It looks like a 'Ghostbusters' imitation but doesn't feel like one. It feels, in fact, like a vehicle for the actors involved, and a precursor to a serial of merchandised films that has no real direction, nor story in itself. The scenes begin pretty well, but are tied together with a loose plot that resembles the original 'Ghostbusters', as if someone had to remind them that it is a 'Ghostbusters' film. The music is dire, the CGI looks like it was created in Sony Vegas, and then we have to speak about the third act. The third act is supposed to tie the story together and give us a rounded ending. This however is obviously gearing toward a video game, and possibly a canon of films that will undoubtedly be as terrible as this. There are a number of cameos to give the fans what they want, but they are terribly underused and don't even fit into this world, that... fits into the world of 'Ghostbusters' - confused? I'm not - I fully expect the original characters to be brought back with 'new' actors in order to slap fans in the face one more time, with a "We told you so". Overall, this film is nowhere near as good as the reviews would make you believe - I'm not sure how the producers got this film rated, but the fact that there was a review embargo in place should tell you a lot. In fact, when you read some of the reviews, there is a definite split of opinion - and those reviewers who have recommended it, do so in a half-heart-ed way which is, in itself, a backhanded essence of 'Well, they tried, so you might as well go and see it'. There is no real substance to the reviews and seem biased from the off. If you have a spare ticket or have someone who wants to go and see it - I would suggest that you let it go. Not only is Hollywood now resorting to politicising an issue that does not need politicising, but they appear to be selling us an idea that this is somehow good for the female equality movement of Hollywood. But the action, story and dialogue are somewhat spawned from this notion and this leaves a terrible taste in the mouth. So to summarise - this is no more Spice Girls, than it is All Saints. Anyone, any actor, any director would have ran into the same issues that, at the end of the day, plague this film. The core issue is that, it is a film that has been made for all the wrong reasons - with Paul Feig in the corner, plying some notion that this will somehow empower the gender issues within Hollywood. I spent the entire time wondering how on earth this film got made - it is bewildering to think that anyone thought this would be a good idea. However, as long as it sells and it gets merchandising deals, then I guess that is seen as a success. I gave this film a 3/10 - because I will certainly not be forced to 'answer' any call (which doesn't make sense at all).

I give this movie 5/10 because there are many negative things that I think a Hollywood movie with that high budget is allowed to do, yet there are many professional and positive details that makes my review stay on 5 and not go lower.The story doesn't seem pretty realistic and interesting. Photography is very professional and I love it. Casting is amazing and their work makes audience emotional. Special effects and CGI is good but not the best. Makeup could've been better, especially on the female actresses. Honestly I would like to direct this movie, I think I would've done it better. It can be rated as 5/10 because it has its own pros and cons.

First, a huge thank you to Paul Feig. You did not ruin my childhood and in the process, made a great film, I have had time to process and am ready to post. This weekend I attended the red carpet premier of Ghostbusters. My impressions are below.The movie delivered for me and I really enjoyed it. It was not a rip off of the original as the characters had their own development and style. They were busting ghosts but with a different purpose and with a distinct protagonist that is different from the original with a different purpose. It worked well. The first 10 min were the only tough point for me but only because the movie had to start and find its stride. I saw it in 3D and it really was awesome. The 3D was not just an afterthought. It really added to the film and made me feel a part of it. The audience I was with were all hardcore ghost heads and fellow busters. The mood during and after the showing was positive and energized. I heard lots of laughter and support. None of the people I talked to or were there with booed or had a negative reaction. Most can't wait to see it again. My biggest complaint is that I have to wait until Thursday to see it again. Great time was had by all! Finally, some will hate no matter what. I went to this film expecting to be let down. (Sorry Paul) I was in fact pleasantly surprised. I loved the film. I can not say it enough. If you honestly give it a chance, you will enjoy it. I know this film will grow a next generation of busters!

I really enjoyed the movie - I laughed at the jokes. Hemsworth stole every scene he was in. Kristen Wiig played 'straight' perfectly with Melissa McCarthy as the friend dragging her back into the 'paranormal' world. Loved Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones performances. The film flowed well, at no point did I feel bored. The CGI was fine - obviously not going to be scarily realistic ghosts as its going for the family feel rather than thriller.Don't understand the hate this film is getting. I would never compare it to the original as I don't feel it is meant to be a continuation of it, more of paying a slight nod of homage to it whilst standing on its own. I went to the cinema to be entertained for two hours and I was.

The obvious issue with this movie is that it is an unnecessary reboot of a classic which has been a beloved part of our lives for 32 years. If the original source material does not stand up to the test of time, remake it if you have to...but Ghostbusters 1984 still hits the mark.GB16 admittedly was not as bad as the trailers implied, I fully expected to give it 1 star, but it is bad.The good points: - the music: the good news is that that terrible Fall Out Boy/Missy Elliott concoction makes only a brief appearance, I was pleasantly surprised by the use of the original song - the cameos: we all wanted to see the original cast return in their previous roles of course, but the cameos were done well I thought (except for Bill Murray's, his seemed very strained) watch out for the bust of Harold Ramis, a nice gesture but I think the homage to Harold in the Lego Firestation HQ is far more poignant - the Firestation HQ cameo: it was great seeing it on the big screen again although I never want to see the pole used in the manner suggested by McCarthy! - the supporting cast: Hemsworth and Garcia in particular were quite solid Hemsworth had some good lines and the times I did utter a laugh were down to the supporting castSo basically most things I thought were good about the film had to do with the original and appealed to my sense of nostalgiaThe bad points: - bad script: 95% of the jokes were not funny, the story line was poor, the main bad guy was lame with no real explanation as to why he did what he was doing or how he knew how to create inter- dimensional portals - the main cast: why the original movie stands up to the test of time is mainly due to the characters who feel real. The main cast in this were caricatures, overt stereotypes with no real likable qualities - the weapon testing scenes: slapstick comedy at its worst! - the constant referrals to their sex and race - unnecessary, we can see you're women so we don't need reminding by referrals to your breasts and 'cracks' - the toilet humour: I'm childish enough to laugh at a fart still but when you rely on this type of humour in a summer blockbuster and in a reboot of a movie so revered as GB84 you're doing yourself no favours: to then take it a step further and make a fan*y fart joke, the tone of the movie is just shot to pieces - the CGI: the ghosts looked as bad as they did in the trailer...the original 1984 effects were way betterThe tone of the movie felt similar to The Watch (but not as good, and that wasn't brilliant, although I liked it!) It's a film most will watch out of curiosity like I did, it exists now and that can't be changed it could have been a bit worse but it could have been a whole lot better in the right hands

I saw the original and the sequel back in the 80's. Both of them were good. If your a fan of the original, don't waste your time or your money on this one.But whoever thought of creating a reboot of Ghostbusters needs to be sent to a lunatic Asylum or Exorcised. Because it was crap.Apart from the special effects and cheap rate gags in it. It doesn't have a great deal going for it. Some of the original cast are in it, but they only play cameos along with other celebrities.A couple of things I did find funny was having Mr and Mrs Slimer driving Ecto 1 as well as the Marshmallow Man in the shape of a balloon.Don't get me wrong, I think having a female cast as the Ghostbusters isn't a bad idea. I felt as though it focus far too much on the comedy (asuming there was any) and far too much CGI. There was hardly any story, in fact it was just boring.My advice would be stick to the original Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters 2 (1989) and avoid this one like the plague.Harold Ramis must be turning in his grave and would properly rise from it as well, if he ever knew just how crap this one is.

Is really sad that in 2016 there is still people hating all over the internet only because is a team of 4 women. If you are a parent go watch this movie with your kids, show them some gender equality and that woman can also be heroes and strong. Critics already love it. What top critics say: The freewheeling and funny solidarity of the four leads win out in the end, even if Feig shows more timidity than he did in Bridesmaids, The Heat or Spy. Crucial to the fun: McKinnon, who steals the movie with her mad-scientist grin, eyes that gleam like a laser pointer and unexpected random weirdness. Jones, McCarthy, McKinnon, and Wiig are so good together - and in ways that are distinctively theirs and not recycled from the past - that their message of not giving a damn resonates better than the movie's underwhelming climax.

First up, the question on everyone's minds (no, not where Elvis is and how he's doing) - is it as good or better than the original? The answer is no, but not much is. Ghostbusters is a fun, energy- filled film that, while it doesn't capture the lightning in a bottle of the original 1984 film, does have a personality and energy all its own. Rather than replace or recast the original four characters, Feig's Ghostbusters opts to go in its own direction while also giving winks, nods, and even proton blasts to the gut in references to the original film. The cast is wonderful with Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones being the stand-outs. Production design and visual effects are absolutely incredible showing what a Ghostbusters film in 2016 can and should look like to perfection. The ghost encounters are creepy, the combination of visual and practical effects selling the illusions quite well. Theodore Shapiro's score is also a whole lot of fun, helping balance the creepy with the heroic. The film is not without flaws, the third act happens rather quickly and you can't help but wonder if a few threads to help get you there were left on the cutting room floor. The visual spectacle takes a front seat and the comedy and tension get a little left behind, but the action in the third act is so kinetic and fun eye candy, you don't really mind. This could have easily been a cynical cash-in on intellectual property, but instead is a reverent, well-intentioned and sweet film that does what comedy does best: play absurd situations with complete sincerity.

This is my first review. I'm not a massive fan of first two parts. So I was not crazy about upcoming reboot. It happens that I was on early screening. And I must say that as for a reboot this movie was so sexiest....so feminist with plenty cameos with sloppy jokes. I will come with some small spoilers just to give some best example including part of ending. ----Spoiler----Why does it happen to be that all guys in this movie are idiots?Mayor, delivery guy, Hemsworth was funny but they make him play idiot. The only guy who was smart it was a villain!Even in a final fight, thy shot that bad guy in his nuts!It's like this movie is promoting Girl Power and feminism. Also cameos..it is not just with actors but things from previous movies for example words like "I ain't afraid of no ghosts" was said by Dan Aykroyd cameo.----Spoiler----Instead of some cheap jokes this movie should have some adult sense of humor. More connection between girls because it was missing. First two parts I was watching 20years ago and I still remember them but this movie will be forgettable. Overall as for me, movie is only worth to watch on TV screen with kids on Sunday morning after Scooby Doo....

This movie proves two things about Hollywood: 1. They are out of ideas 2. They love to ruin childhoodsNot a single joke from any of the main four main actresses landed. The only funny character in the movie was Chris Hemsworth. AND HE'S NOT EVEN IN THE MOVIE THAT MUCH!!! The special effects are mediocre as hell for what's supposed to be a summer blockbuster. The movie contradicts itself TWICE and it comes to a grinding halt every 15-20 minutes to make a reference to the original source material to try and save itself, which it fails miserably at. And every single male character in this movie is either a complete idiot, an outright douche bag, or an antisocial weirdo in the case of the villain. This wouldn't be a problem if the whole marketing campaign was built around how "all haters are misogynistic men." The hypocrisy is REAL.Ghostbusters 2016 is an unfunny, hypocritical mess of a movie.

Yes, there's been a lot of negative things that have gone on with the making of the movie - the most notable of which is the highly toxic labelling of men who detract this movie are Trump supporting, basement dwelling, spouseless, sexist man-babies - just like with James Rolfe - and the additional removal of constructive comments on the trailers of this film. Jokes on them; I'm English, I don't have a basement, and I did film courses at school and University so I know what I'm talking about.For the reasons I've listed, my hackles were up going into this movie. But, to this films credit, my expectations were beaten, as I did get a couple of good laughs. But as a whole, the movie is a mess. Here's why: Firstly, the largely improvised script takes exchanges that would work better as a one liner and stretches it until it breaks, and then keeps going i.e. the "cat out the bag" argument at the Mayor's office, or the Patrick Swayze segment. Additionally, characters do some dumb stuff. Case in point, they catch a ghost, then purposefully release the ghost who ends up killing Bill Murray's cameo (one of only two deaths in this apocalypse). The ensemble cast is poor. Individual characters are well acted; the two best BY FAR were Kate McKinnon who plays Gillian, who's the group's bonkers, quirky, hyper-active engineer, and is the most likable one of the four main women, and then there's Chris Hemsworth playing their moron receptionist, and he gets some AMAZING lines that had me belly laughing. The whole cast is poor - they don't mesh naturally, and some of them are REALLY poorly utilised; Michael K Williams of The Wire and Boardwalk Empire is in two scenes, goddamn Charles Dance is in two scenes and used even less, and the main four don't mesh at all. And that sucks, cos I think Melissa McCarthy is one of the best comedic performers around right now, and Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones are good too. I mentioned the casting, there's one that comes off really badly. Neil Casey plays Rowan - the villain. This guy is a stand-up, who gets NO FUNNY LINES AT ALL. Seriously, why? And his performance, and character is literal Sh*t. He's awkward, uninteresting, unthreatening and completely unfunny. The character dies at the beginning of the third act, and later shifts into the bodies of Melissa McCarthy and then Chris Hemsworth, and then he becomes a lot more threatening. Why give a stand up no funny lines when you have Michael K Williams and Charles Dance who would've taken that character and done something great with it?Other issues include CGI, which was awful, especially towards the finale, one terrible Ghostbusters metal remix on the poor musical score, and dumb characters decisions. But, despite all this, McKinnon and Hemsworth made me laugh. Well done to those two. And to Paul Feig, I adored Spy and Bridesmaids, I'll view this as a one-off screw up.

Director Paul Fieg teams up yet again with Melissa McCarthy and a Saturday Night Live line up cast which follows trend of the original 1984 cult classic. Being a female reboot, you try to figure out who's respectably who; is McCarthy Ramis and Wiig Murray? Each character having similarities while still oozing something new. The person who stole the show was SNL regular and TV comedy personality, Kate McKinnon who resembles Ackroyd's Ray, only a little more crazier and somewhat crankier to full comedy effect. Another SNL regular joins the team, the giant Leslie Jones who I reckon would make a great celebrity death match for Game of Thrones Gwendoline Christie. Andy Garcia plays the mayor but is nothing like David Marguiles' mayor from the first. And Chris Hemsworth's Kevin as an answer for Annie Potts' Janine, playing a dumber than dumb partially blind and deaf receptionist. I think they actually doped him up before takes. Neil Casey, yup, another writer from Saturday Night Live, plays the bad guy nut job who's going around waking all the spooks up. I think I preferred it when Gozer came to town. It's a very similar story, with some interesting tweaks for background paying respect to the originals. The old famous Hook & Ladder Company #8 building makes an appearance, along with Ecto1 (though missing the annoying yet lovable siren) Slimer and his nasty appetite and the usual proton-packs with upgrades. The Stay Puff Marshmellow Man gets a facelift and the cameos are brilliantly placed but no Moranis.Theodore Shapiro does the score but gets sounded out by the soundtrack, which is actually a lack of and its been reported Ray Parker Jr. isn't happy with Missy Elliot and Fall Out Boy's rehash version. There's no Mick Smiley's Magic or Laura Branigan's Hot Tonight. Same premise as the original, possibly playing to fresh fans, this might do what the '84 classic did for us oldies, (middle-aged) and should it matter if it's an all female cast? It's funny with some very good moments but unfortunately there's plenty of mediocre comedy that just doesn't hit home. It's a little longer than the original and it does feel it in parts and the effects are what you would expect, they're good but nothing really mind-blowing that we haven't already seen before. Seeing a lot of hate, and low scores and to be honest, being apprehensive and a big fan of the originals, it's a good reboot, its a carbon copy yes, but how else would anyone expect to make a reboot and the fact the film pays so much respect to the originals and especially with the cameos I find it hard to hate it.

I am not a "hater" by any stretch of the imagination. I am a fan of the Ghostbuster franchise, loved both the original movie and the sequel as well as the animated cartoon show. I went to this movie looking forward to a refreshing new take on the Ghostbusters and was very disappointed with what I got. Firstly, let me say that I'm not a GB fanboy/fangirl by any stretch and I'm not comparing this Ghostbusters to the original because it can't be compared. I wanted to see four powerful, smart and funny females rock this movie and show the ghosts who's boss. Sadly, despite my high hopes, this movie fell flat. Kristen Wiig's "leading lady"-ish when it should have been Melissa McCarthy as the lead. Kristen's jokes were stale and the same jokes I've seen in dozens of her past movies, nothing particularly new or funny about it. Melissa McCarthy I felt was just a toss away in this movie. Why she wasn't given more lines, more starring scenes, I'll never understand. Perhaps because she's not an SNL alumni? I don't know. I felt like she was vastly underutilized and it's a crying shame because she is comedy gold in my eyes. They didn't use her enough. Her scenes that she did have a bigger part in, were funny. Kate McKinnon was great in her role. I see her becoming a new comedic lead and I honestly really love her and Leslie Jones from SNL. They're both very funny women but I feel like they weren't given enough room or a good enough script to let the comedic genius inside them shine bright. The movie apparently attacked anti-feminists before coming out and angered a lot of fanboys and I wasn't one of them but as a female leading movie, I think it was in poor taste to constantly bash men in the movie. I couldn't stand the guy who played Thor in his role and the overall anti-male tone of the movie just didn't sit well with me. You can be funny and feminist without constantly beating up men with jokes and remarks... The original Ghostbusters didn't sit and cut down women, why the new take on it with an all female cast felt the need to bash men just baffles me. It distracted from what could have been a great movie. If they replaced all of the man hate with jokes and maybe even a storyline ala Peter and Dana, perhaps with Kristen Wiig's character and male, it would have been a much better movie. Let's be honest, a lot of the content/premise was taken from the first movie but switched around a bit and less funny. The hint to Zuul in the after credits scene had me cringing. If they do a sequel let's hope for more laughs, more jokes and less hatefulness in the movie. It was just too much bashing and too little laughing for my taste.

I got to see an early screening last night and I AM HAPPY. I walked out of that theater absolutely swooning with love for those women and their characters, and with my stomach and face hurting from laughing and smiling. Of course it's not a perfect movie; what is? But I'm dizzy with joy that something so fun and funny and showcasing so many talented, amazing women (Leslie Jones was the highlight of the movie, in my opinion). It made me laugh, it spooked me a little (the ghosts were downright creepy!), and it made me care about the characters. It paid tribute to the originals without just being a direct rehash - it was a love letter. Yes, Hollywood, please keep making movies that are about more than just straight white guys. There are other people out there, and they deserve to have stories about them, too.

The last time I laughed this much at the theater was while watching Ted part 1. The jokes are razor sharp and quick witted, and they deliver. Kristen Wig is hilarious in this and Leslee Jones brings the house down with a few of her one-liners. Chris Hemsworth shows that he has a great sense of comedic timing, I hope he sheds Thor for more roles like this. The story is somewhat familiar to viewers of the original film. but there are enough new twists to keep your attention rapt. The special effects really help capture the mood in the movie, and some are hair- raising spooky.A wonderful summer movie that brings the fun, the funny, and the entertainment. Go see this: you will leave the theater with a sore face from having a smile stretched across it for 2 hours.

Fans rejoice! The new Ghostbusters movie is not, in fact, the childhood crushing disaster that some feared after less than seller trailers, but a colourful, extremely fun, very funny romp of a re- take on a classic. One that spends just the right amount of time paying sometimes cheeky, but always respectful homage to the original (with fantastic cameos from all of the living original cast) without being a slave to it. It cheerfully moves with its own style and its own brand of humour, which is consistently delightful thanks to the very genuine chemistry of the four leads. Each character is distinctive and quirky and the ghosts are purposefully stylised in a way that lends itself well to the bombastic tone of the movie. There are gadgets and techie jargon to satisfy the nerdiest of fans, and a surprising amount of scares.Of my few complaints, one would be that the villain is noticeably under-developed in a way that is detrimental to the plot. While this complaint could also be levied at the original too, it feels more noticeable here. This also creates pacing issues which are problem from act 2 onwards and the emotional climax of the movie, as well as the weight the stakes hold for the Ghostbusters personally, suffer for it. But these problems are pretty secondary when you're laughing so hard. Ghostbusters is nothing like a cynical cash grab, with Feig and his cast's want to entertain their audience evident in every frame.A quick note on the biased mess this page has become thanks to an unfortunate few: As you can probably tell from the paranoid tone of many of these reviews, they don't seem particularly balanced or fair. This would be because they aren't. There has been a concerted effort from people who are angry this movie exists and is reviewing well to bombard this place due to its more open nature. It's amusing that there is a conspiracy theory among these people that there is foul play from Sony with this movie reviewing so positively among professional critics, when in fact there are organised downvote campaigns from people who have yet to actually SEE the movie! So no, you don't need to take these people seriously. As you can see from their paranoid claims that Sony are secretly paying-off critics to give this movie positive reviews (a technique they've apparently forgotten to utilise for any of their other more expensive movies, which have been panned critically this year), these are just the last trashing of a small but vocal group of adult children.

And it's good. I went into this not expecting much and was totally thrown off my guard. The movie was actually quite enjoyable. The humor, which in some very brief moments felt a little much, was very balanced with the story and the creepiness of the ghosts. Anyone who judges this movie based on what they think they know or what they saw just in trailers will really miss out on a good movie. It was a lot of fun, the story was actually good and the little bit of fan service and self deprecating humor were well placed. It is definitely worth checking out. I will also add that I think the 3D for this is worth the extra money and that theme song everyone was so enraged about is only in the movie itself for less than a minute total.

This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and trust me - I've seen a lot of bad movies.You probably saw an Adam Sandler movie once and thought it couldn't be worse. Well, guess what this is on a whole other level of unfunny.Keeping in mind that we're in 2016, the special effects were god- awful. If you have ever watched a sub-5.0 Sci-Fi TV-Show, this should give you a hint of what kind of special effects you should expect. I'd say the directors would probably have been better off hiring my 14 year old son, to do some CGI in Adobe After Effects for a few hundred bucks.The fact that the movie has all female main roles, is not a problem for me. But the fact that every man in this movie is portrayed as either an incompetent idiot or evil, while literally every female in the movie is portrayed as a hero made me want to walk out after the 20 minute mark.!!! SPOILER !!! The movie ends with Melissa McCarthy shooting a big ghost in the groin. This should tell you what kind of anti-male humor you should expect throughout this movie.The fact that any director in the world, would invest just 10 cents in this movie, makes me wonder whether they're in it for the money, or just want to turn their career into a suicidal defeat. I wouldn't even recommend you to watch this movie ironically. Only watch this movie if you have literally nothing else to do, and by this I mean you'd probably have more fun watching a newly painted wall drying.

...The cinema who made me pay for this crap for my money back. Honestly, I was actually kinda looking forward to seeing Hollywood open up a new female lead genre. It should have been used to show cinema goers and children and women and men that it's OK for women to be leads. I hate this movie. And don't say because I am Male that I am automatically sexist. I genuinely feel sorry for Chris Hemsworth and Sigourney Weaver and Bill Murray and all the talented actors and actresses who were involved in this monster. The Script is awful. 40% of the lines are Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig rambling and bickering on and on and on... 20% is Leslie Jones' Stereotypical Loud Mouthed, "OH HELL NAWWWWWW" Patty. 15% is cameos from Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson,Dan Aykroyd,Sigourney Weaver and Ozzy Osbourne. 15% is Kate McKinnon's weird remarks which leaves you sitting there debating whether to awkwardly laugh or to sit there and think "OK....." The other 10% is lazy unfunny sentences. The acting is appalling. These are talented people and to go and make them do this is just wrong. The CGI reminds me of Grown Ups 2's Deer. This was a movie made to reboot a classic franchise into a more modern era. It just ends up being sloppy and all girl power with no real power.In the words of Comic Book Guy. "Worst.Movie.Ever."

Ghostbusters 2016 is fun. It is NOT a sequel to the original, nor does it carry the same tone the majority of the time but it shouldn't be expected to. And it proves pretty early on that it doesn't need to. As a huge fan of the series, I breathed a sigh of relief and wore a giant grin about 20 minutes in when Erin, Abby and Holtzmann celebrated their first ghost sighting with so much passion because I shared that excitement. This film was going to be good and it was.It's not without it's fault; some jokes fall a little flat here and there and the villain doesn't really get enough screen-time. At it's worst it feels like a Ghostbusters fan film but that's nothing to be ashamed of because it is. Positively brimming with love for the series, Ghostbusters 2016 pays homage (and parody) to it's history maybe a little too much but it ain't afraid to do things differently. The characters have a surprising level of depth to them, the story is logical and well-paced and the whole film is gorgeously colourful (interesting, considering the ghost are far more menacing).Ghostbusters 2016 is refreshing and exciting and I'm glad to say I enjoyed it thoroughly. Perhaps people on the internet need to shake it off and try enjoying something once in a while.

Loved it - although it could never be the original for me - as I was 14 when the original was released.All five main actors have great moments, and even if it is not without flaws (the last ten minutes?) - I laughed harder with this film than I did with any other comedy since Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy's last one.I saw it with three 13 year old girls and a 10 year boy, and they absolutely adored it - laughed loud and hid behind their hands in all the right places.So - highly recommended - and really saw it (Leeds UK - 11th July 2016), unlike the majority of people rating it on this site. Worth 10 stars? Not quite - but I think in this case it's acceptable...

Ignore the dull troll remarks. Yes, it differs hugely from the original made some 30 years ago, and yes it does indeed have a predominantly male cast. unapoligetically bold in its difference, whether in its more modern approach to SNL cast treatment, or production design elements - it holds strong narrative parallels to the original, yet embarks on a very different endgame, albeit a lighter tone throughout.It is not a third Ghostbusters movie, nor a rehash which happens to have women in it. Its totally on its own, in a good way. The concept of Ghostbusters and the generations it has inspired as an idea is not owned by us children of the 80's anymore... And this is the product of a different era of comedy (love it or hate it), and a well refined one. I look forward to the sequel.

Ghostbusters is directed by Paul Feig and stars Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones & Chris Hemsworth.Following a mysterious ghost invasion in Manhattan, a pair of paranormal enthusiasts, a subway worker and a nuclear engineer band together to stop the otherworldly threat from causing chaos across the city.After many years of waiting, the Ghostbusters franchise returns with a new set of heroes and a colourful special effects palette that provides exciting visual eye-candy along with an almost perfectly and tightly wrapped script. Cast members McCarthy, McKinnon and Wiig bounce off each other wonderfully and deliver some amusing remarks to certain scenarios throughout, especially with Hemsworth's witty and utterly useless persona, which is hilarious. Unfortunately, the writing for Jones' character wasn't so satisfying. A lot of the lines fell flat and ultimately sank underneath the energetic performances by the aforementioned.Now, although I haven't always been a fan of Feig's work, I admire him for taking on such a huge project. I believe he has done an admittedly average job with the direction and writing, but most of the critical reception and fan backlash, while overwhelmingly ludicrous, is an unfair representation of what is shown in this movie. Coming to the realisation that comedy and target audiences alike can change over the years, is something that will give you a fair advantage over the other viewers heading into this world. I genuinely believe, like any movie, that everyone should watch for themselves before shooting angry comments at the filmmakers or the people that enjoy the work. This is one of the reasons I bought a ticket to see this movie.The other reason was the special effects. After watching the trailers, I noticed how vibrant and diverse the visual effects were. This is one of the stronger points that really hold the experience up, it's consistently colourful and fun to watch. I'd like to see it in 3D and judge how this contrasts over the two formats, maybe making a difference to the overall enjoyment of the movie.While these comments make it seem like I'm hugely impressed, or that it's a high-flyer, there were certainly a few sections that were disappointing. Firstly, the villain wasn't very good. He felt forced and extremely obvious from the beginning to end. I'm not sure whether this is due to the writing of the character, or the actor Neil Casey, but I didn't like it. Secondly, the 'finale' section during the last 20 or 30 minutes of the feature felt loose and lacked in the comedy from the previous hour and 20 minutes. It seemed very lazy and didn't make any sense, feeling anti-climatic, which is not the reaction you should get from a finale. If this was improved upon, it has the potential to be a brilliant end to this story. Finally, and most surprisingly, the cameos were poor in contrast to everything great about this movie.Music by Theodore Shapiro is sparse and compositionally simple with mostly predictable directions in string movements, along with the horror/mystery flick genre that was expected. There aren't many cues or themes that jump out at you, and whilst that's usually not a bad thing, I felt it lacked from the overall experience. There is, however, a lot of songs by various artists that are thrown in throughout. None of these were pleasing to my ears and I felt could they have been removed without any deterioration to the quality of the movie.The production, special effects & set design teams along with the art department have done a wonderful job with their time. Most notably, the new Ecto-1 is amazing to look at. Every angle or scene this vehicle features in is a blast to watch. I imagine fans will be looking to buy replicas or even construct full-size functional versions to bring to events in the future.By this point you're probably still debating whether you should bother buying a ticket to see this movie. Maybe you're still not convinced. Or you don't want to upset the butt-hurt any more than they already are. To that, I'd tell you to just go for it. Do it in secret if you must. I simply think everyone should form their own opinion before calling people out.In retrospect, it's a fairly enjoyable flick that put a smile on my face and took me out of the real world for a couple hours. There are a few scenes I thought were out of place and fell flat in the comedy aspect, but I really didn't have a terrible time watching it. Maybe all this backlash served as an expectation that could be easily beaten? Who knows, but I liked it. A personal highlight for me was McKinnon's performance as Jillian Holtzmann, which was great. I'd not seen her in much before this so it was a nice introduction to her work. I thought she came across genuine and seemed excited and pleased to be a part of the franchise. All of her action sequences (especially in the finale) were handled well and came out to be some of the best parts of the experience.My verdict; Ghostbusters is a fun, energetic and visually awesome take on the franchise and I'd happily sit through it again. A sequel, though seemingly doubtful, wouldn't be so bad in my books. Don't take it too seriously.Ghostbusters, 6/10.

This movie really draws a line in the sand between those that want to see authentic organic movies and those that feel movies ought to adhere to some politically correct agenda. I read some reviews on this site of people who fully admitted to not watching the movie yet gave it ten stars because to them this is a vote for PC and feminism. I'll be honest the movie stunk and I wish I hadn't wasted my time or money but I was one of those folks who felt the need to give it a chance for the sake of fairness. It stunk for many reasons which most of the other reviewers have aptly pointed out. My problem with this movie, which gets to the heart of the whole authentic vs PC problem, is that they wrote the characters to be the female equivalent of the original male characters and it just does not work. You can't force a square to be a circle anymore than you can force a female actresses to behave as if she was a male actor. In an ideal world they would write an original script that brings out the creative talents of the four actresses in this movie because they are actually very talented in their own ways however when it comes to attempting to behave like some bad ass dude they aren't able to pull that off. I would love to see more empowering female led action movies but done in a unique way that doesn't simply rip off all of the traits that male actors have in action movies. There is nothing wrong with portraying realistic female action heroes that acknowledges their biological femininity and play off those strengths.This would be far more refreshing from Hollywood and would require the script doctors to actually earn their pay but I am not holding my breath given the current state of focusing solely on reboots, remakes and endless sequels.

It has been just a little over 24 hours since I saw Ghostbusters, and it still haunts me at how awful it was. I wanted to give this movie a chance, tried to see it with an open mind, but alas it did nothing. When the first 5 minutes is the only slightly good part and only me and possibly other ghosts are watching in the cinema, you know it's going to gives you shivers.Where did it all go wrong? Could the concept of the Ghostbusters being all women work? Well, maybe(?)... if they hadn't been written so annoying and obnoxious for me to give two craps about them. Let's make them have no funny jokes and whine all the time! The new secretary guy? Make him dumb and have all the women get the hots for him, oh and plenty of failed jokes one after another to go along with that too.To be honest, the CGI isn't that great. I think the 1984 original had superior special effects. Oh, and the theme song? Way to go at ruining the iconic theme guys! What about the original Ghostbusters? Don't they appear as cameos? Yes (and this isn't a spoiler)... for like a minute each! What a waste! Any positives? Well, I guess you could argue it doesn't play out exactly the same as the original, except that's pretty much cancelled out for everything being written worse and reminded it's supposed to be a Comedy.I adore the Ghostbusters franchise, I really do. Ghostbusters II gets a lot of hate, but it truly feels like a masterpiece compared to this abomination. If you can't give us characters to care about and not be likable or redeemed, why bother? Yes, some of the original Ghostbusters were jerks, but they all had a heart as well. Where were the laughs? Why change the iconic things about the series? You know what? Just stick with the Ghostbusters Video Game as the last Ghostbusters, and pretend this so called Ghostb... I mean Ghostjokers never existed.2/10

I really enjoyed this film. Some great cameos from the original cast and some great gags and they aren't slapstick silly gags they are cleverly done I guess you could say its a bit girly since there are girl main characters but there were plenty of guys in the cinema watching it and they seemed to be enjoying it. Each of the main characters has their own personality and so everyone can have a favourite. I guess if you take this movie seriously then you will be disappointed by why would you? the first movie wasn't some serious drama, it was a light-hearted film and this is no different. You should go and watch this movie, you wont regret it

I've heard the arguments of all sides. feminists are mad, other people are crazy, other people and liberal feminists are liking this this movie and DMCA people who do not share their viewpoint.. In short I've seen the whole soap opera surrounding the "new ghost busters".First let me congratulate the cast for doing a great job under extremely difficult circumstances ( like horribly bad script, hey even brad Pitt or Sean Connery couldn't make this movie look good with the current script). There were some funny kind of slapstick jokes in there but overall the script was guano crazy (not in a good way). yes there are stereotypes in the movie but hey its a movie! Watch and enjoy ( though for me, the horrible script ruined the experience). That said the cast was great but the bad script is what ruined the experience and the movie for me.CGI is also not the best and the colors seem to belong on a cheap China toy. Sigh another disappointment .. kinda. Now the movie isn't all that bad as some anti ghostbusters ( current movie) make it out to be. It all depend what you expect of the movie. Is it the same witty zingers as the original ghostbusters? No. Is it entertaining? That is something you have to decide yourself. I found it OK ( that is why i gave it a 6/10). Is it worth seeing in the movie theater or waiting until it is available to stream or on blue ray? I suggest you all wait until it appears on netflix, hulu, prime or other streaming services or even if you want to spend money on it buy the blue ray. In my humble opinion it is not its money's worth.

When Harold Ramis died so did the notion of Ghostbusters 3 ever getting off the ground. Columbia Pictures instead rebooted the film for a new generation with a whole new team of female Ghostbusters and nods to the original such as Marshmallow Man and Slimer.Of course some people on the internet have not been too keen on this version from the get go. However the film is self aware of the backlash as Melissa McCarthy's character takes note of the YouTube video comments: 'Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts.'This version takes a while to get going after a spooky pre credit segment. McCarthy's Abby Yates plays the co-author of a ghost book who has been tracking the paranormal phenomenon for years. Kirsten Wiig's Erin Gilbert who also co- authored the book wants her spooky past forgotten as she strives for tenancy in academia.However when ghosts start to show up in Manhattan they spring into action along with Kate McKinnon as Jillian Holtzmann, an expert on tech gadgets and Leslie Jones as Patty Tolan, a transport worker who joins the team as the only non physicist as part of the new Ghostbusters and mirrors Ernie Hudson's role in the original who also the non physicist Ghostbuster.The final segment was full on Ghostbustin but it was also too much filled with CGI in a sound-stage that was a replica of Times Square from four decades or so. I felt something was off in the editing of that segment only for it to show up during the end credits.The original Ghostbusters was a mega hit back in 1984 but the sequel under performed with the critics and at the box office.This reboot is not bad, the plot is thin and McCarthy and Wiig rein in their shtick a bit. However I felt McKinnon tried too hard to be quirky. Other people have found Chris Hemsworth's turn as the male bimbo funny, I thought it was rather annoying.The film has the stars from the original Ghostbusters popping up as if to give it a seal of approval but although it has some genuinely spooky moments it is short on comedy.

I was a bit unsure about seeing this as I loved the original, but I really enjoyed it. it was a silly, fun, funny film. I laughed all the way through and so did most of the people in the cinema. It's not exactly going to win any Oscars but it does what you expect - passes a few hours in pleasant, escapist entertainment. Lots of nods to the original without just being a copy. Cameos from original cast; the main leads were all great.Melissa McCarthy, who I love, was a bit more restrained than normal, and played well off Kristen wieg. Loved Chris Hemsworth as the dumb blonde secretary. Ending was a bit weak but these type of films usually are. Stay for the credits too. Ignore the reviews and go and see it if you enjoy simple fun without looking for any deep meaning.

Since the movie did not have the best reviews i was not sure if i wanted to go and watch it in theater. It's a shame it didn't get better reviews.I am so glad that my sister dragged me to watch this movie because i loved it!!! It was hilarious.This is the type of movie that I can definitely watch over and over again and still not get tired of.The women acted really well and had me laughing throughout the movie.Most importantly, the movie captured me right from the beginning. I would recommend this movie to my friends and family for sure.So don't worry and go to the theater for this one, I am certain you won't regret it.

To begin a review for this film with 'I don't hate this film because it's got women in it' is the sexist's equivalent to 'I'm not racist but'. Does this film deserve the 10 stars I'm giving it? Probably not. But does it deserve the barrage of 1 stars it's receiving from hundreds of aggressive men? Absolutely not, so I'll stand by my 10 stars in the hopes of evening the playing field; fight aggressive hatred with aggressive love. The film is funny; it's easy to watch, it's enjoyable, and it's very much in the same vain as the original. It's respectful of the original, and it's nods to it (though overt) are pleasant. None of the original cast needed to appear in the reboot for financial reasons, they had cameos because they wanted to and have faith in it. The pedestal the original movie had been placed upon is excessive and damaging; it was a good and enjoyable film but it was by no means the definitive piece of art it is hailed as by many basement dwellers. It was funny, easy to watch, and enjoyable. Which just so happens to be the same qualities as the reboot possesses. The cast work well, they act well, and they mesh well together. Chris Hemsworth's character is far more naturally funny than I originally thought he would be, and the characterisation of the women, though falling into a variety of well-used tropes, is interesting to watch. If the reboot had the same plot, the same villain, the same special effects, the same writing, and the same director, but four male leads, the vast majority of the poor reviews and insults thrown at the movie would not be present. If you keep obsessively and aggressively telling yourself you don't hate the film because of the female cast then you need to take a step back and recognise that these leading ladies aren't the problem here: you are.

Having seen the trailers I can honestly say I wasn't expecting a great deal, however I went along anyway to see what the full film would add to the rather damning trailers.Unfortunately the film really didn't hold very much water, it had the 4 actresses which didn't really gel together with the chemistry not really hitting the mark. We had every single male character portrayed as either a complete moron or as creepy or as some kind of evil character.The jokes in the film were not very funny and the stereotypical lines given to some characters were offensive to say the least. To top it all off if there wasn't enough sexism and gender bias in the film already, they then had the final boss being fought by you guessed it being shot in the groin.Overall I think this film has been a huge disappointment. Every time a film gets given the opportunity to make use of female talent in a positive way, all we seem to get is a massive over reaction by feminist writers to spread hate, sexism and stereotypes. Is it any wonder so few people want anything to do with feminism these days when this is the type of film that gets produced when directors listen to them.The Heat (same director) was also guilty for a lot of the same flaws this movie and even ironically ended with the same sexist attack with the villain of that film being shot in the groin as well.I genuinely hope this film suffers as a result of the sexism and a lesson is learned here.

I recently saw the film at a cineplex near me. I am a fan of the originals and will admit my original misogyny when I heard they were recasting with women but after seeing the first two promos I was mildly swayed and decided to give the new film a chance. I admire the angle that this film was made at, they wanted to appease old fans whilst paving the way for future movies. I found the movie overall very funny with the funniest parts being throwaway lines and even found Chris Hemsworth very funny a lot of the time. I also rather enjoyed cameos from the various original cast of Ghostbusters in what appeared to be polar opposites to their original roles except from Annie Potts playing another loudmouth receptionist. Whilst I was disappointed that Rick Moranis didn't make a cameo (I thought he was dead) I am happy there was support from the original cast with Bill Murray and co. Overall I found the film to be very pleasing, consistently chuckle worthy and gave a nice nod to the original.

This film is as bad as people thought it would be. Don't believe the positive reviews that have been bought and paid for.Warning some spoilers ahead.The first Ghostbusters HQ is a Chinese restaurant and they don't get the firehouse until the end. Chris Hemsworth becomes possessed in the film and becomes a villain. There are brief cameos by the original cast but they are not playing their old characters. The whole film is basically a really bad SNL spoof of the original 1984 Ghostbusters. The comedy is forced and not funny. The special effects are a huge disappointment considering how much money was spent on the film. All the talk about feminist man hate is true, which explains why the Ghostbusters are women now. Honestly this film is for feminists and all that support the "girl power" movement. The film only uses spoofs of the original Ghostbusters to make a quick buck off people. Save your money this film is a box office dud.

Look people, it's not a bad movie. Everyone is complaining how it "won't be as good as the original", and let's be honest: it wasn't. BUT, it was a good movie. No one can deny that. It doesn't live up to the original but if you think that it's a bad movie you better keep it to yourself. The main thing is that the original cast were the funniest, and most loved people in the movie business in the 80s. These are theoretically the same people, but they are females. What's the big deal? They are as funny and loved as the original Ghostbusters. I recommend to all you haters to go see it and watch it as if there was never an original Ghostbusters and maybe you can enjoy it more. There's no guarantee that you will love it, but if you get out of your head that it's a bad movie, then maybe you can enjoy it the way it deserves to be enjoyed. But hey, haters gonna hate. :|

They shot it in the bits!That line both speaks to how the final big bad ghost is brought down and also to the film itself. The creators of this rubbish absolutely shot this film in the bits with this script. It's so bad, and not the 'so bad it's good' type of bad, it's just utter rubbish. Maybe Americans will like this brainless, insipid, and funny-only-because- it-sucks-so-bad film, but no one I talked to leaving the cinema in Watford actually liked this, and it's not getting very good reviews from anywhere in the UK or Europe, except from those married to the 'not liking it is sexist' narrative started by the Americans. Well, I'm a woman, most of my friends are women, and none of us who went to see it together actually liked it. Best rating from any of us is 4 stars, but she was a bit sloshed before it even started. Breaking it down: Script: 1/10 (the script written by a computer algorithm was better than this)Acting: 3.5/10 (not really the cast's fault...they were brought down by the script)Effects: 2/10 (seriously, even the original Ghostbusters was more believable than this. Why did they have to make this look so horrible and obvious green-screen is obvious?Score: 1/10 (will leave you thrilled to get back out into the world and listen to traffic)Casting: 4/10 (this cast just didn't mix well, not even close to the great casting of the original)Plot: 0/10 (you can't set up a premise in the beginning of a film just to throw it in the bin and go another way later. What happens in the middle and end of this makes no sense given the premise set up by the original film and the beginning of this film)Politics: 3/10 (obvious man-hating is obvious...could have toned it down more than a bit, yeah?)Paid £13 to have my brain attacked by this horrible remake. Don't waste your money. Go to the pub like a normal person and enjoy yourself.

With all the melodrama surrounding this movie, I figure it's important to disclose my mindset. Since criticism of this movie is being deflect with ad hom attacks. I don't really care about casting choices. As someone sign up with MoviePass I usually go to every movie. I also enjoy listening to movie podcasts. I'm of the mind set, let's judge a movie by the actually quality of the final product. The trailers had me alarm, but maybe it because I'm getting old it's rare for a trailer to get me excited. I think Prometheus was the last trailer to get me hype, but it could of just been Riley Scott returning to the Alien series.None the less, to get on the topic. Ghostbusters 2016 threw away every good about the original Ghostbusters and replace it with a lack of chemistry and actors mugging the camera. I've sat here for 15 minutes trying to think of a good quality about this movie and I simply cannot. The best I got is Chris Hemsworth is attractive but they made his character an imbecile. In the original Ghostbusters the secretary was an intelligent women who stood up for herself who had the classic lines, "I've quit better jobs than this" and "Ghostbusters, Whaddaya Want?!"The main difference between the originals and the 2016 was 2016 knew it was a joke and treated it like a joke. While the originals had goofy yet believable characters in a "possible situation". With Ernie Hudson playing the straight man that everyone could relate to.The 2016 there is little justification for these characters to be working together, they are not "goofy" they straight up one dimensional making the characters dull and uninteresting, and the way men are portray is flat out insulting with no redeeming qualities(at least Bond movies the girls are smart/skill/sexy).If you have children, I beg of you. Please let their first experience of Ghostbusters be the original Ghostbusters movies. I love those movies as a little girl and they help inspire my love of science and started me down the path towards engineering.Thanks for reading my review!

Is it Earth-shattering bad? No, it's nowhere near as bad as everyone thought it would be. However, it's definitely not good either.The first real joke of the movie was a generic fart joke. That's what kind of movie this was. I'll be honest. Chris Hemsworth may have been the funniest character in the movie. which totally disappointed me.The good: It was a lighthearted, goofy, "something-to-do" movie. I would not recommend paying to see this at the theater unless you're going with children (and even then, there is too much crude adult humor to be comfortable with that). I did end up liking some of the nods to the original Ghostbusters film, though they did have a LOT of them.The bad: They are really milking the sexism thing - Immediately following a surprisingly cool fight scene, we hear some forced joke about how women are always late. Ugh. They clearly want to continue the dialogue about the casting (any pub is good pub, I suppose).The cast was surprisingly out of sync at the beginning of the movie. There was no real chemistry or flow between the leads. It got better as the movie went on, but it was kind of choppy at first.Did not like how Leslie Jones' character was portrayed. The loud and black one that isn't as smart as everyone else. I'm tired of it, and that type of wacky character wasn't needed at all -especially in this film. I would have preferred one rational person in the group instead...someone the audience could relate to. Overall: It was okay. Like the title says, a mediocre summer movie. I had a couple of chuckles. There were some eye-rolling moments to balance them out. It's something to check out on Netflix one day. In my opinion, it's not worth going to the theater to pay for unless you just want to relax and watch something goofy. I can see how some would like it, but most probably won't.

I really, really don't get all the hate that this movie is getting.I went in with preconceptions like most people, and during the first 10 minutes, these didn't seem to alleviate. But as the film went on, I got into it more and could see it for what it was - a fun, entertaining film.I think the casting was spot on. Kristen Wiig's awkwardness was done well, as was Melissa McCarthy's brashness. But for me, the stars of the movie were McKinnon and Hemsworth. They brought a real humour to the movie, and both in very different ways. Chris played the un- intelligent male secretary very well, and showed me a side of him I'd not seen before. McKinnon, I had not seen at all, and I thought she was brilliant. Her mannerisms, jokes and timing were spot on, and had me laughing on multiple occasions (let's not forget she's cute as hell, too). I also enjoyed Leslie Jones' character, again, adding good humour, I could tell from the scene in her subway booth she was going to be good.Is this movie perfect? No, not at all. The cameos were forced (Ozzy), and there was some dialogue and scenes which weren't great (I didn't really like the shooting in the crotch or buddy saving scenes), but I still think this film is solid, and entertaining. What more do you want from this film? The CGI was good, especially the big battle in times square. If you want to enjoy this movie, DO NOT go into the film even thinking about the original Ghostbusters movies. There is just no point. It is not the originals, and it is not trying to be, either.Go into this movie with the intentions of wanting to see a a fun and entertaining movie, and take it for what it is, and I have no doubt you will enjoy it.

There's an hilarious moment in the new Ghostbusters movie when the all woman team are presented with suggestions for a new corporate logo by 'Kevin' their himbo receptionist. The first is a female ghost with a frilly skirt and large breasts. The design doesn't meet with approval, so Kevin suggests that he could make the breasts larger. The gag is typical of the knowing, self-referential humour of this new movie which even pokes fun at internet reaction to the news that this remake would have an all female central cast. Only the most glum at heart could nay-say this remake of the now 30- year-old original. Ghostbusters movie. A smart comedy adventure, it revamps the original movie and has its own feel good mood that left the audience that I saw it with in fits of laughter. Ghostbusters hooks you in with some nice one liners - a haunted house from old New York is said to come with an authentic anti-Irish fence The central cast comprising Melissa McCarthy,Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinno spark off each other and keep the action bouncing along. The plot is sort of new and although the central villain, a hapless janitor, lacks the interest of the originals geek and Gate-Keeper pairing of Rick Moranis and Sigorney Weaver, the film holds the attention with fun references to the original - the new team can't afford the rent on the fire station HQ of the original team so have to settle on rooms above a Chinese take-away: cue running Wan Ton Soup gags. Some commentators have found the film restrained but if that means there are less fart jokes then so much the better. There is a point where action takes over from humour - a Thrilleresque dance routine involving the Mayor and the emergency services is cut and moved to the closing credits presumably to better feature the accompanying promotional song and not bring the climax to a jarring halt but it seems like a waste of a spectularish set piece. The cast have taken misogynistic criticisms with surprisingly good humour. And now the film's actually on release, they are gaining a better press. This is the feel good movie of this Summer go see it and prove you ain't afraid of no girls!

It's sad that I can't review this film without the context of the preceding "controversy" surrounding its release. Where have all these 'die hard' ghostbusters fans come from? The original was great, sure, but let's be honest, for most of us it's a very enjoyable 'spooky comedy' rather than a life changing holy grail of cinema. So the overstated enthusiasm for the original at the time of writing is fairly exhausting.I'll keep it short.The film 2016 was impressively consistently funny, as evidenced by the numerous collective belly laughs in the cinema I attended. There were some misses too, much in the way an episode of, say, Family Guy has hits and misses, but the laughs outweighed the troughs. Actually, in terms of the audience's reactions to the jokes, I'd go as far as saying it was more consistently funny than your average episode of Family Guy (which has loads of misses all the time). Obviously the humour and style is different, so don't take that comparison as an absolute. But Ghostbusters 2016 was very funny in places.The film triumphed over the pre-release criticisms that this was pandering to feminism. The issue didn't cross my mind at all. The characters and the actors were enjoyable. There was a decent explanation to all the ghostbusters' reasons for being part of the team. You'd have to enter the cinema wanting to be annoyed at this for it to actually be an issue. I'm a 28 year old male, by the way, as ridiculous as it is for me to confirm that.The film isn't great though. It starts strong and, somewhere mid-way, begins to approach its climax clumsily. Things go from 'investigations' to 'total apocalypse' very quickly and get resolved equally quickly. Also, all the throwbacks to the original end up feeling forced and a bit awkward. It would be better without the cameos. The failings of this film are not linked to its pre-release criticisms.If you want to have some fun, like you would when going to see any comedy, then this is worth your time. If you have low expectations, give it a chance and you will probably enjoy yourself.

I am a massive fan of the original films. They were a big part of my childhood, which is the case for a lot of people. When I discovered this was a reboot I was, needless to say, disappointed, angry and upset. That was just me being a complete fanboy. I finally accepted this and eagerly awaited the release of the first trailer. Like so many others I was gobsmacked at how shockingly bad the trailer was. It was like an SNL spoof. The pacing was all wrong. Up until seeing the film on its first day of release, I was still very much 50/50. Who wouldn't be after watching THAT trailer? I saw the first showing at a local cinema because I couldn't handle the anticipation.I'm so glad I was pleasantly surprised. What a relief! The film exceeded my expectations. Within the first 5 minutes it felt like a Ghostbusters film. It was fresh, but familiar, in terms of pace and tone. I was worried this was going to be the Melissa McCarthy show, which works for other films. Each character had equal prominence and was great in its own way. Together they had excellent chemistry and were believable as ghostbusters. Nearly every line was funny and there were so many little quips that were easy to miss. I loved the storyline and the nods to the originals, including the cameos, were a lovely touch.

When the announcement of a new Ghostbusters movie was made, fans had back-lashed and trolled on the internet and social media on how this was going to be bad, then things just got worse when the trailer arrived (it went on to become the 12th disliked video on YouTube) further dragging the reboot to be a successful one. But having finally watched it from my own eyes with my mind set off the reality of working life, I will honestly admit and truthfully confess that this reboot was actually better and not as horrible as people made it out to be.The comedic performances of the leading cast were good, with Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Chris Hemsworth and Kristen Wiig being the standouts on performance and comic delivery. The cameos and nods to the original film were present, but interesting enough that this reboot can stand as its own movie as there is no past mention of the characters involved in the original. The cameos from Murray, Aykroyd, Weaver and Hudson are all enjoyableThe direction of Paul Feig was great as usual, having already established his style of comedic storytelling with wedding comedy 'Bridesmaids', female buddy cop flick 'The Heat' and the surprisingly entertaining and hilarious take on the spy genre 'Spy' but the humour this time is often subtle and never relied heavily on gross toilet humour which is a good thing for me but depending on how you like your comedy films you may want better or more.Overall, the film will get more of a bashing and trash talk out of than praise but I am giving it a positive review for it as I was entertained throughout and I think this will be an underrated or even ignored film for the generation. Just hope it's not a box office bomb in the coming weeks, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again or even get a sequel maybe.3.5/5 - NickWe both grew up watching Ghostbusters 1 and 2. They were both entertaining and charming in so many ways. It captured this amazing comedy/Horror that made it a world wide success. Sadly, for me, and for millions of other people in this world this movie didn't do anybody any favors.When the trailer was released it became the most hated and disliked trailer ever in youtube history, and that's saying a lot! While I definitely would not say I hated this movie, it definitely didn't work for me. It had its moments of charm and humor, and eve scariness, but the cast and the situations they put themselves in just seemed lazy and you could almost every time when they were in front of a green screen. The magic wasn't there. Even the final showdown (while entertaining) wasn't long enough. It had nothing to do with them being female...it has to do with the fact that it wasn't the original cast. Even if you had different male leads it still would've been hated. The original cast just captured the magic.All in all, it wasn't a horrible movie, there are many references and the film makers giving tribute to the old ones, but I simply didn't like it. It didn't work for me. Hemsworth also was really bad in this one. 4/10. 1.5/5 stars. Jay

Ghostbusters is far from a great movie but it does not deserve the hate it received. The plot follows four women in New York that band together to save New York from the supernatural. The overall acting is alright no outstanding comedic performances but I do think the actresses on screen had great chemistry. To be honest I did not laugh that much while watching the movie. Lots of the jokes are loud and in your face but the few funny ones are subtle and quiet. The most praise-worthy thing I can say is the movies pacing. I cant remember any time during the movie where I was bored.It kept moving like a film like this should be doing. My negatives with the movie were ( like i said) was the script and that I didn't find myself laughing that much and I had one small issue with Kate McKinnon's character. Overall I enjoyed my time with the movie and I was really surprised. Is it great? No. Is it awful? No6.8

It saddens me deeply that this movie has been surrounded by such blind hate from people who refuse to let go of the old ghostbusters and act like this film is the most offensive thing on the planet. Produced by Dan Akroyd and with cameos from almost all of the living ghostbusters, had this film not been poisoned by overly sensitive people on the internet it would have been a hit.The four leads display a wide range of personalities, from the nervous Erin (wiig) to the committed believer (Abbie) to the weird and quirky Holtzmann (Mckinnon) and the hilarious Patti (Jones) these are a set of 4 female characters that - unlike many movies we see - are focused on a scientific goal and not once do they have sex with someone (shock horror!).If you are reading this and do not understand why this is important then I doubt I will convince you by the end of this review, but I would be grateful if you were to listen to my opinion. Girls do not see this. This is not something that happens often, and it's important for women to see this.Special mention goes to McKinnon's character the engineer Gillian Holtzmann, who is not only strange, intelligent, gloriously weird and dressed like a post apocalyptic mad max-exque lesbian, but participates in a fight scene that made me understand why guys like action movies. Not once had I engaged with a fight scene the way I did watching a normal woman absolutely kick arse in one and that's the truth. (Also the gun-licking may have been a minor bisexual awakening)The humour of the movie matches a modern equivalent of the old ghostbusters, following the path of casting many Saturday night live alum, you can tell that many of the funny moments were improvised by the cast. Another special mention goes to Chris Hemsworth for his comedic delivery as the hilariously inept secretary Kevin, who covers his eyes when he hears loud noises. The rest of the humour is a combination of witty back and fourth, loud observational and sometimes just plain gross (it's a movie that involves sliming what does one expect) with a classic Paul Feig spin. To conclude, ghostbusters was a well done, funny, and groundbreaking movie that is absolutely not the horrid flop the internet wanted it to be. I would highly recommend it, in the large theatre I was in, I heard roaring laughter at every turn so do not listen to these internet commenters. Real people in the real world loved it, and I'm sure you will too.

10\10 this boring, basic, run of the mill Paul Feig film that pulls no stops hold your attention just enough to keep you awake. The experience was akin to watching your parents do taxes, or enduring Chinese drip torture. Something I particularly enjoyed about the film was when they had a character comment on every action any other character would do in a sympathetic tone and expecting the audience to laugh, because "ha these girls are so goofy just like you and your girlfriends. i mean we all empathise right hahaha. Go make this into a gif and share it all over your facebook relating it to your own sorry sad lives".Overall, it's top of the pops. I don't like scoring systems?? because games journalism? righto goodnight. ly.

Like a good movie fan I gave the controversy a very wide berth. Wide eyed and innocently I sat waiting for something fresh and hilarious(kind of like the originals).The first bit was promising, but then it just turned into a sea of derivative pandering cliche's. The humor is awkward, contrived and lacking. Even Melissa mcCarthy(whom I loved in bridesmaids) was a massive let down. This is clearly aimed at fringe feminist elements, and probably not die-hard fans. I felt like I was watching impostors doing a bad impersonation. If Hollywood was trying to make some kind of point they failed miserably. It did not resonate with me, and certainly not with my husband. By the time the inevitable gratuitous shot/ kick/ punch to the jewels had arrived he was cooked and ready to leave. Its a bit like a chef who only eats her/his own cooking, refusing to get any objective opinion.Normally I don't bother writing reviews, but I feel cheated. This was not worth the money we spent. How could they get it so wrong?

I honestly thought it was *alright*. Not great, not bad, just alright. I mean I don't have a problem with the gender swapping, and I was legitimately looking forward to this film after the first trailer. Shocking I know. Some of the jokes hit, and others were misses. An enjoyable romp. I could point out many of the little flaws, but in a film like this, it really wouldn't make a difference. Editing was a little choppy and amateurish. CGI was pretty distracting. Felt a bit rushed. I wouldn't see it again, but I enjoyed it while I was there. If there's anything this film made me wanna do is call the original Ghostbusters. I suggest you check it out, with an open mind. You might enjoy it. An enjoyably good 6/10 I would write more, but that pretty much sums up my thoughts. It was alright.

So I was went to see the movie I loved the idea of female leads and nytimes said it was a good movie. But boy , nothing can prepare you for this beast, It was such a bad movie this was the first time I witness more than half of the people just went home after watching 1st half an hour. And I am demanding you nytimes, Please give me my money back.It was such a bad movie even for a die hard ghost busters fan, I need some eye bleach please. Mr. Feig and Katie Dippold you failed us in big time. And I found it sexist against men specially they are targeting male genitalia , all of the men appeared in this movie are either stupid or a villain.

It comes as no surprise to me that a movie that selected on the lines of genitalia instead of merit was as large a disappointment as this one.I went ahead and gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched it with an open mind but it really is just a terrible movie that tarnishes the franchise.It is the Ghostbuster series Diablo 3: A forced iteration likely conceived by marketing executives instead of creative individuals. The product ends up being an uninspired, watered-down version of the original. Selling out a beloved series to make a quick buck.

Before I get into specifics which may or may not contain spoilers, I want to get this out of the way. Younger kids will enjoy the new movie. There are a lot of things going on, goofy moments, and other things that kids like. I foresee the movie being a good way to introduce new toys and other merchandise that kids will want.With that being said, as an adult and a fan of the originals... trying to take the bias thoughts of being a fan out of the equation, this is not a Ghostbusters movie by any means.This movie plays out like a poor parody of The Ghostbusters, and would have been better served by not taking on the namesake and being marketed as a similar movie in the same genre with a similar story. I was literally sick at my stomach during and after the movie to even think this could be associated with the original property in any shape or form.THE MOVIE: This was a forced comedy with forced winks that were unclever and honestly gave no addition to the enjoyment of the movie itself. Too many aspects of the movie were overkill. From the overabundance of CGI and non interesting ghost, to a new forced joke every few moments, I found myself just sighing.I feel like the director wanted to really wanted to create his own vision but felt that if he didn't force everything upon us it wouldn't sell. That is where he made his mistake. The backstory, what little bit there was, was boring and skipped over anything that could be remotely entertaining.The nods and forced comedy were mediocre at their best. The overall storyline played out in what was a disappointing first act, alright second act, and very underwhelming third act in a movie that seemed to go by quickly, but not quick enough.THE ACTORS: I LOVE Kristen Wiig, Melisa McCarthy, and Leslie Jones. All three of those women are terrific actresses and very funny.Just not in this movie.Kristen Wiig was annoying. her character made me sigh every time she opened her mouth and the role was just so irritating I kept hoping she'd just be killed off. I feel as if she was supposed to be the Peter Venkman type of character for this movie, and they failed horribly.Melisa McCarthy's characters was annoying and immature. The jokes they had for her were some of the most forced and her true comedic performance could never shine through as she delivered what I can only imagine were lines she just wanted a payday for. This is by far the worst role I have ever seen her in and it may have turned me off of her for a while.Leslie Jones. Type-casted from the start. She plays the same role she ALWAYS plays but damn it, I wanted something different this time. I wanted her to take this major role she's been given and give us something we haven't seen before. The writing for her... man... I would have rather they kept her part down to the size they gave Ernie Hudson in the original movies than force her to be so up front with how ridiculous they wrote her. She was bland, not funny, and quite sadly given a "token black character" role. Shame on you Sony. Shame on you.Kate McKinnon. This is the one person I was NOT familiar with at all going into this, but also the most interesting of the 4 core actresses. She played her character amazingly. The little things she did and how she delivered her lines were just entertaining and felt organic. If there is a stand out performance for the movie, it's this woman.With that being said, the supporting cast was more entertaining than the main cast (sans Kate). Chris Hemsworth was great and gave me a chuckle a few times during the movie. Bill Murray's cameo was good but too short lived. And nice nods to the other originals.Except for the main bad guy and the tour guide who started the movie out. Those guys annoyed me every scene they were in. Terrible, TERRIBLE acting. The characters were horrendous, and I think they had a major part in ruining the entire movie experience for me.THE NODS: The nods to the original were good, but mostly forced as previously stated. Bill Murray was the best of the cameos, Ernie Hudson was only in the very end with a very predicable role, Dan Akyord was just a few moments and felt out of place with his dialogue. Nice to see the original actress to play Jeanine as well as Sigourny Weaver. That was quite a surprise for me. The Staypuft Marshmellow Man cameo was great.Too many other forced nods. The theme music played like 5 different times in 5 different ways. The firehouse was forced, just none of it needed.OVERALL: Do not pay to see this movie. Wait till it's on TV or Netflix. Or take the kids to it. If you do go to see it, go in with the thought process its another bland comedy but in a ghost catching genre. Do NOT go in with ANY expectation that this will come close to touching anything in the Ghostbusters universe.

I got to see this film last Monday and tbh I was quite hesitant going in on how it would be.I am a big fan of both original films and the old 80's toon, that aside I found this film quite enjoyable its no way going to be a Shakespearean masterpiece so if that is what your expecting you should leave that thought at the door.I know a lot of people have criticized this film for its lack of practical effects but I though the initial Ghosts that appear in the film where well done. there is a few scenes later on that have many appear on screen so they tend to be not too distinctive.but tbh thinking back to the originals you didn't see that many on screen at the same time also.I will admit I was not impressed with Chris Hemsworths character Kevin I felt he was just to over the top for comic relief as the other Characters did a good job of keeping the humor going throughout.The main villain of the movie was interesting to say the least with out giving away any spoilers.All in all I found this movie to be very enjoyable and it shouldn't be dismissed just because it isn't a continuation of the original films.

Non-Spoiler reviewFirst off, I'd just like to get this right out the way: I genuinely believe the majority of positive reviews are by paid shills or bots, as ALMOST ALL OF THEM came the same day in a very narrow time period, some before the movie was even released. And yes, I am being 100% serious, in saying that. When Movies have to have huge profit margins, this should be expected, especially given the unprecedented negative reaction to the trailer. I find it incredibly odd that professional reviewers have rated this movie an average of 6 stars, when the average fan voting barely exceeds 2. Only conclusion I can think of is the reviewers were either bribed or were too afraid of coming off as sexist.Let me also say, that I feel I am a rather open minded viewer, with no real nostalgia to the original GB. I have enjoyed female cast comedies before, and Bridesmaids is one of the dozen or so movies I've actually purchased in the past few years. This is not bridesmaid however. Remember in middle school when everyone in the class had to do a presentation, and the two weird girls who were overly sheltered and for some odd reason loved horses got grouped together and tried WAYYYY to hard to make it funny? This is that same feeling of cringe and secondhand embarrassment, only for nearly two hours.I'm not even going to go into the blatant sexi... err I'm sorry, Feminism Counter-sexism, or the incredibly awkward and played out Racism where the one Asian and one black character are literally walking caricatures, and just stick to some of the laziest stereotypes I have ever seen, but instead focus on the worst part of the movie; It simply was not funny. Cheap and crude laughs are easy and annoying, but they do occasionally at least make you smirk, but I can say with absolute sincerity that this movie did not make me do anything but mildly smile once. The CGI was terrible, most of the actresses genuinely felt embarrassed to be there, and the plot was beyond boring. Look, we all knew what this was, no one expected Casanova or an Oscar winner, but if you're going to be crude, at least own it.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was certainly one of the most boring and forgettable ones. My only concern is when this movie flops horribly,and it will, that people don't play the sexism card to excuse it and kill the possibility of the next "bridesmaids". This was just a bad movie, and no actor, no matter how funny they were, could save it from it's poor writing. Blaming the poor writing on misogamy is lazy.

This movie was not asked for,it isn't very funny,and in my opinion takes away something from the original movie.All it tries to do is cache in on nostalgia from the first movie. The humor is forced and very more miss than hit. At almost 2 hours, I spent time just looking at the time, wondering when it would end. The cringe comedy is not my idea of funny, and the delivering of the some lines sound like the actresses don't want to be there. I am all for gender equality and female roles, but I don't really want to sit in a movie that is just there for the sake of being a female remake of a movie.

I get that a lot of the criticism (besides the VERY obvious 'I haven't seen the movie but I'm going to say that it sucks because it triggers my personal issues" type "criticism") is that it won't compare to the original. And I have to say, I re-watched the original and it just was not as good as I remembered it. I think sentimentality skews your perception quite a bit. My opinion is that this movie really is about as good as the original, it's just that the original gets more of a pass for being... well, original. So with that, I think this reboot had some strikes against it from the get- go. (As well as the aforementioned weird vendetta stuff that somehow made this goofy movie into a supposed feminist conspiracy. Dang, I must admit the entertainment of that was probably the best advertisement any movie could ask for.) That aside, take this movie as what it's meant to be -- it's just a simple, good time. The story is not original. It's not cerebral, "Royal Tenenbaums" type stuff. It's not an Oscar Wilde- inspired parody. It's an unpretentious fun summer movie you can see with the family. Yes, there were a few jokes that seemed juvenile (just like the original) and some that missed, but all in all I'd say you will have fun and smile a lot,and the characters are ADORABLE. I gotta wonder what all the negative fuss was about. hmmm..

"Now You See Me" is has a wonderful cast and story lines that surprised and charmed me. I already know that I want to see the film again to scrutinize the misdirection that pervades both the on-screen "magic" acts and the overlaying plot lines.The film has three principal sets of characters--first, the illusionists who are brought together by an unseen force to build a spectacular act, including at least one bank robbery, played out on location in Las Vegas, New Orleans, and NYC; second, law enforcement, including the FBI and a lovely French Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent); and third, the observers, including Michael Caine as a financial backer and Morgan Freeman as a magic-act debunker. Caine and Freeman are their usual wonderful selves, each playing a superficially archetypal role which is then revealed to be not all that it seems as the plot unfolds. The FBI and Interpol are necessary characters for the plot, and Mark Ruffalo and Ms. Laurent do well considering their characters exist in part to be duped by the illusionists. The actors who portray the illusionists--Isla Fisher, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco-- infuse their roles with great energy, charm, and wit, albeit a theatrically glib wit. I and others in the theater remarked that we would have liked to see more of them on screen.The plot is too complex for me to do it justice before seeing the film again; suffice it to say, it involves four illusionists who build a complex act that seems to involve crimes which the FBI then investigates with comical frustration. The movie is worth seeing for the actors, the visuals, the locations, and the misdirection and plot twists. I am sure that a careful scrutiny will imply some plot holes that will bother some viewers, but I also believe that an even more careful scrutiny would reveal that some 'holes' are not as deep as they seem at first. "Now You See Me" is a wonderful summer movie with great performances, surprising plot twists, and a "feel-good" energy.

It is very important to realize that this movie must not be spoiled. I will not be discussing anything not shown in the trailers, and I ask you not to go looking for such secrets online, but only by watching it yourself. This movie is designed to entertain, and to a degree it does just that.I haven't seen many of Leterrier's films, but I enjoyed this about as much as The Incredible Hulk, but more than Clash of the Titans. There were still disappointments. Magic movies have been a great interest of mine, and from the trailer I had to wonder, does Michael Caine + woman in a tank = The Prestige? Truthfully, the similarities stopped there, including magic's screen time.Despite magic taking up most of the trailers, it was too scarce in the film itself. I wanted more magic. I know that doing so would take screen time from Ruffalo, but he wasn't the best of the bunch. In fact, they were Freeman, Caine, and Laurent, respectively.The screen writing didn't allow for many to develop character well. The Four Horsemen were usually smooth-talking brick walls. And was that Dave Franco I saw? He had no screen time! (except for brief fancy dodging falling fighting)These character holes would be acceptable if the movie were a large show. But as mentioned before, magic only came in smaller pieces, when at all. Some were amazing, some were old already, and some were hilarious.It seems like I didn't appreciate the movie much, but I could only talk about what I didn't like. The rest, the secrets, I loved but can't talk about. Suffice it to say that many surprises are in store, and they're worth watching the movie for. That said, it's best to go in without guessing and predicting, because seeing the many reveals is where most of the entertainment lies. Don't spoil it for yourself.This is a film some would be happier seeing in theatres, but if you don't think you'd spend ticket money for this, you'd probably regret it, so wait for DVD.As a warning, there is a suggestive/inappropriate scene near the beginning that ends up going nowhere, but children's eyes should be turned aside. Also, there's a moment in a Mardi Gras parade that needs to be avoided, and minor language throughout. I'd recommend this movie for 17+, not only for these, but for the understanding of the secret material I can't bring up.

I was given free advanced screening tickets to see this film, and being the film buff that I am, I took them and went and saw it. I had seen a trailer before hand and knew what to expect from the film, but I gotta be honest, my expectations were low and the only reason I watched it is cause they were free tickets.Now, after seeing it, I can tell you the film was an awesome surprise. The cast was great, the action fun, and the plot unique. I didn't see any of the twists coming and I found the film to be very entertaining. It doesn't get too convoluted at any point and is a great chase/illusion film. It's like a funner version of The Prestige, not that the two belong in the same class, just an easy way to quickly summarize what the movie is trying to accomplish (although Michael Caine is in both films!)Go see it, as will I, again. A fun summer movie that is likely to surprise more than a few people with its plot and twists!

In a rare lucky event, I won tickets to an advanced Screening of this movie yesterday. I was intrigued by the preview during another movie, but I certainly wasn't expecting such an awesome display.The Plot of the movie is this: 4 street artists (Dave Franco as Jack, Jesse Eisenberg as Michael, Isla Fisher as Henley and Woody Harrelson as Merritt) with individual talents receive an invitation from a source with out much explanation, just a time and address. A year later, they are a successful group called The Four Horsemen, working together putting on the best magic shows on stage. Their biggest illusion is to rob a bank while never once leaving the stage and live audience. You can guess what happens next, as without being successful, there would be no movie to watch. Enter the FBI and a round of interrogations that have never been funnier. And, before you know it, you're on a wild chase and loving it.The visuals and magic 'tricks' in this film were beautifully crafted without being over the top. The plot was fun and wild taking the audience on a crazy chase where it was hard to predict what was going to happen next. Just when you think you've got it figured out, they twist it.The performances by the stellar cast were amazing. Even though the audience doesn't really get to know the characters well, the pace of the game moved so quickly it really doesn't matter. I was only mildly disappointed that we didn't get to see more of the characters in their starting points - how did they get to where they were before their source? There was some obvious history between Michael and Henley which was never explored. And, where did Merritt learn his techniques? Lots of questions which were left open - hopefully with a sequel or prequel in mind. It sure felt like there was more story to tell but as Micheal Atlas says in the beginning of the movie ' You're looking too close'. The bigger picture of the movie is what makes it so spectacular. I'll be back in line to see it again when it is officially released on May 31st. I don't think you'll be disappointed either.

This is an interesting concept, surely not a genre played out much in Hollywood. The cast is jam packed with all stars giving great (but not their best) performances. The missing piece of the puzzle? Character development. That's not to say that there is any lack of interesting characters, each of the four horsemen bring a very unique style to the movie (besides Henley, she's rather weak as a character), and the sheer amount of Talent present in each scene guarantees that you'll be entertained. 10/10? Hardly. But definitely a solid 8 for me. Entertaining, fun, and definitely a concept worth exploring on the big screen. Just remember, the closer you look, the less you'll actually see.

Now You See Me is a film that is all about obfuscation. Focusing on four magicians that perform feats of wonder first separately and later together, from the first frame on, the film engages in cinematic sleight of hand. However, that formula backfires on the film: by constantly trying to engage in trickery, the audience finds itself always on the lookout for it, and by the time it starts winding down, most of the potential surprises are rendered moot by the fact that we were looking for and expecting said surprises. Thus, while Now You See Me is fun and engaging at times, as a twist-filled surprise machine, it falls flat on it's face.As the film opens, we are introduced to four illusionists: fast talking street-level card sharp Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), "mentalist" and small-time con man Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), spoon-bending junior magician Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and show-stopping high-thrills Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). All of them are given a special card with an address and time on it, and when they all show up at the prescribed time and place, a small apartment in New York, they discover what appears to be a quite elaborate set of plans. Flash forward one year later, and the four magicians are performing as a single act under the moniker The Four Horsemen and are being bankrolled by millionaire Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) During their debut performance in Las Vegas, they close their act with a rather spectacular accomplishment: they transport a French audience member to his bank in France and proceed to steal several billion dollars from it and magically transport it back to the Las Vegas auditorium where they pour it onto the audience.Unsurprisingly, this gets the attention of the FBI, and agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is assigned to the case. He teams up with Interpol agent Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent) and interrogates the Four Horsemen, but with nothing to pin on them, is forced to let them walk. Rhodes seeks the counsel of former magician Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who now spends his time debunking magicians, revealing what is "behind the curtain". With Bradley's help, Rhodes is able to unravel what happened at the first performance, but the Four Horsemen are already moving on to New Orleans for their next show and Rhodes and Dray are trying to stay one step ahead of them.Now You See Me is a film that is intended to keep us on our toes, to leave the audience guessing and wondering what the next revelation is going to be. Sometimes these kind of films can work well, engaging in misdirection and providing red herrings and dead ends for us to believe in before showing us what is really going on. Where Now You See Me missteps is that, from very early in the proceedings, the film telegraphs its intentions so loudly that most of the enjoyment of being caught up in twists is lost. That the twists are such a central part of the film is obvious from the start and makes them less engaging than if they evolved more naturally out of the narrative. Now You See Me is designed and built almost exclusively to keep us guessing but by focusing almost exclusively on that, it overreaches.Now You See Me isn't helped by the fact that the main characters are, save for some quickly introduced character moments and a few exchanges of witty dialogue, almost completely ciphers. Atlas, McKinnney, Wilder and Reeves are barely developed at all, and frankly, excepting for the moments they are performing their stage acts, are not even afforded that much screen time. The screenplay does play a bit with the intentions of the characters, but it is obvious that we are supposed to be rooting for them at times, and it makes it difficult to work up much enthusiasm for them when we barely know them. More screen time is afforded to Rhodes and Dray, and the two develop a romantic chemistry that is palpable at times, but, much like the other characters, they are largely pawns of the screenplay, but they are at least given more to work with than the magicians.Director Louis Leterrier films Now You See Me in Michael Bay mode: the camera rarely stops moving for more than a few seconds. During the magic acts, especially the first one in Vegas, this does bring a degree of style to the proceedings but at times the over reliance on an endlessly moving camera can prove distracting. However, Leterrier does keep the pace brisk and the energy level high. Now You See Me certainly can't be called boring.If Now You See Me succeeds anywhere, it is in the casting. Leterrier has pulled together a strong set of performers and, especially regarding the Four Horsemen, what is sometimes lacking in the screenplay is made up for by likable actors. Eisenberg makes Atlas a fast talking smart alec with a nice streak of charisma, Harrelson gives some fun wisecracks and Fisher is, once again, a strong sensual presence with a degree of toughness. Morgan Freeman can't help but class up anything he appears in and his turn here is no different, his Bradley is nice mix of arrogance and charm. Ruffalo is also at his dependable best, a man fighting to stay with his fugitives while barely managing to stay on top of their capers. It may sound like I am down on Now You See Me, but that isn't completely true. By the time the film was over, I found myself pleasantly engaged and entertained at times, but so much is wrapped up in the film's obvious Rube Goldberg plotting that you can't but help feel disappointed when the film doesn't really deviate from where you expect. Now You See Me is like sneaking a peek at your Christmas gifts: knowing what is coming isn't as much fun as not knowing.

Imagine Now You See Me as Ocean's Eleven meets The Prestige and you sort of get what director Louis Leterrier was going for with this film. Is Now You See Me as successful as the aforementioned films? Not necessarily, but it's a fun movie that deconstructs the acts of modern magicians.The story follows four Vegas magicians, known as the Four Horsemen, who rob a bank in the middle of one of their shows. What follows is a cat-and-mouse thriller where the FBI chases after these magicians, always one step behind, trying to figure out how they did it.Where Now You See Me works best is when Leterrier creates cinematic sequences showing us how these magicians used real-life magic tricks to befuddle and dupe both their victims and the FBI. As well, if you want a film with twists and turns, this one will not disappoint. While most of the major twists can be found out before revealed, there is still a joy in watching those twists unfold, thanks to Leterrier's Sherlock Holmes' style of visual deduction. However, the script often falters in one of the most crucial areas, that of character.Leterrier and company are constantly trying to balance the breakneck pace with the large cast of characters, and it just leaves the characters hanging out to dry. Character development is sorely lacking in Now You See Me, to where I never really cared about any of the characters. Part of this is because the film is constantly shifting points of view. The first thirty minutes follow our Robin Hood-like magicians, and then it switches to the FBI agents tracking them down, but then the film has the magicians constantly one step in front of the FBI to the point that it makes the FBI often come across as buffoons, and I find it hard to care for characters who are so easily fooled. Ultimately, I feel that had the film focused entirely on one set of characters, like the magicians or the FBI, the film would have been stronger and been easier to find a focal point, but as it is the film's core is often muddled.While Now You See Me may not be a grand slam, it's still entertaining, thanks to the thrills and visual style of the film. Bottom line, if you're a fan of the heist genre, you'll like this movie. For me though, it just lacks a further script rewrite to have become one of the best examples of the genre.I give Now You See Me an 8 out of 10!

I saw "Now You See Me", starring Jesse Eisenberg-The Social Network, Zombieland, Woody Harrelson-The Hunger Games, Zombieland, Mark Ruffalo-The Avengers, 13 Going on 30 and Morgan Freeman-Olympus Has Fallen, Red.This is a movie about illusionists that pull bank heists but don't keep their ill-gotten gains; they reward their audiences with the money. Jesse and Woody are 2 of the 4 prestidigitators that are gathered together by an unknown benefactor for unknown reasons-at least they are unknown until the end of the film. Each one of the 4-they call themselves 'The 4 Horsemen'-have different specialties-one is a mentalist , one is an escape artist , etc.. After their first heist, Mark-an F.B.I. agent-starts trying to apprehend the group but has no luck. Morgan plays a famous former magician that is now a famous debunker of magicians-he reveals how they do their tricks and is enlisted by Mark to help him catch the thieves. I have always been interested in magic tricks and the way they work so this movie was right up my alley-most of the tricks are explained later in the movie. It's rated "PG-13" for language and sexual content and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes. I enjoyed this one and I would buy this on Blu-Ray.

First of all, let me say that this film does not break your trust by tossing out some deus ex machina explanation at the end or plot-twist you so hard your head falls off. The threads of story, while somewhat outlandish, are well-woven and resolved almost totally satisfactorily. That's basically my fancy way of saying I didn't guess the ending, it did make sense, and the journey there was fun.I wouldn't say that this is a highly intellectual movie with layers and layers of philosophical questions to ponder over after it's over, but it isn't stupid either. You're not bored by over-complexity or insulted by the inanely simple. I appreciate that balance.The cast is solid but the characters could (and should have) been explored more without any worry over the plot getting spoiled. Because of this missed opportunity you may question the overall motivation of the antiheroes, especially since your first impression of the four magicians is that they are selfish and have no grandiose plans for their lives. This doesn't mean they aren't easy to like, but I feel it does clash with the story later on.The visuals/camarawork are nice (although occasionally too spinney and maybe just a little too glossy), the humor and the romance are felt and enjoyed- no baggage, no complication, no melodrama, and the magic is explained. In real life, we know that commercial slight of hand needs to be left unexplained otherwise it loses its worth, but the makers of this movie know that film must tie the loose ends because the satisfaction is the conclusion, NOT the mystery in and of itself.That being said, I will admit the overall conclusion was left just a tiny bit blurry, which may be due to the hope for a sequel. I'd honestly be okay with that as I feel this film earned it. Moviegoers may begrudge it that open-ended feeling though, if they felt that the explanation was not a justifiable payoff. My advice is to go see it, have fun, and let your belief be suspended. At worst the hypnotism will leave you disoriented and grumpy, at best you'll have a blast and come back down as soft as a feather.

The title makes so much sense...now you see me as a great movie...now you don't!The movie was wonderful from start to ALMOST end, it will get you laughing and clapping and so sucked in a thrill ride and each character in the movie is very unique and very interesting, the pace is very fast which is good except for the interpol officer, corny, predictable role that is very slow and again predictable.There are numerous scenes that will make you feel really excited especially a fight/ escape scene that had Mark Ruffalo and Dave Franco. It was one of the many great exciting scenes.Unfortunately towards the end after an "OMG" reveal, things start to plummet in light speed and things start to make little sense and the plot loses it's value and you feel that the magic trick finale is on you...and not in the good twist sense.*sigh*

"First rule of magic: always be the smartest person in the room." J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) In the case of the magical little entertainment called Now You See Me, you don't have to be the smartest person in the audience to be charmed by the illogical "magic" of the tricks or the script. In a takeoff of traditional heist films and homage to recent films like The Incredible Burt Wonderstone and The Prestige, with a smattering of smart, sometimes humorous chatter, this film moves at rapid pace (French director Louis Leterrier knows how from his Transporter films) with a lack of seriousness about the tricks, which are mostly explained as the film moves on.Those revelations will bother purists who don't want to know the secrets or critics who demand a reasonable arc for the story. Like the magic itself, the film eventually captures the imagination enough to suspend disbelief and just go with the fun.The "four horsemen" (Atlas, played by Eisenberg; Merritt by Woody Harrelson; Henley by Isla Fisher; and Jack by Dave Franco) create three successive magic shows, one in Las Vegas, a second in New Orleans, and the third in New York. The stakes rise incrementally as they appear to be playing Robin Hood to their large, American-Idol type audiences by showering them with money from their magical heists. The FBI with Agent Dylan (Mark Ruffalo) is in hot but bungling pursuit.As in most thrillers, there are minor twists, and the final one that stretches credulity, or that some will see coming, along with a hopper full of smaller ones even naïve I could see from far off. Besides, like the Oceans films' heists, it's not about the heist or the magic. It's about the slick magicians, their easy banter, and comeuppance for the real baddies.Outrageous set pieces like the car race will disconcert those looking for a tightly-told narrative. The magic is as always questionable because film deals in magic with practically every frame. However, the cast is delightfully comic, the direction speedy and tricky, and the entire film wants you in on the magic. For a summer film, that's a magic formula.

Just caught the film on Friday opening weekend. To sum it up in one word is "entertaining". It has the special affects you would expect from ILM behind the scenes. While a few plot mechanism may seem familiar, there is enough original content and spin that it will keep your attention throughout. It has light humor throughout which keeps the experience light hearted. The strong points are the script, acting, directing, cinematography, and visual affects. Yes, it is about stage magicians, but movie magic is used to keep the illusion alive and not actual stage theatrics. The only noticeable weak point is it has potential to be a little bit better in execution of some of the plot twist and it keeps a few important details a little too subtle for one viewing for some viewers.It is a story driven film and not so much a character driven story. There is enough character development to make sense but not balanced enough to feel as engaged to every character. You will understand the characters but may not root for them as much as I'd like. Morgan Freeman certainly holds the screen well and his lines keep people up to speed if they miss something. His character is something of an in movie narrator, but done well from a writing and acting perspective. Jessie Eisenburg's character is also entertaining and engaging as one of the Four Horsemen (the name of the magical stage performers).It has multiple plot twist, some big and some small. These keep you engaged and trying to guess the next move or explain what just happened. A good film to watch with friends and talk about afterwards.It has a good mass appeal and has only a little cussing (3 words I can remember), violence (from car chases), or intense scenes (magic tricks gone wrong where possible bodily harm is implied but not seen) to not keep the younger viewers away. The plot twist may be too complicated for non-teenager youth. Overall it is very entertaining.

This is a bit of Ocean's 11 meets The Prestige and I'm sure some people will find it derivative, but the mash up of magic and heist movie worked for me. This was tremendous fun from the beginning more or less until the end (more on that later). We meet our four magical heroes in montage fashion that recalls Ocean's 11: each is shown working their own routines and then receiving a tarot card telling them to meet at a specific place and time. A year or so later, they have a magical act together in Las Vegas under the name The Four Horsemen, where they tell the crowd that they will rob a bank live on stage. They then – supposedly – teleport a French banker to his Parisian bank to steal thousands in Euros and leave a calling card, the money is then rained down upon the crowd. Later shows in New Orleans and New York follow the same format. In New Orleans, we see that their act is a kind of Robin Hood gesture, as money is stolen from an insurance magnate and redistributed to foreclosure victims.Morgan Freeman stars as a former magician who now makes a living debunking magic acts and trying to figure out the gang's method; and Mark Ruffalo is the federal agent attempting the catch the Four Horseman committing a robbery. The main cast – Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco – are wonderfully charming. There are a few one liners that fall with a thud, and a couple plot points that might have been better developed, but the movie is a breezy ride most of the way through. Dave Franco, as always, should get more screen time.The central mystery to this plot is who is pulling the strings; who summoned the Four Horsemen to their meeting and organized each of the heists? The answer, when we receive it, is a bit unfair and leaves many open questions. The more you examine the questions, the less they make sense; though repeat viewings may disprove me. This isn't a Sixth Sense kind of ending where you should have seen it coming all along; it's more of a Murder of Roger Ackroyd solution where the perp wasn't even really a suspect.I think that many people will feel cheated by the ending. Still, this movie was an hour and 50 minutes and I thought some more development and additional scenes could have been included. When I want a movie to stretch longer, it's definitely working for me.

This movie started off good and stayed that way. Right from the jump you're thrown into a instant mesmerizing view of excitement. After that I felt like I was flipped straight into a coliseum of amazing special effects ( or at this point I can't say it wasn't * pause for dramatic affect * MAGIC - picture me doing wavy magic fingers, OK stop picturing me doing that I'm done now ) Mind blowing action that I did not expect from this genre of movie mixed with a storyline and plot that kept me wide eyed and interested every step of the way. All the actors did an incredible job. No one was out shined. Every line was delivered excellent and was Believable. This is easily a movie I can watch multiple times with the same excitement as the first. I won't spoil anything for you except the fact that this movie was money well spent. I left happy and I'm still excited to talk about it

Abra Kadabra my friends, and like magic another weekend is upon us and another round of movies. This week I start my reviews off with a Crime/Thriller that chooses to use stage performance, illusion, and trickery to pull off the heist. That's right I'm reviewing Now You See Me, a movie that promises to be magical, just not Lord of the Rings magical. So put away your wands and spell books, and get out your deck of cards as I give my two cents on this movie.Let's get right into some of my likes for. First thing has to be the clever plot/execution of this movie. Now we have seen plenty of crime movies over the last decade that use the same stale plot of a highly skilled team pulling of an impossible task of bringing a corrupt man to justice. Now you see me takes that stale plot and reconstructs into something that seems fresh and new. Instead of an elite band of mercenaries, we have four misfits who practice different tricks of the magic trade. They are pulled together by some mastermind who opens the door with a rather shady invite and a year later the adventure starts as the Four Horsemen are forged. Cue the Vegas scene, made famous in the trailer, where the audience, both fiction and real, are dazzled by an elaborate show where the eyes are fooled by the sleight of hand. Only rather than making a simple toy appear, the result is money robbed from a city bank miles away. This allows me to transition into another aspect of the movie, the design of the tricks. In this film, many things were planned out, every detail intricately laced into an adventure that is both intense and impressive. While there are some classic magic tricks done, pick a card and making rabbits disappear, there are some other acts that have more complexity to it. Although these CGI heavy stunts are a bit fake and far-fetched they still were creative enough to wow me. Even more impressive to this reviewer, was the fact that the tricks were linked to the master plan, many specifically chosen for a purpose other than entertainment, cleverness at its finest.Another trend you might notice in other crime movies, is that nine times out of ten the police force are either ignorant or idiots. Well good news, they still are, but this time there is a little more ingenuity to some of their force. Led by Mark Ruffalo, the police actually learn a little from their mistakes and with a little guidance from an outside source, attempted to change their strategy. Ruffalo and company not only bring on the opposing force to the Horsemen, but also provide an opening for other characters to enter into the movie, often to explain how the tricks work. You heard me right, the magicians' secrets are revealed in this movie, but done so to help tie together the loose ends left behind after the excitement has passed. How could this explanation get any better? Simple bring on Morgan Freeman, an actor whose voice and talent bring the retired magician bent on deciphering secrets to life. Like many of his roles, this character has humor, wits, and a little input into helping with some of the shallow character development. With this in mind, if you don't want to find out how the connections fit you need to either leave the theater at points in the movie, or avoid seeing it altogether. Bottom line the movie is connected and all the characters are involved in some form or manner. So with a bunch of characters you may wonder how the acting is in this movie. In a nutshell most of the actors are playing the same roles we've seen in other films. Jesse Eisenberg still plays the arrogant jerk, who is incredibly clever and gifted, and insults everyone else. For some reason though, I do like his character in this movie, as the attitude goes with the theme of the movie. Isla Fisher is still bubbly, but this time she isn't some shallow air head who only cares about sex and shopping. Ruffalo does a good job as well, acting as an integral cog for most of the movie. Similar to what we saw in Avengers, Ruffalo has quirky one liners, a smart ass attitude, but still retains a serious demeanor that rounds the character out. My favorite actor of the night though is Woody Harrelson, who has all the qualities from the Hunger games, minus the drinking and add some running. Overall there are really no surprises when it comes to acting, I enjoyed all of them and I am sure you will find someone to latch onto in this movie. This movie is definitely a fun summer movie with creativity bursting at every seam. Yes the plot is fairly predictable, and I do agree the plot is a bit old. Yet this movie has many good things about it that makes it worthy of taking a trip to the theater. It is exciting, with a plethora of chase scenes and fight scenes to keep the pace going. Although some of the mystery is ruined by Freeman's deductive reasoning, there are still some underlying secrets that keep you intrigued into the movie, like who the mastermind is and what are the motives for pulling off the pranks. Yes there is a bit of cheesiness in the plot, and some of the stunts they pull are again a bit far-fetched that some people may roll their eyes, but for those who like a lot of imagination and clever execution, this movie is for you. So what do I give this movie? My scores are Crime/Thriller 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5

As someone who enjoys trying to figure out what's coming next 'Now You See Me' was incredibly entertaining. Perhaps you'll fare better in terms of whether or not you can guess what's happening but regardless it should be a fun exercise.Aside from that the performances were all really good. The director had a nice pace in terms of have things progressed and there didn't appear to be any parts of the movie where certain scenes were clearly sped up (a personal pet peeve of mine).I was able to see a pre-screening for the movie so there could be some bias in my review (free movie helps, right?) but I am planning on going to see it later today so I obviously don't mind paying full price to watch it again. That and I've pretty much told everyone I know that they should see it in the nicest way possible in order to keep expectations reasonable.Definitely recommend you to go see it because it's a fun movie/experience :-)

The movie opened strong with a lot of magic tricks, but the rest of the film also was not lacking in magic either. The whodunnit's appeal came from the use of "magic" tricks and it also was generous with action, making for a truly exciting movie. I was thrilled through the entire film.The characters were each sharp and specialized in their own tricks. Eisenberg was, of course, given a snarky, arrogant personality with witty lines and the magic tricks to back it up. I felt that Ruffalo was taking to much time away from the amazing magicians, but he also did a good job. The only downside is that Dave Franco had almost no speaking lines and little screen time. All in all, the film was excellent and full of FUN.

I went into this movie not to sure of what to expect. I knew the basics of the plot and I knew I really liked the cast. Going in I really wanted to like this movie and I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed it.I love Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg in everything I've seen them in and this movie was no exception Between them the other 2 leads a great supporting cast and a surprisingly smart and funny story this movie was a really fun ride. I really loved Mark Ruffalo in this movie especially his twist at the end. Having loved him in The Avengers I was really happy to see that he was not just the cop who could not keep up and do his job as you are made to think throughout the movie.There is plenty more detail I could go into but I'm gonna keep this review short. So in short go see this movie if you think it looks cool it won't disappoint. I personally would really like to see a sequel seeing as how the ending was left open for one but given the box office numbers so far i'm not sure i see that happening but oh well I give Now You See Me an 8/10

Now You See Me is basically a heist film which involves magicians, and it seems like it's going to be one of those illusion themed films that adds mind tricking elements throughout the plot. It begins featuring impressive magic tricks before it proceeds to its intriguing premise. It works best as a fast paced thriller with all the crazy action and ideas it brought, but as a clever mindbender, it effects rather differently than what it wants. The good thing is it's just simple and fun for embracing its own magic. Some tricks may get out of hand, but Now You See Me is a film that is easy enough to be charmed.The plot sounds silly, but it's hard to not feel the excitement behind these illusions. No matter how dangerous it turns, it's still all about the magic. The most fun parts are when they're performing their thing. The whole merit of the film is its heart to show that these tricks are actually entertaining. Even the simplest ones like the deck of cards and hypnotism are still fascinating to watch. The cast keep these acts alive. Jesse Eisenberg and Isla Fisher seem to have the enthusiasm of performing these tricks. Woody Harrelson is always a joy to watch. Mark Ruffalo, Dave Franco, and Melanie Laurent also made their roles a bit memorable, while Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are just sitting around doing their fine usual thing.When it goes to the second act, they should be cracking the code of the illusions. It's ought to be a thought-provoking mystery, but it disappointingly over explains every detail. Even at every twist it reveals, they have to talk it out how the entire set up was built plus flashbacks to be clearer. The concept of being mind boggling is compromised and now stays to the comfort zone of bringing typical action set pieces. Some of the action can be whimsically inspired which fits to this environment.The result of Now You See Me is not "Pure Magic" like what the tagline says nor genius, but it's an honest piece of cinema that offers real thrills even without the over-serious tone that moviegoers today suggests. The film still needs to be trickier. It started out overwhelming then slowly becomes the opposite later on. Despite the missteps it makes, the experience is undeniably endlessly entertaining, thanks to the enthusiasm for magic and delightful performances. Now You See Me didn't apply as being cleverer, but it's still a good blockbuster anyway.

This film surprised me not only with it's intense action scenes or the originality of the plot but by the comedy being able to co-exist with all other elements. My attention was immediately captured by the film's energetic intro which will not lose you through the entire movie. This isn't a type of flick where you really need to turn off your brain, at times it has mildly ingenious tricks which will easily please you. The main thing this film exceeds at is the way it keeps the audience guessing the conclusion/twists, it will work your brain actually tricking you in the process. The movie takes advantage of Eisenberg's usual "smart-ass" character, Woody Harrelson also shines, raking in most of the laughs. It truly is magical, in it's twists and action sequences. This is really like a 2 hour Las Vegas show without the Las Vegas cost. As a comedy it meets expectations as well as a thriller, it keeps you at the edge of your seat ultimately deceiving you with it's unique yet realistic twist. Overall, this is a fun summer flick that doesn't go for any cheap laughs.

(May contain SPOILERS) One of the most annoying things about "Now You See Me" is lens flare. Lens flare is the current cinematic trick du jour, if not obsession of many directors looking to slick up their movies with a high gloss. Lens flare, you may recall, is when light enters the lens, refracts and creates a brief mini super-nova across the film frame. The cinematic equivalent of having a flashlight shone in your eyes, which this film does, on numerous occasions. It's an apt visual metaphor for a movie that proclaims itself to be about diverting the gaze in order to trick the viewer. But here, temporary blindness (like fake lens flare), is a cheap gimmick that is much easier to employ than true slight of hand. There's no real sense of magic in this movie that is about magic. The tricks along with the nature of magic itself are constantly being explained along the way draining the film of magic of any kind. The would be "brainy" complications of the plot are not brainy enough...the complicated bank account trick slogs on for what seems an eternity. Capers need to be plotted with air-tight precision that stand up to repeated viewings. The caper needs to be carried out by characters about whom you care enough to be invested in whether or not they get caught. The filmmakers here make the deadly mistake of thinking the tricks are more interesting than the tricksters. And present a series of tricks that are not really all that compelling. Shallow characters carrying out rather pedestrian tricks adds up to a movie that's rather shallow and pedestrian, no matter how much lens flare you throw at the camera. Which is a shame, because it's a fantastic premise which should have been developed for someone up to the task...a cinematic magician if you will. As for the plot, it gets loopier as it goes along, trying to explain itself because it really has no point. You never really know what anyone's motivation is...who is Morgan Freeman again? Why is Michael Caine in this and why is it okay to rob him? Which would be fine, except the movie is at such pains to keep explaining itself (literally) it starts to feel that the movie is explaining itself to itself. The actors were all wasted, trying desperately to impart some kind of character to their character (Harrelson is most successful, but his efforts are for naught. Eisenberg is completely wasted). There is one thrilling scene when the movie comes to life. A fight in a small apartment between one of the magicians and two FBI agents. The magician uses the magic from up his sleeves to fend off the two men. This scene, which approached a kind of magic, was what "Now You See Me" needed more of. But you'll have to settle for lens flare.

I found this movie's lowish ranking incredibly misleading, and I'm glad I decided to go see this one. It's a fast paced ride that will keep you guessing. My movie-buff sister who ALWAYS predicts movies failed to predict this one.Unlike Prestige and Illusionist, all of the "tricks" in this flick are actually feasible, and several are explained. This only adds to the thrill as your mind tries to work out, "how?", let alone who & why.There is some good action thrown in plus there's a fun mix of fantastic personalities, so it feels like The Avengers at some points.Worth a trip to the theater.

OK, I saw it for the second time on 6/4/13...and I want to change my entire review about it. I now enjoyed it SO much better! I did not leave the theater at all confused. I loved hearing audience reaction and being one of the very few in the know. I went with my family and from time to time my Mom would lean into me and ask questions. I had to keep telling her 'just watch!' LOL. When I watched it the first time I missed two minutes of it (elevator scene) so I was glad to finally see that! Awww! :)This movie is just brilliant because you DO have to see it twice to catch on to everything. I NOW give it a 9/10----------------------This is what I said the first time on 6/1/13 ...I really don't know how I feel about this film after finally watching it because I was too amped up in watching it that I researched it, read updates from those who saw it and got excited, too excited as my expectations were a bit cheated. (Word of advice, don't read critiques or opinions prior to viewing it) I didn't really read about the film and or have it spoiled for me except seeing previews, videos and hearing so much praise for it that I was expecting mind blowing results but I'm reminded of this saying from Sheldon Cooper (Big Bang Theory) 'You told me it's mind-blowing, so my mind is going into it pre- blown, and once a mind is *pre*-blown, it cannot be *re*-blown.' that is EXACTLY how I felt leaving the theater. It was a great fun movie no doubt. I do not diminish anything about the film but I will say this you have to have the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it. My only complaint is that there needed to be more development for the four horseman. (It could've used at least another 30 minutes if you ask me) because they needed more screen- time. Im not gonna give anything away but I was not all that blown away in the end. I kinda figured it out. However, great cast, great acting and I WILL see it again. See that is what was brilliant about it. TPTB made it in a way that YOU have to see it again. Whether its for pure enjoyment, catching up or you missed something the first time.8/10

Now You See Me (2013) *** (out of 4)Entertaining but far-fetched action picture about four magicians (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco) who use their talents to pull off some bank robberies. An FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) and a former magician (Morgan Freeman) try to figure out exactly how the tricks are being done and especially since there's no logical explanation. If the trailer for NOW YOU SEE ME left you feeling somewhat cold like me, then the movie itself is actually much better. The trailer would make you believe that this is just going to be a silly little movie and it is to a point but there's also a few nice tricks being done in the screenplay and director Louis Leterrier also manages to do quick a magic trick himself. Throughout the film we're told to believe in magic you can't look too closely to the trick. I think if we look too closely at this story we're going to have many logical problems but the director does a good job at making you forget these and just takes you along for the ride. There's no question that I was entertained from start to finish because the screenplay is good enough to keep you on your toes and you're never quite sure where the story is going to take you. Another plus is that we're given a pretty good cast and each one does a very good job in their parts. Eisenberg plays the brain like no other can. Harrelson has that sly charm working well. Ruffalo is good as the cop and pros like Freeman and Michael Caine never fail. Melanie Lauren is also extremely good in her supporting part. The film offers up some dazzling cinematography and there's no question that the look of the film is very impressive. NOW YOU SEE ME isn't a masterpiece but I think it's a very well-made film that at least does what a cheap magic trick does and that's entertain you.

The movie is a nice layaway for your Sunday evening mind when you need a nice entertainer to finish off your good weekend so that you get ready for a productive weekend."Now you see me" is an uncovering of the tricks and magics that goes into the wildest dreams you've ever had for a good magic act. There are enough movie actions in it to treat you to your ordinary movie magic and visual scope of the whole movie is a fine treat to your sore eyes.For the harsh movie critics, the movie lacks inner plot dynamics of a character-driven epic of well-created drama, but there are enough twist and turn to keep you interested for the whole movie and the whole dimension of the movie takes you in to a very creative part of your mind. The movie tickles the imagination of the very best magic tricks there exists in our world today and challenges you to comprehend the complexity of a good trick."Now you see me" is definitely an easy-going magic-themed movie with an easy-to-intermediate plot structure that would cater to all family ready to understand and take in the great essence of what a magic is.

This movie really leads you to believe that its going to be exciting, intriguing and thrilling. Instead, you may come out of it feeling like you yourself have had a magic trick played on you. The characters are cocky and annoying. Its hard to develop any sort of connection with them. All the magic tricks and illusions are very unrealistic. The "romantic" element of the story is incredibly forced; almost thrown in at the last moment because the producers were like "oh ya! we forgot to add the romance". There's nothing subtle about the tone of the movie. You're constantly reminded that there is a mysterious element that you are not seeing. And when it is finally revealed at the end, there is hardly any surprise at all. Worst of all, there are too many things that happen in the movie inexplicably. You find yourself waiting for information that never comes. Questions are posed that leave you wondering why something happened, but then they're just abandoned and never reexamined. This movie made me angry. I felt like it was condescending to me the entire time. Fast talking "quick witted" characters using dialogue spoken so fast with convoluted vocabulary, camera shots that were shaky and always moving. It was trying to confuse me with smoke and mirrors to make me think that it was exciting, intriguing and thrilling, but realistically it was not.

Any show you go to see, whether it be magic shows or the movies, rely on dazzling and guiding the audience to a surprising and enjoyable outcome, ultimately making the audience believe that what they see is real. In Now You See Me, the principles of magic are used in this interesting premise: magicians who use their skills in deception and illusion to stage daring bank heists in front of the eyes of their audiences and the police.This film is not as deep or thoughtful as other magician-themed films, like The Prestige or The Illusionist. As a heist film, however, it's phenomenally entertaining. The film sets up the cop and robbers characters with playful energy and chemistry, before breaking out the visually-impressive theatrics and action scenes. It's not big on action, but the film does move fluidly, and above all, the characters are fun to watch. I'd say it's every bit as enjoyable as a film like Ocean's 11, The Italian Job, or The Thieves.Critics will likely find fault in the plot, which requires some huge suspension of disbelief to accept. Given the twists and the liberal use of magic tricks, plot holes are bound to be present. It might be especially frustrating to watch the more fantastic moments and wonder how these characters could pull off such trickery; the film does reveal the particulars of what's going on with the overall heists, but there are other moments where the film seems to assert that magic is actually happening.However, there is a certain theme to the picture, stipulating that "the closer you look, the less you see." Indeed, if you scrutinize this plot too closely, you'll miss out on the larger experience. The film practically implores you to just sit back, take it as it is, and enjoy things as they are. If you can suspend disbelief and go with the flow, you'll find that the plot is structured in wild and unpredictable ways. There are certain things to the story that could have been explored more, but perhaps a sequel is in order. Critics would say that the characters are all unlikable, and it's hard to know who to root for: I was personally enthralled by the whole cast, and was actually rooting for the magicians, for I found them all to be lively, rounded, and surprising at times. They aren't terribly deep, but they have surprises of their own.Some of the film's action scenes get a little jittery, but most of it has solid photography and editing. Acting is superb all around: everybody puts on a playful and energetic performance. Writing is not bad. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and okay special effects. Music is really hip.The film asserts that magic is not about understanding how tricks work, but in making audiences believe in it, and making them smile. If you're the type who wants to look closely and find something deep, artistic, or even logical about Now You See Me, then the less you'll see. I was able to accept the film's illusion, and it made me smile at times, for it is an enjoyable show. If you can accept the film's illusion, then you might find it enjoyable as well.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

When I first saw the trailer for the movie, I was immediately captivated and wanted to go see it on the opening weekend. It didn't disappoint, but there were still some missing pieces.First off, the characters. While watching the movie, you don't quite think much of them but once the movie's over, you realize that you don't know much about them. It's hard to find a character likable when you're not sure what their background check is and if they're not given enough screen time. I would've liked for the writers to embellish the Four Horsemen characters, especially Dave Franco's. He was barely given any screen time and I found it interesting that his character wants to be treated like an adult and not like a kid. I would've also liked to get to know Melanie Laurent's character better. The acting was good, but not Oscar-worthy.Also, the 'romance' part between Jesse Eisenberg and Isla Fisher's characters. That was never continued and it left me hanging with a question mark as to how that would turn out.The plot was interesting, the fight scenes and the car chase scene was gripping. There weren't many magic tricks but there were plenty of clever twists.The ending was surprising. It was a bit strange when you first find out because it felt to me, a bit awkward as to how the Detective could've kept his cover as the Fifth Horseman all that time. But, when you start going over the movie afterwards, it fits well in to the plot and it didn't come out of nowhere.Overall, it was a really fun and gripping movie. Even if the characters were not that memorable, I enjoyed the plot twists and the clever tricks. If you like movies that make your brain work just a little bit, you will like this one.

I was pleasantly surprised with this film because I thought it would be repetitive, but it was not. I enjoyed the plot twists and the acting in between them. All the characters were amazing and each of "The Four Horseman" had each of their own kind of magic trick in a cool way. And there was surprisingly humor in this film and the jokes were delivered incredibly. But in between the "Acts" I got bored because if you realize it, you are not really being amazed by humans, it is just the special effects. And I did not like the whole history lesson about the pharaohs and "The Eye". It was surprisingly amazing to see that Dylan Rhoades was actually the leader of "The Four Horseman. Overall I give this film a solid 9.

NOW YOU SEE ME (2013) ** Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Melanie Laurent, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Michael Kelly, Common, David Warshofsky. Too cute for its own good caper comedy about a group of magicians whose extravaganzas involve grand larceny prove to be a bothersome nuisance for a FBI agent (Ruffalo) and a sexy Interpol colleague (Laurent) attempting to solve the mysteries involved while being one-step behind the conspirators plottings. While the ensemble seem to be having a ball the film unfolds by its ridiculous conclusion which turns out to be too much of a good thing. (Dir. Louis Letterier)

Greetings again from the darkness. Come on ... who wouldn't get excited about a movie that mixes magic with the heist genre, and fills the cast with stars old and new? Director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter) is clearly engaged with the material, and maybe his vision of "just one more twist" is what keeps it from reaching the next level.Magic is inherently a very difficult subject for movies. Why? Because with magic, human nature is such that we are always trying to "catch" the sleight of hand. With movies, we have come to accept the fact that any special effect is possible. We rarely ask "how". That kind of takes away the mystery, eh? Maybe the best magic movie to date is The Prestige, but even that movie was made stronger by the story of its characters ... something this latest lacks.Heist movies, on the other hand, have historically produced some of the most fun and thrilling times on screen. Everyone loves a clever caper ... so long as we aren't on the wrong end. What doesn't work in either genre, and especially when they are blended, is a story that defies logic. We don't mind being tricked. In fact, it's kind of fun getting to the end and realizing you are part of the "gotcha". What we don't like is being cheated.The premise is terrific. An unknown benefactor secretly assembles The Four Horsemen - a hand-picked (by a hoodie dude) group consisting of Jessie Eisenberg, the smug super-illusionist; Woody Harrelson, the wise-cracking mentalist; tart escape artist (think Houdini with piranha) Isla Fisher; and street-hustler pickpocket (Artful Dodger type) Dave Franco. The group is bank rolled by industrial tycoon Michael Caine, and is soon enough headlining a giant Las Vegas extravaganza. Their trick is to rob a French bank vault by transporting an audience member, video streaming the job, and showering the audience with the stolen cash. They do this under the watchful eye of magic naysayer Morgan Freeman, a huckster who earns a buck exposing the tricks of magicians.Soon enough, an FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) and Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent) are working together trying to stop the next job, which Morgan Freeman has warned them is really a set-up for a huge finale. The movie has some really fun moments, but with all of Morgan Freeman's warnings that we (and Ruffalo) are always a step behind, we can't help but think ahead ... and there is only one super twist that makes all of this click.In fact, I would argue that there are too many twists here. The basic story was enough and would have benefited from us getting to know the main characters. Instead, they are merely chess pieces who spout one-liners in order. In particular, the characters of Woody Harrelson and Melanie Laurent could have gone much deeper. But that clashes with what the filmmakers were after ... big, fast, wild, glitzy, cute, clever, and twisty. So don't be tricked into thinking. Turn off your brain and take in the wild, twisty ride ... even if it does defy logic, and we know "it's all part of the show".

It's a rare treat these days that we get a new property to release a movie right in the heat of summer blockbuster season which is usually limited to huge comic book movies, comedies, and other franchise driven films. "Now You See Me" is making up for its lack of entitlement with an exciting cast made up of some of the best young actors in the business who are thrown into the mix as street magicians with hearts of gold. It's a rich concept of magic meets "Ocean's Eleven" that certainly raises a brow or two, but does this movie bring the real magic or is it just made up of mirrors and cheap parlor tricks?Read full review here: wp.me/p1tyJd-rC

Don't overthink it. That's my first advice to those who watch Now You See Me, an otherwise-terrific psychological thriller with a magical theme, in at least one sense of the word. The movie relies on the staple of the magician's act, the sleight of hand, as it repeatedly tells its audience that the closer one looks, the less likely they are to discover the secret. It's an axiom that can be applied to the movie as well. It's fast moving, competently acted, and contains genuine twists - especially the last one, which is a doozy.Our story begins with the solo acts of four magicians: the mentalist Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), the showman Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), the spoon-bender Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), and the stunt specialist Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). After each concludes a performance, he or she finds a Tarot card directing them to a particular apartment building in New York. Behind that door, the fun begins.Some time later, the four - christened The Four Horsemen - perform a most unusual act in Las Vegas. Using a volunteer from the audience, they somehow manage to rob a bank in France. Ridiculous? Yes, of course it is - but there you are, nonetheless. The money is missing. What's more, it suddenly rains money into the crowd. Crowd goes wild. This, of course, gains the attention of not only the FBI, in the person of Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) but also Interpol, in the person of Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). How in the world did the money get from Paris to Vegas? Oh, this is only the beginning.Next up is New Orleans. This time, McKinney plays a fun little trick on the group's benefactor, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine); he has everyone in the audience write down the amount that's presently in their bank account. Then he has the audience look at the number using a flashlight from under the seats. Meanwhile, the group brings out a giant check that lists Tressler's bank holdings. As time passes, the amount on Tressler's check declines, while those of audience members increase. How is this possible?Each time the FBI and Interpol think they've grabbed an ankle of the magicians, they've grabbed nothing more than thin air. Atlas and company are at least three steps ahead of everyone. But why? What is really behind all of this? What's the endgame?The key - and this is not a spoiler by any measure - is to bear this in mind: watch everything, but not too closely. There are clues everywhere. And when all is said and done, the last trick complete, the final twist may well shock you into silence. And I sort of like that. I love a movie that can pirouette from one direction to the next, a bit of sleight-of- hand, if you will, with the new direction just as plausible as the first. Misdirection is all afoot in this caper. It's all about what you look at but can't see.Now You See Me was cowritten by Boaz Yakin. Don't know the name? Well, he also wrote such luminous films as Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, Prince of Persia, Safe, and From Dusk Till Dawn 2. Not quite the pedigree you'd expect for this quality film. Maybe it's the artful direction of Louis Leterrier, who helmed the first two Transporter films and the Clash of the Titans remake. Not a lot of pizazz in that list, is there? Still, somehow, it works. Everything seems to click. The cast has great chemistry, and the performances are (mostly) nuanced just enough to stay out of the path of a gripping script. Eisenberg's Daniel is essentially the same as Eisenberg's MarK Zuckerberg - smug, cocky, supersmart. Harrelson's Merrit is condescending, a has-been with little going for him. Fisher's Henley, though underdeveloped, adds needed estrogen to the quartet - with the undercurrent of having worked with Daniel as his assistant. And Dave Franco - yes, Dave - is good as the youngest of the bunch; Franco is basically a clone of his older brother James, who I swore up and down this was. Huh. Ruffalo, Laurent, Common, Caine, and Morgan Freeman (as a professional debunker of magicians) round out the cast.One final note about this. Even after the all the magic, the heists, the twists, and the reveals, the very ending is ambiguous. It's like watching someone walk through a doorway without letting you see what's ahead; something has happened, something beyond the powers and will and even imagination of the magicians: something wonderful.

One genre that can really entertain when done right is the heist flick. For them to work one of the most important things is to have a creative approach to the heist or the heist itself. Lately there have been very few adding anything new to the genre, but with Now You See Me they look to have tried to add a bit of magic to the struggling genre literally. With a great cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine does it create the spectacle it promises or are the trailers all an illusion? Now You See Me follows an FBI agent and an Interpol detective track a team of illusionists who pull off bank heists during their performances and reward their audiences with the money. For once a film got the heist element right and delivered a clever and engaging story to go along with it. This isn't a perfect film by any means, but thanks to the magic element, which is usually a film killer, it takes it to a level that keeps things moving in an interesting direction. While the trailers showcase the magicians as the leads, this isn't quite the case. Make no mistake they are in the majority of the film and deliver the best parts of the film, but this movie follows more of Mark Ruffalo's detective as he is obsessively trying to solve this case. Typically Ruffalo is great and he is decent here, but just not up to par of his normal performances. Most of this is due to the character not being all that interesting and the attempt to thrust more depth into it that was really not necessary. The rest of the cast have great chemistry and chew up the scenery around them with Michael Caine really the only one with very little to do. The heists are fun to watch and ponder how they pulled it off even though some of them are predictable, but for the most part create a great presence on screen. While not a lot there are some great action moments here and there that were pretty surprising featuring Dave Franco that probably were not all him, but still fun to watch none the less.With the exception of some of the useless character elements to the Ruffalo character the rest of this movie is pretty entertaining adding a unique twist to the heist genre that has been missing. It probably would have been even better if the main focus had been on the magicians also known as the Four Horseman, but who knows maybe the less is more approach is why it worked so well.

Great movie. I didn't expect to like this movie just for the fact that I am not a big fan of magic. I expected a lot about this movie, which I can say led me to loving it. Like saying, it's unexpected. Most parts of the movie, as I watched it, I played in my mind trying to figure out how they did this and that. The thing that killed magic for me, is my curiosity on how magic works led me to knowing how it actually works. Now, during the movie, Thaddeus (Morgan Freeman) does give away how the tricks work, because that's what he does. And even before he explained it, I thought I knew how it was done, but I was completely wrong. There are so many schemes here and there that make you believe this and that, but it just twists stuff around, which is what makes me like this movie so much, they did an amazing job tricking you.I suggest watching this, yes. It's quite well made. You may go in expecting you will figure out the magic, but then again, you could be completely wrong.

Magic in cinema has lost a lot of its, well, magical qualities due to the fact that special effects and visual wizardry can be pulled off by even someone so much as a common man. Considering film was founded on the principles of perception, illusion, and amateur craft, it's a wonder why it's so rare we get a modern picture exploring mentalism in a greater sense. Finally, there's Louis Leterrier's Now You See Me, a film centered around magicians and magic that examines the world in such a style that it should be taken in carefully and with a potent sense of admiration. It's easily one of the more surprising pictures of the year, combining effective mystery with plot-twists to make for a ravishing experience.The plot: four crafty magicians, Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and Merritt Osbourne (Woody Harrelson), are united by an odd-force and a year later are seen as the "Four Horsemen" by a sold-out Vegas crowd. For their final act, they decide to summon an assuming audience member to state the name of his bank so that he can be teleported through time to rob it accordingly. The bank is in France and in mere seconds is the man transported, given instructions about what to do when there, and finally, the money begins to rain from the ceiling of the arena. Of course this summons national attention and FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is soon on the case trying to infiltrate the Horseman and discover what the underlying secret is to their tricks.Leterrier's directorial game has always been in the field of slick action productions, such as the first two "Transporter" films and the recent remake of Clash of the Titans, which he later apologized for. His talent for directing a picture that relies heavily on visual trickery and giving the audience the idea they are "getting it" when they aren't even close is meticulous and surprisingly precise. An interesting footnote is "Now You See Me" was shot with an anamorphic lens on film in order to make the effects appear not too hokey but not too realistic as if they were showing them done with certainty and complete accuracy.The trio of writers — Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans), and Edward Ricourt — however, encounter one issue and that is the issue of greater emphasis on plot and twists as opposed to character and development. The film features such an ensemble cast that does wonders making the material accessible, interesting, and immersing in the first two acts that, by the third, the events and twists have almost overwhelmed the picture to the point of the actors having to run to catch up with the pace of the film. This isn't a huge issue, but it isn't until the final twist is explained – that does feel a little rushed and sketchy – that you begin to realize you really know nothing about these magicians besides they each house enough cockiness to make up for two stubborn hockey teams that are entering Game 7 in the playoffs.Nonetheless, Now You See Me is a good film, but due to the cinematic mastery of special effects the power of magic and perception inevitably feels tainted. I'm reminded of how cinematic shorts got by in the late 1880′s when all auteurs had were cameras and the power of illusion; not slickness, shock, and trickery all created by a hefty budget. How would pioneer filmmaker Georges Méliès view Now You See Me? He'd probably dismiss it as blasphemy before getting back to work.My video review of Now You See Me, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Rceapdsz4

Slick, clever, stylish with some nice moments of humor. Everything you want in a movie. Sit back and enjoy it without too much analyzing of how possible or not all of it is. This is the most enjoyable film I have seen since Inception and that wasn't exactly a film that stood up to too much analysis.It is not just another magic film, there is a real story in this one. Sure, the tricks are spectacular, but there is an underlying storyline that provides for a complete movie, not just a collection of flashy moments.if you enjoyed The Prestige and Oceans 11, then this has the best of both and will be one for you.See it now before too many people spoil the plot for you and you might just get to the end without guessing every twist.

9/10 - this kind of rating doesn't come easy. Doesn't come unless you walk out of a movie in utter silence saying 'wha.. but.. wha-huh?'. Doesn't come unless a movie FINALLY, after SO long, manages to - pardon the pun - trick you. I generally tend to figure out whats going on in most movies and ruin them for myself. I was doing something similar in this movie and was being proved wrong all throughout - and i loved it. Oh, did i mention its funny too?Sure some people will want to pick at the nitty gritty and say a few things didn't make sense. I personally would let that slide for such a good movie overall - hey, if you want SO much sense and logic, go watch national geographic. All in all, you wont be disappointed. Great value for money. And that facebook kid - love his acting.Cheers.

I absolutely love this film. "Now You See Me" is like nothing I've ever seen before. "Now You See Me" tells the story of a group of magicians called The Four Horsemen who use their skills to pull off some of the greatest international robberies of their generation. Featuring Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKenny (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), the Four Horsemen make a dream team of street magicians. Since they have made their stunts public, allowing the world to "witness" the robberies, authorities are in hot pursuit of the four, now wanted criminals. Detective Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is accompanied in his search for the illusive magicians by Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and French detective Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). Will the Four Horsemen be able to pull of their final act without being caught, or will it be curtains for the criminal performers?The plot is so original and full of fresh ideas and witty comedy. I love how fast paced this film is, I swear there isn't a dull moment from beginning to end. The plot itself has so many twists and turns it should be a pretzel, but it keeps the audience guessing the whole time and hits you with major shock factor. The acting in this film is incredible. It features a group of incredible actors - Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson and many others. I love how each character has a unique quirk and personality that you can really see, but they all work together so well. The cinematography and special effects in this film are phenomenal. It is bursting with rich colors and textures, drawing you into the magic and making the illusions appear so real. The soundtrack is also amazing. It is suits each scene very well, while keeping a consistent theme and feel throughout the movie. "Now You See Me" is definitely not one to miss.It's hard for me to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder. Daniel, played by Jesse Eisenberg, often tries to assert himself as the head of the Four Horsemen. He is controlling, very specific and difficult to deal with, but he is also the funniest character which is attributed to all of his demanding qualities. I love every film Jesse Eisenberg is in and I think he is perfect for the role of Daniel Atlas. I also like Jack Wilder, played by Dave Franco, because he is the craftiest of the magicians. He isn't the "card trick" or "read your mind" type, he's just a good old fashioned pick-pocket for whom no door is ever locked.. He is sort of the "muscle" to the operation because he is able to help the horsemen get out of tight situations and he is also very funny.My favorite scene is when the Four Horsemen have to escape from the FBI after their second robbery. Jack Wilder has to stay behind to burn secret files. When he has an unexpected run-in with Detective Rhodes, an action filled fight sequence and high speed chase follow. This scene is filled with suspense, action and incredible stunts and it shows that the Horsemen are always two steps ahead.I recommend this film for ages 12+ because of violence and mild mature language. Overall I give "Now You See Me" 5 out of 5 stars. See Raven's video review on kidsfirst.org

The movie has lots of twists and turns like any magic show so you can keep on guessing right up until the end. All of the acting is done very well and you can see how many illusions can possibly be done. It definitely keeps you wondering all along they way so I wont' give any hints right here. Things happen in Vegas, Paris, NYC and more. All kinds of fun places to visit. Pay close attention as it goes along and keep trying to guess the ending, you will be surprised.Not a great movie but very entertaining to see. I doubt there will be any sequels or prequels like so many others. I am trying to get to ten lines, so I will keep on rambling.

I truly believe that somewhere down the line, film students will be taught Now You See me as an example of a well made film of the early part of the century. The elements of screen writing, directing, cinematography, and special effects came together in a flawless union that was carried out by irreprehensible performances from the cast. Humorous, quick-witted, and as delightfully entertaining as a Las Vegas magic show, Now You See Me clicks along at a thrill ride pace that is sure to please. The plot is so carefully constructed that, just like in a magic trick, you'll always think you're one step ahead, but you're really two steps behind. A brilliant and original film, and a perfect 10.

How do so many stars get involved with a movie so bad? My guess is that it was originally a much longer and developed film that got edited down. The final product is an absolute mess. Eisenberg, Fischer and Harrelson are the "Stars" (are they?), but they are only heavily used in the first twenty minutes. The movie focuses too much on Mark Ruffalo's character and oddly incorporates Morgan Freeman too much, then makes him out to look like a bad guy. Even Michel Caine and Dave Franco say very few words and are reduced to stereotypes. This movie looks you in the face and insults your intelligence. Its such a mess that I can't image what the producers and actors were thinking. Louis Leterrier, I should've expected this from a man still coasting on the originality and stylistic excellence of Transporter.

"Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see" - while the makers of this movie have been pushing this message ever since the trailers came out, even after walking out of the theater, it has been hard for me to figure out what kind of a movie this is - no matter how closer (or farther) I look at the issue!Alright, this is a movie about magicians (who call themselves The Four Horsemen, no biblical reference intended). But, is this a movie about magicians performing magic? Please stop thinking on the lines of Nolan's "The Prestige". It is hard to look at the movie from this "magic" perspective because magic does not form the essential crux of the story. Well, there is magic throughout the story, some of which well explained and some of which totally bizarre and unexplained, but the magic is simply not the central theme of the story. Of course, towards the end of the movie, people disappear in carousels, and re-appear in France; however, a simple climax twist not-so-well connected to the movie proceedings does not do enough justice to the infinite number of unexplained magic tricks throughout the movie. It would have been amazing had some of the mind blowing tricks been explained; the only plausible answer to the question: "Why were these tricks not explained" is that the story is simply not related to those magic tricks. Is this a heist movie? It started looking like one initially; though there is some stealing involved, it did not feel like one at the end. Wait, is this simple, plain revenge? Ah, the final minute of the movie conveys this idea, but at that moment, the viewers can definitely figure out the answer to the million dollar question: "What type of a movie this is?!", with the answer being: "Who cares!""Now you see me" is a perfect example of taking a good story, getting an amazing cast to work for you, but spoiling the fun for the audience with some poor screenplay writing and direction. For most part of the film, the story does not seem to head to any particular direction or with destination in mind at all. The magicians are supposed to perform three acts - first in Las Vegas, second in New Orleans, and third in New York City - and each act is supposed to top the previous one. While the first act sets up the stage for the movie, the second act creates so much excitement for the audience. Unfortunately, the final act along with some preceding and succeeding scenes is mostly responsible for the letting the entire movie, and hence the viewers, down!It is easily possible to write pages after pages praising for the entire cast, and they actually deserve it. Be it Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco who star as the Four Horsemen, Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent as the policemen who try to catch up with the magicians' tricks, Michael Caine (who, I thought, did not have much to do!) or Morgan Freeman, all of them have performed extremely well. Halfway into the movie, I started thinking whether Mark Ruffalo or Jesse Eisenberg was the main character, especially since Eisenberg appeared so sparingly after the first fifteen minutes of the movie, and it was a full Mark Ruffalo show from thereon. However, what was supposed to be a cat and mouse game between them did not create sufficient tension to captivate the viewer.The real problem lies with the script and direction. Though the first half of the movie sets up the stage well, it drags between the first and second act, and right immediately after the second act as well. Good writing should have upped the ante after the second act, but the movie sets off as a torn kite without a clear direction. May be that's why when the final twist - which is supposed the awe the audience - appears, the viewer is already frustrated with the one million unresolved plot holes, and hence, the reaction to the twist is: "Oh, OK! The movie is over, let's get out of the theater!" Worse, if somebody were to try to make some sense out of it, there are a million questions about the story, particularly regarding the fifth horseman whom Mark Ruffalo has been searching for throughout the movie - very contrived, the entire episode looked.In all truth, I liked the overall story and in parts, the movie was fun. Even the climax twist was not a let down, only the events that culminated in it were! If alone, they concentrated some more on those plot holes, if alone they had a more taut script to tie down the viewers, if alone the movie had a clear destination instead of the dumb third magic act, if alone Louis Leterrier and co. had steered the ship better, the film would have turned out to be an amazing heist-cum- revenge-cum-magic movie! Unfortunately now, the movie is none of the three!What I saw:Direction: 3.0/5 Writing: 2.5/5 Acting: 3.5/5 Music: 3.0/5 Cinematography: 3.5/5What I felt:Degree of Tautness: 2.5/5 Emotional Quotient: 2.5/5 Intelligence Quotient: 3.0/5 Entertainment Quotient: 3.5/5

Loved this movie. Gotta say the "cool" factor got to me in every crucial aspect of this flick. It is difficult to be "cool" without being corny or coming off silly. Even Woody H. is getting to be enjoyable to me and he's never been one of my fav actors. The storyline is simple and it moves fast with no time to get bored. Each character is acted out really slick, not superficially deep (although I would have enjoyed more character development) and kept my attention.The two heavies, M. Freeman & M. Caine, were very good, of course, and give the movie two solid performances that complement very well the other cast members. Mark Ruffalo was spot on - gosh he's good, why hasn't he made more movies I wonder? (Love him as the Hulk).Jesse Eisenberg is so dang believable that he better do something else quick or he's going to be forever etched in my mind as an illusionist! His character's glances and demeanor are great with, to me, an underlying sense of he can't believe how good he & the other 3 are at what they do. I loved that about each character - they weren't arrogant to the point of unbelievability or boredom. It's like they all were on a ride they could hardly believe. LOL, I kept looking at Isla Fisher and thinking, "Is that Amy Adams?" But I knew it couldn't be. And Dave Franco - the look-alike baby Franco brother did a good job with his smaller part.I know I've said it already, but this movie is cool. It had me believing that the tricks could be done. One of the best movies for what it is - entertainment, plain and simple. My friend and I left saying, "good movie, I liked that." Definitely a big screen movie.Oh, and guess what? They guessed the card I & my friend picked! How'd they do that??

This opened as a very low key movie release locally. However, I kept reading praises about it from social media, I resolved to give it a try and see for myself. I had a lot of fun watching, and I believe, so will you.The fascinating premise of the film begins even before the opening credits. We meet four talented magicians who had been summoned by a mysterious hooded stranger who left them each a invitation card marked by an eye design at the backs. A year later, they were the toast of Vegas, calling themselves the Four Horsemen, staging big elaborate magic shows. One performance, they picked a Frenchman "randomly" from the audience to create the illusion that he had robbed a bank in Paris. Police and Interpol get involved when money really disappeared from that bank! That incredibly staged heist is only the beginning of a puzzling roller coaster ride of a film that will keep you wondering to the very end. Director Louis Leterrier (whose debut was "Transporter" in 2002) has executed a very energetic, intelligent and most importantly, entertaining film. The actors were all so eager, smart and funny in their roles. Jesse Eisenberg is believable as a control freak street illusionist. Woody Harrelson was a down-on-his-luck mentalist is outstandingly hilarious. Isla Fisher has gone a long way from her awkward debut in that Scooby Doo film. Just when you thought Dave Franco is just a minor player, he will surprise us with an exciting fight scene and car chase. And on the other side, Mark Ruffalo is just so right as the harassed police officer who always seemed to be two steps behind the magicians. Veterans Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman add their cool credibility to the mix, as they always do to any film they are associated with.While it is a pity that we do not get to meet the four magicians more in depth, and some of the illusions and action stunts were too impossible (and too CG), I think we can overlook and forgive those little quibbles. Do not think too hard and over-analyze about the twists and turns this film takes you on (especially in the final minutes), just sit back and enjoy the fun ride while it lasts. It is, after all, all about magic.

Great cast, great effects, and at first, an intriguing premise. That's about it. And, unfortunately, that's probably enough to rope most viewers in to thinking it was a great film.Now You See Me is really nothing more than the plot of a Scooby Doo episode, and I say that without much exaggeration; it's that bad and that unapologetic in how it half-ass sets it up and throws together a conclusion.There are plot holes big enough to drive an armored car through just everywhere. Inexplicable and illogical doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. I have to admit that I was pulled in for awhile. But around the midway point, I was beginning to wonder how they were going to tie everything together and make it work. The more I think about it now, it almost makes me angry I spend nearly 20 bucks for this tripe. I might have felt a little better if the arrogant Jesse Eisenberg character had received the punishment he deserved. The "twist" ending should totally insult your intelligence (unless discovering Mr. Withers was the phantom of the haunted amusement park totally still blows your mind).Unless you're 13, or have the the mentality of someone that age, do not waste your money at the theater.

I hang with professional Magicians who ripped this movie. I am also a magician. One said to me that he expected the whole movie to have actual magic tricks. If that was the case go to a theater magician production. THIS IS A MOVIE. Everything that was done was based on actual magic tricks and could have been done with real effects but a lot was done with editing or CGI. This was done because the amount of time that all the actor/actresses would have had to put in to be able to pull off the effects would have been almost a year. No one has that amount of time to put in for a single movie. I enjoyed the movie a great deal. I thought the writing was tight, the acting good, I have two problems with the movie. One the editing, the fight scenes are editing so badly you cannot understand what is going on. Either the editor or director wasn't comfortable with themselves and elected to go with fast editing which ruined that part of the movie and actually pulled me out and I had to push my way back into the movie. Second, everything was resolved

What You Should Know – Look closely because the closer you look the more you'll ignore this film's foolishness. Like most summer blockbusters it doesn't make perfect sense, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun film to watch especially with that incredible, though unbelievable, ending.What Works – The misdirection is impressive. The story isn't about the four magicians or the heists they "magically" perform. While that would have made more sense this movie moves in cheap tricks and clever nonsense.What Doesn't Work – All the unanswered questions. There is a scene where a romance is sparked, but it never ignites and another scene where they argue about where they will go once they perform their final trick, but they don't actually go anywhere. There are a lot of missing parts that leave this puzzle filled with too many holes to see the big picture.What I Thought – Wait for DVD Now You See Me is what any magic act should be – fascinating to figure out and tricky when revealed. Mark Rafflo stomps around most of the movie so upset at any moment you'd expect him to turn into The Hulk and Jesse Eisenberg plays the same smart and smug "genius" he did in The Social Network. That's not a great mash-up – at least not great enough to see in theaters. Instead of having audiences leave in awe and applause, there is a residue of deceit and dissatisfaction.

Four street performers are recruited by some mysterious character and bank-rolled by Michael Caine. They decide to embark on what appears to be a socialist-inspired reallocation of wealth via "magic." It's Robin Hood in CGI but lacking in charm.Did you ever go to a Harry Potter movie and see rows upon rows of disenfranchised middle schoolers longing to go from invisible to invincible? They had read the book and fantasized about instant fame, power and popularity.Now take the most devoted Potterite and put this film in front of them and they will be bored and overcome with some of the juvenile "stupid" that flows through this movie. Even as fantasy, it isn't plausible.Woody Harrellson is fun to watch. The money must have been good for Morgan Freeman to smugly mug his way through....only to be outsmarted in the end by a surprise ending that makes you want to stand up and yell "Really?" If you like movie dumbness which paints business as evil and average Joes as victims, you might enjoy this. But if you want to see real movie magic, rent The Prestige. It's much better and it will actually require you to warm up some brain cells....unlike Now You Bore Me.

If you're are looking for entertainment and you don't really care about the depth of the plot then this is the movie for you. The cast was really great especially Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Mélanie Laurent (Melanie was really sexy), Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine. People who were just looking for pure action and thrill have really enjoyed this movie but those who wanted more said the plot is lacking and there was really no development in the movie. I didn't even know where the climax was. It has aerial shots that was used in big budgeted movies and you can see the modernity of the visuals used. Some parts were really corny like Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent's love affair and the time Isla Fisher went inside a big bubble and just levitated. It's not an analytic movie, I thought they were a bit trying hard if they were aiming for that. SO AGAIN, it's up to you if beauty is external or more of internal.

Don't be fooled. You will not leave the theater being disappointed. This film does not disappoint. The true magic is its ability to capture your attention. It engages you in the story whether it is outlandish or not, that is the thrill of the film. I was let down by the lack of character development overall. It was evident throughout the movie, and the audience never gets a true look into the protagonists' personalities, which could be argued 'adds to the elusiveness of the magicians' but it was definitely lacking in that department. This is partly due to the writing. The writing could have been better, but then again no writing is perfect. However, the film was a solid 8 overall for me. It delivered a perplexing plot of a chaotic and mystical game of cat and mouse. It did not fail to induce good laughter. The overall story inspired thought in the audience, and the resolution was closed well, yet still left room for interpretation which I enjoy. Believable? Hardly, but is magic believable? Appreciate this movie for what it is.

I don't know about you, but I like a movie that can make me think. Hence, my love for Christopher Nolan movies. One of Nolan's best movies is The Prestige, which is a twisty tale about magicians. As a huge admirer of that movie, I have been anxiously awaiting the next great magician movie. The latest is Now You See Me, and it isn't great. But it is a great amount of fun. There isn't a boring second in the whole two hours, and in a summer filled with big budget blockbusters, it's nice to see something with a bigger brain.The film revolves around a group of magicians called "The Four Horsemen" (Jessie Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco). During one of their shows, they somehow steal millions of dollars from a bank in France within the course of about ten seconds. How? Well, don't ask me. But that is a question that both the F.B.I. and Interpol are interested in. The two main agents following them are played by the wonderful Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent, two actors I really like. Michael Caine also stars as the Horseman's financier, and Morgan Freeman also shows up as a former magician determined to bring the Horsemen down.Going into Now You See Me, I expected it to be either really terrible or really good. With a cast as golden as this one, I would've hoped it wouldn't go wrong. It doesn't. All of the actors are having a blast, and we are with them. This is nothing but a good time from start to finish, and it will leave you guessing until the very end. The twist is impressive, even though I'm not quite sure I fully understand the motive in it.The actor that probably stands out the most is Harrelson. Here is an actor that will always have your attention no matter what he does. Harrelson is there basically for comic relief, even though most of the actors get good lines. Eisenberg's character is a good one, even though he is basically Mark Zuckerburg in magician form.Overall, this isn't even the best movie of the summer, so summer has been pretty good. I actually do prefer the bigger budget movies like Iron Man 3 and Star Trek Into Darkness, but this is good escapism. Don't let the critics or your feelings towards the trailer fool you. You will be pleasantly surprised. It's a lot better than it could've been. It could've been disastrous, but instead it works well on the summer line-up. Go see this, and ignore that Will Smith movie. I haven't seen it yet, but I think we can all imagine how that will turn out.B+

"Now You See Me" is a enjoyable popcorn flick. However, it tends to be more flash than actual substance.The concept of the film is intriguing, but it isn't done in an all too interesting way. It's just a fast paced film that throws a lot of stuff at you, but never truly lets you absorb what is happening. The magic show scenes are one of the highlights of the movie as it's full of energy and the right amount of flash. My personal favorite moment is a fight/chase scene in the third act of the movie with Dave Franco. It's shot well and has some really nice fight choreography.My biggest gripe with the film is the cinematography and editing. The camera is always moving, either rotating around actors as they talk or around the scenery. It's hard to focus and at times I became nauseated. Editing in the film is incredibly quick, which takes away from taking in some of these elaborate shots. On a positive note, it does get more tamed as the movie progresses mainly in the third act.The cast is fine, but only two characters really stand out. Not that everyone else is giving a bad performance, but the characters they play lack substance or any really good one liners. The best characters are Woody Harrelson's and Mark Ruffalo's. Harrelson's character has the best lines and the best moments. He's funny, charismatic, and at the same time wise. Ruffalo's character is the most developed and intriguing. He's an FBI agent, who seems to have luck always against him and we can't help, but cheer for him. The rest of the cast is either throw away, like Isla Fisher and Dave Franco, or interesting, but underdeveloped, like Jesse Eisenberg and Morgan Freeman.Overall, "Now You See Me" is an enjoyable film that chooses flash over substance. Characters are mainly paper thin as they're underdeveloped or pushed to the side aside from Ruffalo and Harrelson. The film has a nice soundtrack that gives it the right amount of energy. However, the dizzying camera work and rapid editing make it really hard to be absorbed into the story. I give it 2.5/5, an enjoyable film that doesn't always engage with it's high concept and original story.

The most I can say about Now You See Me is that it was okay. I don't think that it was spectacular like many critics are saying. Now don't get me wrong, this movie had one of the most interesting ideas I've seen in a while. The idea of magicians using their act as a front to rob banks and give some money back to the little guy was what drew me into this movie in the first place. But once you're sitting there watching its just kinda like "eh". I don't mean to sound snobby, I just think that maybe the movie talked itself up to much and it suffered because of it. For one thing the movie moves really fast for itself. By this i mean that once the horseman acquire their act in Vegas and Mark Ruffalo is called in to catch them after the bank robbery it just feels like i'm already in the middle of the movie. As the movie progresses it eventually catches up with itself, but regrettably this made it hard to watch. Also i felt like the protagonists didn't get enough screen time, I get that if we saw too much of the 4 horsemen it would have given away the secrets to their tricks and such thus sort of ruining the twists at the end but i felt like they could have given them a few more scenes that didn't exactly inform the plot but kind of provided some fan service. I think the thing that baffled me the most though was how supernatural the film got. I was expecting the usual magician tricks or y'know things that seemed a bit believable. But after the scene with the curtains and Isla Fisher floating in a giant bubble, all preconceived notions of reality sort of went out the window. So in conclusion i give "Now You See Me" a 6-10 it was so-so.

This was a really entertaining movie with a disappointing end. The visual effects were excellent. The magic tricks were entertaining. (There was even a card trick near the beginning of the film that the movie audience was essentially able to take part in.) The acting was was believable. (I suppose that you could argue it was good, but I found myself disinterested in most of the characters.) For most of the film the story made sense. Unfortunately, the writer(s) threw in one too many plot twists and pushed the film over the edge of plausibility into the realm of silliness. They also left a lot of loose ends dangling. Four stars might be a bit harsh, but so was the let down at the end.

'NOW YOU SEE ME': Four Stars (Out of Five) Heist film about a team of four magicians who rob banks while performing shows and then disperse their loot to their audiences. The film reunites stars Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson (who also co-starred in the popular zombie comedy film 'ZOMBIELAND') as well as teams them with an all-star cast including Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Melanie Laurent, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. It was directed by Louis Leterrier (who also helmed such action films as 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK', the first two 'TRANSPORTER' movies and the 'CLASH OF THE TIANS' remake) and written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt. The film is a very fun, fast-paced and clever caper film that I had a blast watching (for the most part).The film centers around four magicians: J. Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Franco). As the film opens they're all called to the same location by mysterious cards left for them. The film then fast forwards to a year later when the four are working together as a team putting on an elaborate magic show where they apparently rob a guest of all his money (seemingly in a bank they transport him to at another location). An FBI agent, named Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo), and an Interpol agent, named Alma Dray (Laurent), are then teamed together and assigned to the magician case as the illusionists get ready to pull off another big heist.The film is packed with clever magic tricks and witty lines. It's extremely humorous at times and the elaborate schemes are very involving. It's a little far-fetched and perhaps overly complicated but it's still extremely entertaining. I was blown away by the smart script, stylized directing and exhilarating pace. It's also highlighted by a great cast. Eisenberg is one of my favorite actors and seeing the normally really insecure nerd playing a cocky and overly confident ladies' man is kind of interesting for a change. Pairing him with the always fantastic Harrelson is cool once again as well. The rest of the cast are all adequate in their parts too. The movie does get a little bogged down at times, which is a little startling due to it's normal fast pace but those scenes are few and far between. For the most part it's a very well made and entertaining film. It's inspiring to see Eisenberg pull off yet another successful film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ucjLaVv_8

OK movie, as long as you don't think too much. Need a cadaver? No problem.Start with the cast. Jesse Eisenberg is cocky and too fast talking. Mark Ruffalo is calm and scruffy. Isla Fisher is screechy, like chalk on a blackboard. Dave Franco is the wrong Franco. Melanie Laurrent doesn't have the chops. Woody Harrelson seems to be making an effort and he steals every scene. The two old stars sleep walk through their parts.Like magic, film editing should be seamless. In this movie the editing is noticeable and distracting. Fast pace takes you from Las Vegas, to New Orleans and New York but why?If you suspend your disbelief big time and sit back and take the ride it's an OK trip. About an hour after the end credits you think back and think did I miss something and they hypnotized me into thinking this was a good movie. It should have been better.

Yes, a genuine disappointment any way you cut it. There's nothing clever or even very fun on display in this movie. You spend 95% of the film wondering why an actor as great as Mark Ruffalo agreed to play the dumbest cop/federal agent ever put to film. When you get the answer, it validates the film's own shallow stupidity. What a waste of a great cast. Morgan Freeman is useless and absolutely wasted in this effort as is Woody Harrelson. None of the Four Horsemen magicians are fleshed out at all and the narrative shifts suddenly between Ruffalo's character and brief peeks in to the actions of the four magicians. It just doesn't work at all as a compelling story.

WOW!!!That's exactly how I feel about NOW YOU SEE ME. Frankly, I don't see why many dissed the film. Perhaps, because this one constantly urged them to actually use almost 90% percent of your brain to decode the tricks in the entire movie from start to end.No doubt the movie is a mixture of numerous tricks ranging from optics to numbers to common logic. And there were also some that still remained to be explained; supernatural maybe. Nevertheless, the movie was both totally mind-blowing and mind-boggling.To be honest, I'm not all too crazy with Louis Leterrier as the director. I mean his take on the 2010 remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS was quite a disappointment.However, the ensemble cast was amazing, cool and slick; just as I had expected them to be. But the intricacies of panning out the plot was a complex one. So much so that there was an essence of solving a mystery a la the Nicholas Cage's film, NATIONAL TREASURE. There was also that essence of Dan Brown's "Robert Langdon" style which we saw in THE DA VINCI CODE and ANGELS & DEMONS.However, the more intriguing charm about NOW YOU SEE ME is that it actually compels the audience to think as to how the "magicians" were able to literally trick the audience. In other words, it's like watching that TV show, "Secrets of Magicians Revealed" with Morgan Freeman played its TV-equivalent of Mitch Pileggi who revealed how each of the tricks were pulled off.No doubt there is a twist to this one and you would constantly try to figure out who was behind the whole grand plan. At times, I was convinced that it was Freeman himself but he was none other than a red herring.I mean the plot got so twisted that I simply gave up and chose to sit through the movie as the end revealed the real mastermind. In actual fact, this person was right under our very nose that we didn't see it coming.I'd see it again.

Eisenberg, as I'm sure many will notice, is beginning to develop his own typical character: the quick-witted, arrogant-yet-jittery, young smart guy. But instead of running facebook, this time he's one of the top magicians in the world. And he's perfectly cast for it.The movie follows 4 magicians or illusionists in various stages of their careers, as they all receive mysterious invites to join up. After meeting, the "Four Horsemen" go all Robin Hood, robbing banks and stealing from CEOs as part of their shows, and giving the money away to the audience. The Incredible HulkI mean, Mark Ruffalo, plays the FBI agent trying to lock them all up, while Morgan Freeman plays the narrator explaining everything to youI mean, the ex-magician trying to debunk the magicreally, that's just a clever way to get Freeman to narrate stuffPros: - Everyone puts on a solid performance. No weak points acting-wise, great job on casting. - It's fast-paced, the action never hits any dull parts. And even the small romance scenes don't drag on long enough to take away from anything. You're pretty locked-in from start to finish. - Particularly great scenes between Eisenberg, Ruffalo, and Harrelson in the first half of the movie. - Great ending, if you've been paying attention. Cons: - You wish there was more dialog between Eisenberg and Harrelson. - The 2nd half of the movie might move a bit too fastagain, pay attention. - Somebody thought this was a Marvel movie for like 5 seconds, and had The Hulk fighting Gambitwaitis that a bad thing?...Overall, this movie is a solid flick with some great actors that you shouldn't sleep on. It clocks in at just under 2 hours, but it won't feel that long at all.

I was so excited by the trailer although I thought the trailer revealed more than it should.I had high expectations for the movie and it delivered more than I expected except for the ending.Different people will feel differently about the ending but in my opinion it was not much convincing, need to have more proof on how it happened. But apart from that, the movie had a good pace where everything is happening at quick sessions where you don't see scenes wasting time. Jesse Eisenberg was great again,I was so impressed with his arrogant character in "The Social Network" and he has actually inherited some of those characteristics to his character in "Now You See Me" too. His style of speech gives a great personality to the character he plays. In stories like this, (like Italian Job, Ocean 13) although our story leaders are robbers or con artists, we want them to win. We like them to succeed. But will NYSM story leaders win their game against the determined FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo)? What is Thaddeus Bradley's (Morgan Freeman) role behind all these? Fascinating and exciting movie "Now You See Me" is worth to watch as you don't know how the time pass by until it ends.

Rating: 3 out of Fordyce (Very Good)It is always nice to see something different at the movies. With so many plot retreads, Now You See Me is a a great mystery that is a lot of fun. The story revolves around four magicians, who team up to perform the greatest illusions ever. They have a benefactor, who is helping them, and when they appear to rob a bank in Paris live on a Las Vegas stage the FBI and Interpol set out to find out what is going on.The twists and turns in this one will keep you interested and curious. It all winds up in a neat little package with a surprise ending. Doing their jobs well are the actors who amaze us: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, Mélanie Laurent, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman all make you believe they are who they are. But are they? Go enjoy this movie and find out! It gets a very good 3 out of Fordyce.Credit Check: There is no bonus scene at the end, so go home unless you like reading credits.

This movie is a joy! Illusion, deception, secrets, twists, turns, suspense.it's got it all plus plenty of action. Some of my favorite stars are in this one: Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Michael Caine.just the line-up alone should tell you that you have a treat in store. And you do! There were more people in the audience than usual for this one, and they were all as happy as I was, evidently, with the way the film went because a good half of us applauded the end. If you want action with a pretty fair plot involved – which is so often rare in the land of action films – and a picture that will keep you guessing all the way through, this is the one for you.

I don't want to give this movie less then 4 because it was a fine movie.When i saw the trailer of the movie before buying the tickets it was such an amazing and interesting trailer and then they screwed everything in the movie..It was such a bad movie that i even don't want to think about it any more..Such a bad movie and whoever wrote that crappy script is a guy who is completely out of his mindIn terms of Movie Directing it wasn't so bad it is actually very good shooting.....But in terms of story and script it was a piece of crapIf your going to the Theatre any time soon, do not go this movie i totally recommend you to go to any other movie instead of this movieMaybe some people would like it but i didn'tat the beginning of the movie it looks great but after maybe 10-15 Minutes it starts to get boring and just an idiotic movie I didn't like 'Now You See Me' at all!!!!so am going to give it 4 out of 10 because of its grating directing but in terms of story it was so bad!!!!!!

Its one of the best of this year. A concept of 4 street magicians making big in US with an bank robbery and the events followed after that. Its engaging right from first sequence. Its fast paced,mind-crackling and the more you think you can predict the movie opposite it appear which keep you stunned. Great performances by all specially Jesse (still in social network phase), Mark Rufallo,etc. It makes you want to go back and see it twice to understand it better, and just like all magic tricks, some of it can't be explained and you are left with no answer but to believe that what you saw was true. And to me that's fun Trust me you will not get each and everything in one go. To understand magic and its illusion you need to see couple of times. It has a lot of wit, clever plot, suspense, magic, humor, twists, and action.Loved it :) Aabra ka Daabra ..... You will go KABOOM !!!!!!!!!

This is one of those movies that is somewhat entertaining upon first viewing but is easily forgettable and has nothing of substance to make a second viewing possible to enjoy. The plot is convoluted as we don't know what the main characters are doing or why. In fact, everything we know about the 4 magicians is revealed in the first 10 minutes of the movie and after that there is ZERO character development! The entire movie appears to have been made solely for the sake of the ending and yet it was so cliché that I was actually a little angry about the way they did it. It's unfortunate that in the filmmaker's attempts to be clever they neglected the most fundamental elements of storytelling: plot and character.Like a magic show without magic, you may find yourself somewhat entertained but inevitably wind up disappointed in the end because they left out the most important part of the show.

Thriller as a genre doesn't cease to entice you because it is a sphere that doesn't have a beginning or an end. The more you roll, the more you will have! Here's one movie that is a sphere in its own entity – 'Now I can see you'! It didn't entice a title, does it as a movie?The movie teasers let the plot out! So it's all the more fun to see how the script has been executed. Magicians turn infidels! That's the only thing we can leak out. How they use their talents is what is enticing! Looked like an old story to us but there's something new in here! Director Louis Leterrier, where have you heard that name before? Transporter series of course! His work seemed like an 'Oceans 11' extension but it is only a mere comparison because both the movies deal with heists. The director hasn't tried too hard. He's kept things simple and scripted quite a decent movie. Technically sound, the movie does have its share of flaws and importantly blank spaces in the plot itself. That's because the director has chosen to get the characters called 'The Four Horsemen' to do the talking rather than the plot by itself. When you see bad, there's always a good bloke who wants to end the menace. Mark Rufallo as the cop has his FBI shoes on and tries his best! Let's talk about the pace of the movie. May be the first 60 minutes were like a Japanese magnetic train and then the following time frame till the end seemed like a tad tiring disclosure of facts. Should the screenplay be a little faster, the movie would have been even more engrossing to watch. Seasoned actor Morgan Freeman gets his bunch of dialogues, at a very nagging time of the movie, making it all the more tiring for the viewer. Explanations for most unanswered questions were answered towards the climax. It seemed like, 'a few questions, don't have answers'! Finally an element of suspense that we wouldn't want to leak here doesn't quite go with the audience because the entire premise of the movie is not convincingly explained. Let's give the errors a pass, the almost convincing robbing techniques, highly imaginative modern day illusion depiction and not to forget the characterizations of each of the individual street magicians, this movie has every reason to be a time spending investment!

Its odd how many people liked this movie, when watching it the introduction of the 4 horse men was pretty interesting but what happened after was not so impressive. The "magic performances" are lack luster on the big screen. I'm not saying I can't suspend belief but in this film anytime something "magic" was happening it was rather underwhelming. The rest of the film you are following a cop that has no idea where he is going or what he should be doing next. If the director was trying to invoke emotions of pity and boredom then job well done. In the scene where the 4 horsemen are in New York worrying about being caught made me realize that I knew nothing about them besides they are magicians and they don't have the best group chemistry. So who cares if they get caught? At this point you have invested more time with the cop and you begin wondering who this story is really about. If you like crime movies there are a lot of choices and some really stunning ones but this film would not be one of them.

Having all the gloss, glamour and bedazzlement of a Vegas act, it lacks a definitive and in-depth story, and has no focal point in storytelling point-of-view. Louis Leterrier's thriller follows the heists of four magicians in 'Ocean's 11' style. Though it's entertaining throughout, and has two actors from the Nolan franchise (Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman), don't compare it to Nolan's masterpiece in the magic realm, 'The Prestige'.The whole cast is incredible, and play characters different from their previous roles, but the characters lack depth and texture. The character interactions and one-liners are filled with adequate amount of wit and humour. Though the characters seem interesting, their presence is lost in the stupendous situations and ridiculous twists.I have to say once again, the movie is spectacular and keeps you hooked from beginning till end, but there's a difference between being tricked and being cheated.

I remember seeing the trailers for this and I thought it really looked great. Reading some of the reviews on here, many of them "claim" that people with a low IQ dislike the film. Well, I don't mean to toot my own horn but I don't think I'm a stupid individual and I've seen thousands of movies...more than your average joe because I love movies. However, this was a stone cold dud. Decent cast, some real twists and turns but a blatantly complicated plot line that makes little sense and tries way too hard just to be complex. A truly smart film can be smart and tricky without trying SO hard. Now You See Me just throws in all kinds of tricks and twists without any build up or thinking about whether or not it makes sense. It was a very interesting experience when the big final twist of the movie was revealed and everyone in the theatre I was in gasped and then that was immediately followed by many people whispering "That's dumb," "That doesn't make sense." They are exactly right. The big twist has no groundwork laid for it and makes no sense at all but by that time you are so completely lost in the silly story that you won't care that it doesn't make sense.The cast certainly is not the issue for this film. The cast is actually pretty good. I'm just surprised they actually signed on to this but then again it is making okay money at the box office. I didn't much care for Jesse Eisenberg's character. That's not to say he didn't do a good job, I just didn't like him much. His character is smug and egotistical but fits the role nicely and carries the cast well. I thought Woody Harrelson was excellent in his role as a mentalist that can hypnotize. He was probably my favourite character and yet there wasn't a lot done with him which is unfortunate. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco I lump together because while they were good they were mostly underused and sort of the sidekicks to Eisenberg and Harrelson most of the time. I think if I was making a film like this I would ensure the four of them share an equal amount of screen time and have strong characters. But they do well. Mark Ruffalo is the FBI agent trying to get to the bottom of the group of thieves. Ruffalo is good, shows lots of intensity and the appropriate amount of angst for cop vs robbers. Unfortunately for her I thought Mélanie Laurent was very near pointless. I suppose she was there to give the audience yet another possible suspect, and also to give Ruffalo a romance but both those angles were completely unnecessary and her monotone line delivery was enough to put you to sleep. Finally, we have two legends Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. The best scenes in this movie easily are the ones with just the two of them on screen because their chemistry and on screen charisma is enough to carry any scene. However they are definitely blatantly used for their name power and the weak script does nothing for them.Given director Louis Leterrier is a talented director, I'm surprised at really how bad the film was shot. Were there some nicely shot scenes? Yes there was but few and far between. I have actually seen all of Leterrier's films and this was by far the worst of them. I will give props to them in the opening scene when they play a magic trick that actually worked on me...they picked the car that I picked...I wonder if it works on everyone? After that the film falls into a complex web of lies and deceit and completely silly twists and turns that make little to no sense. Perhaps there are two many hands in the pot. There are no less than five screenwriters and story artists on the film. Its hard enough to find two writers that can jive and work together let alone five. Basically, Now You See Me was a huge disappointment for me. In a summer of blockbusters you need something better than this. 4/10

This is a very good movie.I have to say when my b/f wanted to go see this movie I assumed it would be another 'guy' movie aka heist movie all about action and chicks in skimpy dresses.But this is actually a good movie! I was interested the whole time and the story is really good. I liked a lot of the actors in this recognizing them from other stuff, obviously I like Jesse Eisenberg.I recommend this movie if you want to watch a fun movie that is also not stupid because the plot is pretty smart for a heist type movie such as this.

NOW YOU SEE ME is crime/thriller film directed by Louis Leterrier, starring Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fischer, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman & Michael Caine.The film revolves around 4 magicians, who rob a bank, using magic. The police want to know how they did it, and why.The trailer of Now You See Me, was quite short, to be honest. It didn't reveal a whole lot of information, however, it gave just enough to engross the viewer. The idea of magic and detective worked quite well together and since it was a story never touched before, I decided to give it a shot, and so I booked my ticket for Now You See Me.My immediate conclusion at the end of this film: IT IS ONE HELL OF A TIME. Yes, magic and good acting has managed to get the better side of the audience. With such a great star cast, Now You See Me is a smart, intelligent film with many twists that will only be understood when watched under close attention. The final twist, at the end, is one you don't even see a mile away; its that good.So, Now You See Me is a great time. It takes a lot of thought though, but if you do so, its possible to understand the whole case and have a great experience. Like the title of this review says: magic IS always the answer to everything, including the ending.NOW YOU SEE ME: 9/10

I have to say I was skeptical about the movie when I first saw the trailer but I was blown away by how great the movie was when I saw it and I think it's one of my new favorites. The movie is a great mystery thriller with just the perfect amount of comedic aspects in it. I thought the acting was great in it with awesome performances from Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg and Michael Caine. I also have to give Dave Franco some credit because I was pleasantly surprised with his acting and I thought he did a great job.Overall, the movie was fantastic and I recommend that everyone goes and sees it. The plot is so original and well thought out and it keeps you guessing the whole time with new twists all throughout the whole movie.I defiantly would give give it a solid 9.

If measure for good magician is that his illusions are discover-able only by his own revelation, then this director is the best Magician in Holly- town. The explanation for each magic by the cast at many scenes are wonderful. Performances by the actors are really wonderful!!!Loved the movie. Twists are not small part of the movie, it kept us engaged till the core."Everything has a end" is the dialogue in the movie during the last magic event of the movie, I don't want this movie to be done here.. Expecting more from this team.. Definitely one of the best movies in the year. :)

7.5 stars, rounding up to 8. My family wanted to go so I took them, not eagerly after reading the Rotten Tomatoes assessment. Darned if I didn't like it. I think the key was, early on, just letting myself go and suspending belief. Some of the illusions just would not seem viable otherwise. What helped was the breakneck pacing. It starts out at 90 miles per hour and does not let up. No chance to reflect or get bored because once you start, BAM!, it's off to something else. The plot, generally, I do not find plausible. I saw the ending criticized elsewhere. Again, suspend belief and it is not a problem. Magic is kind of fun to me, and I think that helped get me through. I would recommend this movie to a friend, along with some of my advice above for viewing.

A group of magi cans(Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fischer, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco) are pulled together to pull off a bunch different heists, not knowing who brought them all together to do this. Two FBI agents(Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent) who are hot on there trail, will they be able stay two steps ahead of them? In the world of magic, nothing is what it seems.Everybody is pretty watchable, nobody really stands out. This movie has a lot of twists and turns, you just won't see coming, just when you think you know, it will throw you off completely. The magic scenes are pretty effective, it was quite dazzling. If you want to forget about The Incredible Burt Wordersone, then I believe Now You See Me will do that for you.

"Now You See Me" started quite convincingly that makes audience curious of how they did that trick. Their first show at Las Vegas as The Hourseman when they rob a bank is really interesting to see and I thought this movie would be promising, complicated and mind blowing. But unfortunately after that scene, this movie becomes slow and tries to be smart for audience which is actually not. I found myself bored and exhausted watching half of the movie. There are many questions to this movie that has no answer to be explained. The trick itself is kind of impossible and not makes any sense that only could happen in a movie. In other words, audience is forced to accept that the concept of the movie is brilliant. The chemistry between characters here are also poor development, chemistry is one of the most important aspect if people want to create this kind of movie. It's too shamed, they have so many talented casts here that should be exploited. Compared with what "Ocean's Trilogy" had done about their casts, "Now You See Me" not even close with that. Overall, "Now You See Me" is an enjoyable movie to see and quite fun. But don't expect this movie would make any impacts like their magician predecessors did in "The Prestige" and "The Illusionist"

I suggest you people to go watch this movie as early as you can because 14th June is round the corner (MoS!) , and this movie is high on background score(Brian Tyler w00t w00t!), a decent plot, tricky direction and of course, smart performers. The cast was so balanced. I have seen such a perfectly chosen ensemble after a really long time. Though Eisenberg should have been given some more screen space. And Isla Fisher is much more prettier than her 'Wedding Crashers' days.The first half is not that slow, but actually not much is shown in the first half in comparison to the second half which manages to keep you at the edge of your seats, mounting to a satisfying climax in the end.Morgan Freeman looked frail for the first time on screen-diluted pupils, weak mouthing of lines. And that made me really sad and worried. People might end up hating the movie because of the simple fact that it lets out secrets as much as it elevates the magic trick in the next sequence, and so on and so on- which is a bold thing to pull off. The mythological connection should be explored more in the sequel if they make one(confused if they will or not) . Overall, Eisenberg-Freeman-Fisher-Caine-Ruffalo & Co. will ensure you don't come out of the theater disappointed. The illusion-shots are superb. And please, don't keep guessing the ending before it comes. Let it grow and flow as designed. That's the key to enjoy a heist movie you know!

"Now You See Me" was a pretty good movie, I think it was really hyped up to be something that it wasn't because the previews made you think that there was going to be a huge mega show of an ending. The high points of the movie were based around the actual magic, as a whole the tricks were good, and I think that they did a good job of explaining how they pulled everything off. There was a little bit of comedy that lightened the serious mood, and once again the tricks made the movie worth watching. I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because the movie was cohesive until the end. There was really an incomplete ending with no explanation of what made their common goal so worth it. Overall, I'm iffy on recommending this movie. I wouldn't pay full price to see this movie in stores, but I think it is a good movie to just watch. - Christian J.

Its not often, that I get completely bamboozled by movie plots, or if I am, its so well done that it doesn't matter. Now You See Me did a fine job. I'll try to keep any info that may ruin the movie out of this review. Starring Jessie Eisenberg (Social Network), Mark Ruffalo (Avengers), Woody Harrelson (Seven Psychopaths), Isla Fisher (The Great Gatsby), Dave Franco (21 Jump Street), and Melanie Laurent (Inglorious Bastards), Now You See Me is about four magicians who all specialize in a different field of magic and are brought together mysteriously and hence forth perform around the country using their talents to carry out heists, pretty much in front of the FBI's noses, specifically Ruffalo's and Laurent's characters'. I was well pleased with the direction of the movie. The acting while pleasing lacked depth and the "love story" if you can call it that, was weak at best. The movie kept me engaged the whole time, while I feverishly tried to figure it out but it was difficult because it was so entertaining! :)In the end I wasn't completely oblivious, I figured just a few small things out but the ending was a surprise and right in front of my face. I kept replaying the tag line, "Look closer, because the closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see," in my head. I tried not to look close but I did and I saw less. :) Regardless though, I was thoroughly entertained and after all isn't that the point of a movie about illusion? To keep me guessing and entertained! I'd spend the money and see this one in theaters.

It was an typical theist with a twist of magic ,the overall concept was good as it keeps you guessing till the very end what is the trick behind the previous act.It is very much an watch-able movie where an old concept of an theist has been presented in an new way ,the end is quite interesting .Those who like thriller movies must watch it once .All the actors play an good job in the movie .Morgan freeman was as usual good with his effortless acting Woody Harrelson and Mark Ruffalo also did a good job .The back track that play's along the length of the movie adds a good touch .This movie is surely one to watch out for and guaranteed you will not leave disappointed .

The movie was extremely entertaining. I have seen many reviews that were complaining about plot holes, but I have none of the "plot holes" that they were complaining of did not actually exist. There are some unanswered questions, but none that I thought were overly important. The ending was slightly disappointing and a few of the relationships between characters seemed a little forced, but the strengths of this movie outweigh its weaknesses. It has a fantastic plot and lots of great lines. Most of the questions I had throughout the movie were answered, or clearly intentionally unanswered to be mysterious. Some other people seem to have confused style choices of the movie with plot holes. I have no idea why so many people have been so harsh about this movie. This movie is extremely fun, and very interesting.

When I watched its trailer, I thought it is similar to the Prestige and Illusionist. (By the way I loved both movies). Magic/illusions always fascinate me and it influenced half of my decision to watch this movie, while the other half was supported by the strong cast of this movie like Morgan Freeman, Jesse, Ruffalo, Woody and Isla. Although it does not stand anywhere near Prestige and Illusionist but that doesn't mean it is not a good movie. The movie started off very strongly and created interest immediately. However, as the plot unveiled, it turned out to be an average- Not bad but not great even as expected. As this is an illusion based movie, it keeps the viewer confused for most of the time and reveals answers in end. The acting was good, although the character building was weak. The movie still entertains till the last seen.

Good Plot, bad execution... I went with high expectations after reading all the great reviews. In fact, movie indeed starts on a high note which further raises expectations. Unfortunately, "Now You See Me" fails miserably after first half and director seems to had no clue how to end this movie so he turns four smart magicians who did great in their first performance and police interrogations into four ordinary criminals that runaway after their second performance..Phew! I realized, movie was going down-south from this point and it indeed never recovered. I am not saying that the movie was bad, but if you go with high expectations, you will be disappointed. It's easy to build expectations with cast like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, one of them had literally no role. Go with low expectations and keep your brain at home and probably you will enjoy it more.

Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.7/5 starsUnabashedly entertaining, relentlessly engrossing, and delightfully mesmerizing. "Now You See Me" is the kind of heist film that cockily displays the lighter side of entertainment in the crime genre with oodles of style and chutzpah. But the discerning viewer too gets his share of the pie with the ample twists and turns, which keep you riveted and guessing right till the end - a rare feat to accomplish in movies these days. Boasting of an all star cast, each actor brings forth a unique charm and persona to his/her role.The icing on the cake is the jolting twist at the grand finale, which knocks you spellbound and leaves you with a savory taste in its aftermath. You can't help but yearn for a sequel to this intricately wound tale at the earliest.

Perhaps NOW YOU DON'T, the second half of the famous line NOW YOU SEE ME, would be a more fitting title After we get to know "The Four Horseman," a group of magician/con artists using their showcase to steal from the rich and give to the poor (think David Copperfield meets Robin Hood), we don't see them very much or get to know them all too well. That's not entirely bad since Mark Ruffalo's put-upon FBI agent Dylan Rhodes constantly on the trail of the roving charlatans, each a solo act until they were hired by a mysterious backer to pull off three big heist/shows as a team is a worthy main character: Through his befuddled eyes we venture from one level onto the next.The Horseman include Jesse Eisenberg as a snarky card shark; Isla Fisher as a risk taking performance artist; Dave Franco as the group's physically-charged street fighting freshman trying to prove his worth; and scene stealer Woody Harrelson as a charming comic relief mentalist creeping into everyone's minds. Woody's Merritt McKinney is, by far, the coolest cog in the wheel. But once each score is done we're left with duped agent Rhodes lost in a perpetual cat and mouse maze.Along with an exposition-spouting Morgan Freeman, whose act is to debunk all magicians, you'll be guessing through each step: although the actual stage shows are downright preposterous unless you put this movie in the Science Fiction category. And to bring the cerebral mind games down to earth there's a prolonged fistfight and car chase leading to a giant twist ending too complicated for its own good, over-explaining the ultimate ruse and making everything (and everyone) seem simplistically sleight of hand in comparison.

Saw this movie based on Trailers. The Magical Acts are good. Jesse Eisenberg rocks. So does Isla Fisher and Woody Harrelson. But the problem with the flick is that the mystery is not allowed to build up. Morgan Freeman comes every another minute and solves it, not even 5 minutes after the plot is completed. And the ending. They could have made a longer movie by making a better end and not just leave it hanging there. I was with my 3 friends. And boy were we not disappointed! Don't go if you don't want to. Just don't in fact. Pathetic ending. I wish I had saved my money instead. No can do now. I hope this helps.

I honestly really tried hard not to fall asleep watching this film as it's disrespectful to the people around me and the film writers/actors/etc, but it was inevitable. The story line was absolutely horrendous and had no meat to it. Absolutely nothing was explained. 7.4 is an extreme misconception of what the film actually deserves as a rating. Please save your money and watch another film that is worth watching. Growing up as a child, I was a huge fan of magic. I've actually been to a couple magic shows as well. So...I have an appreciation for magic. I just couldn't believe their "magic" portrayed in the movie as I thought it was very poorly thought out. I was extremely disappointed throughout the whole movie and I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it.

Initially, upon watching the trailer and being a fan of practically the whole cast, i was really excited to watch this movie. However, on the day it was released, i searched up for reviews about it, just for my own satisfaction, and for some reason a lot of critics didn't find the movie interesting or suspenseful enough.My answer to that is: WHAT?The entire movie, every single minute was hugely interesting and suspenseful. And i have to admit, i was pretty impressed with the cast as well, except for maybe the interpol agent, since her character seemed a little too weak overall.Anyway, i went to watch the movie with low expectations, and good for me, because my mind was blown a thousand times more than if i had high expectations about the movie. It's an overall fun movie, and i would definitely recommend everyone go watch it, particularly teenagers. Everyone else as well, of course, except for maybe people who have a tendency to figure out the entire plot in the first 15 minutes.It's an entertaining watch and i am flabbergasted that there has not been much hype about it!

its an awesome movie, you walk out of the theater and try to learn the tricks that are done in there, has suspense and is exciting,has a element of surprise, you should watch it at least once or you shall die. I love magic, and films about magic, like 'Houdini,' 'The Prestige' and 'The Illusionist.' This is a film about magic. Although it is pretty high tech, a lot of the magic tricks in it are very traditional, based on trickery and misdirection. While it runs a little long, the fine acting by the outstanding cast and the high production values make this an entertaining trip. The brilliant heist caper and the fascinating realm of illusion blend flawlessly in the summer's most intelligent film..

"I was a hundred and forty million dollar distraction?"Distractions are key to magic tricks, diverting attention to successfully pull off illusions. Now You See Me is filled with great distractions that attempt to hide obvious flaws within the plot and characters. However, the big twist (which is to be expected in a film centered around magic) is a good enough final act to make the film superficially entertaining and enjoyable.The film has a wide variety of cast members, including Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine. In the film, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine's characters are portrayed negatively, which is a bit off seeing these old gents play personas that are far from their usual, likable statures. However, Morgan Freeman still gets his scenes of explaining exactly what is going on at the moment. The four magicians (Eisenberg, Harrelson, Fisher, and Franco) aren't very interesting as characters, mainly because they aren't given the chance. The film jumps back and forth between the escaping artists and the FBI, Dylan Rhodes and Alma Dray (Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent), that it becomes confusing as to who the main protagonists are. The way the film is put together limits character development, which is why even by the end of the film I found myself not caring about the magicians whatsoever. Their over-the-top personalities are smart distractions for the lack of character development.Story wise, the film is pretty much one big setup for the final plot twist. The viewer isn't told exactly what the motivations are for the magicians to continuously break the law. Therefore, it becomes slightly confusing as to why the magicians would abandon their successful lives in Las Vegas to become fugitives. The act of leaving their elegant lives goes directly against their personalities - street performers (who obviously love the attention) finally get their own Las Vegas show only to throw it all away. It seems as though even the magicians themselves lack information as to what the end goal holds for them. Perhaps if the viewer is shown that the magicians care more about being the best illusionists rather than having an endless amount of cash, their conflict throughout the film would be a bit more believable. Showing them to be con artists and thieves in the beginning of the film (both which have the end goal of making easy money) doesn't really help the story. But, the twists are elaborate enough to distract from the holes in the plot.The chemistry between Dylan and Alma, along with the action and chase scenes, round out the film for a wide range of audience members. While the film isn't focused on action, the chase scene of Dave Franco's character running from Dylan has interesting choreography and a good amount of suspense. Other similar scenes demonstrate that the film looks great visually. However, the CGI makes some of the illusions look fictitious, even though the film does not cross over into the realm of fantasy or sci-fi like The Prestige. In addition, a number of scenes are filled with real life impossibilities. It is important to note that Now You See Me can be best enjoyed by following the big picture rather than paying too close attention to the plot and character development. Ironically, the closer you look, the less there really is to see.So in a way, the film with a budget of $75 million is a $10 distraction for people who want to have a fun time with magic. Sure the plot and some of the characters are trivial, but that doesn't mean that the film can't be entertaining - and it is. And that's what really matters.

Magic.It is a mysterious phenomenon;even a simple card trick can leave u confounded,make u scratch your head. But when we are talking about a bank heist using magic,that is another level of level of astonishment altogether. 'Now you See me' is an intelligent thriller with great characters,breakneck pace and plenty to keep you interested.Jessse Eisenberg looks fresh and lends that youthful and charismatic persona.It was great watching him after 'The social network'.Mark Ruffalo does a superb job in his portrayal of an FBI cop. Ishla Fischer and Melanie Laurent are charming.The chemistry between the four illusionists is kinda good too. In the backdrop we also have Morgan Freeman playing an antagonist who is keen on thwarting the illusionists.There are perhaps one too many characters in the movie.So the character development is a bit low. What works though is that the story is told in a thrilling fashion and it is always interesting to see 'tricks' unfold. You realize that in the end it is all a trick but u keep wondering 'How the hell did they pull that off?'Therein lies the strength of the movie.It is also full of unpredictable turns at every corner. The movie will keep throwing surprises at you till the very end.Bored and want something different?This one makes a good watch.

If you like strong and logical plots, you are likely to dislike this one. It's all about appearances and show in this one, rather than actually being brilliant, the characters and story just ask you take their brilliance for granted. The story revolves around illusionists (implicitly portrayed as demigods I would say) and how they manage to fool everyone and get a little fooled themselves. Of course, with all this fooling around there are always chances that something might strike the funny bone, that is to say it has its humorous moments now and then but on the whole the illusions and tricks etc. is just more of a dazzle than something logical and realistic. There is not much depth to the characters and a lot of misdirection to make the climax more effective, but the misdirection only adds to the illogical nature of the plot and makes the story hollow.Having criticized enough the good parts for me were the cocky-as-usual Jesse Eisenberg and some of the funny moments but nothing else. Even the dazzle of the magic tricks was made slow and plain by all the simple filler like dialogues. Final word; skip it unless you don't have a better choice for a movie in mind.

I found the characters to be completely unrelatetable, kind of annoying actually, and no connection with any of them is really made throughout the movie. Throughout the movie you don't really know who's side you're on; almost like there is no protagonist or antagonist. You're always wondering who's behind it all and in the end they just wrap it up and throw it all together and logically it makes no sense at all. For some reason the two investigators fall in love in the end even though throughout the movie there was no romance between them or relationship development - its like the directors just wanted to throw a romantic happy ending in. The magic tricks are all unbelievable and unrealistic; if you're going to make a movie about magic why not throw a bit of real magic in? The soundtrack is terrible its almost like its there to keep you excited but really it just annoys you. Things that happen in the movie just don't make sense; a number of things just wouldn't happen in real-life; certain characters don't have reasons for what they do; its all just thrown together. Unless you're simple minded and just want a movie that simply entertains but lacks and substance, quality, or follows any type of logic then don't waste your time with this movie.

When I saw "Now You See Me" on its opening day, I honestly thought it was pretty good. It was much better than I expected it to be, but it didn't leave any further traces in my mind after the movie was over. For me, many of the tricks were predictable, but the movie as a whole was still enjoyable. Unless you are a total dummy on magic tricks, you will probably be a bit disappointed. Personally, I like movies that keep me hanging at the end. I don't mean that in a sequel-promising manner; I like to muse over movies after seeing them, but "Now You See Me" ended in a way that just left me thinking, "... that's it?" I think that this is definitely a movie that you should see, just for the thrill and fun of it, but it's not a keeper. It isn't something I would go back and see again, which to me isn't very satisfying for a movie about brain-twisting magic and thrill.

This movie is not bad, but not epic. Upon viewing the previews, I just knew this film would cast a web of deception on it's viewer eyes and keep you guessing from beginning to end. Sadly- I just wanted to know how it would end. The visuals were cool, the breakdown of tricks were good, the police chasing was good- but there was just something missing. Perhaps it lacked character relations. There was no in dept story behind the characters, nor was there a clear cut idea of why they were doing what they were doing. It just seemed like a lot of fast pace needless action. The big twist was forgettable and the ending was just, "eh". I would matinée this film or wait for video. The title was stronger than the film. Sorry.

'Now You See Me' was an excellently developed movie, showcasing brilliant magic tricks and great humor and snarkiness from the Four Horsemen. Both Harrelson provided the comedy relief and Jesse Eisenberg displayed the cocky arrogance from The Social Network. Isla Fisher debuted in the movie amazingly, but then her character got pushed aside and later, reinstated as fighting for control of the group subtly along Eisenberg. Franco was also very funny and did an amazing fight scene with Ruffalo, using fire, cards, and a high-speed car chase with fantastic explosions. Ruffalo's character was pleasingly befuddled with a humorous chase down in New Orleans which ended when.....oops, spoilers. However, his partner, Laurent's character was earnest and passionate about the subject of magic but was rather pushed to the side and later suspected of having choreographed the whole thing herself. But the movie itself was funny, intelligent, witty, action-packed, and everything you could ask for if you don't want a thriller/psychologically stimulating movie. It's an action magic movie and that's that. There's no philosophical meaning, no deeper layers like in The Prestige. But The Prestige was dark and meaningful, and this movie is more lighthearted, something to laugh and "wow" at. The stunts and tricks were amazing and the effects were great. However......... The movie could stand to have had more character development. I felt it was all action, action, action. Freeman's character was frustrating because he spoke like he knew everything, but he knew nothing. Caine's character was actually well placed, used for the purpose of showing the audience what a lying cheat he was. I liked the way the Four Horsemen's tricks were conducted to achieve a higher end. None of the stealing or giving back to the deserving was for their own good. Like a magic Robin Hood mafia. All in all, it was what I wanted it to be. You won't be disappointed unless you're looking for a psychological thriller, in which case, you're in the wrong theater son.

My friends took me to see this movie, by the name of the movie, I thought it would be a romantic tragedy or something, but I decided to not judge the movie by its title and watched the trailer. I had high expectations after watching the trailer. Once the movie begun, 10 minutes in I was already at the edge of my seat open mouthed. It's so amazing how the magicians outsmart everyone and keep up and even ahead of the FBI. It's so extremely fascinating how they're so smart and manage to pull off so detailed and highly dangerous tricks. They just do it. Whoever came up with this movie, congratulations. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
